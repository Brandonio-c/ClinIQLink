Te \ue001rst\nedition, entitled Harper\u2019s Biochemistry , was published in\n1939 under the sole authorship o\ue02e Dr Harold Harper at the\nUniversity o\ue02e Cali\ue02eornia School o\ue02e Medicine, San Francisco,\nCali\ue02eornia. Presently entitled Harper\u2019s Illustrated Biochemistry ,\nthe book continues, as originally intended, to provide a con-\ncise survey o\ue02e aspects o\ue02e biochemistry most relevant to the\nstudy o\ue02e medicine. Various authors have contributed to sub-\nsequent editions o\ue02e this medically oriented biochemistry text,\nwhich is now observing its 83rd year.\nCover Illustration for\nthe T\nhirty-Second Edition\nTe global COVID-19 pandemic has provided a dramatic,\n\ue02eace-to-\ue02eace demon\nstration o\ue02e both the power and limita-\ntions o\ue02e molecular medicine and epidemiology. Te rapid\ndevelopment o\ue02e highly e\ue002ective vaccines was made possible\nby the adaptation o\ue02e novel RNA-based approaches in which\nthe patient\u2019s immune response is activated via the endogenous\nexpression o\ue02e genetically-encoded antigens, rather than the\nphysical injection o\ue02e a non-in\ue02eectious antigen. Utilizing the\npatient\u2019s own cells as the bioreactor \ue02eor generating antigens,\nrather than some animal or culture, enabled scientists to use\nthe sel\ue02e-ampli\ue02eying capacity o\ue02e polynucleotides to accelerate\nboth the speed o\ue02e vaccine development and subsequent large-\nscale manu\ue02eacture. Te illustration on the cover o\ue02e the thirty-\nsecond edition depicts a neutralizing antibody, in blue, bound\nto the spike protein on the sur\ue02eace o\ue02e the SARS-CoV-2 coro-\nnavirus, better known as COVID-19, which is shown in red.\nTe epitope to which the antibody binds overlaps that at which\nthe virus binds to the ACE-2 receptor, the membrane protein\nby which the pathogen recognizes, binds to, and subsequently\ninvades human cells. Terapeutic antibodies thus protect by\nphysically blocking association o\ue02e the Spike protein with the\nACE-2 receptor.\nChanges in the Thirty-Second Edition\nAs always, Harper\u2019 s Illustrated Biochemistry continues to\nemphasize the close relationship o\ue02e biochemistry to the under-\nstanding o\ue02e diseases, their pathology, and the practice o\ue02e medi-\ncine. With the retirement o\ue02e long-time contributor David A.\nBender, Pro\ue02e. Owen P . McGuinness o\ue02e Vanderbilt University\nhas joined as a new coauthor. In addition to the \ue02eresh per-\nspectives and novel insights provided by Pro\ue02e. McGuinness,\nthe contents o\ue02e most chapters have been updated and provide\nthe reader with the most current and pertinent in\ue02eormation.For example, in Chapter 6 the description o\ue02e the Bohr e\ue002ect\u2019s\ncontributions to CO2transport and release \ue02erom the lungs has\nbeen \nreorganized and expanded, while Chapter 9 has been\nupdated and reorganized to include expanded coverage o\ue02e\nzymogen activation in enzyme regulation.\nOrganization of the Book\nAll 58 chapters o\ue02e the thirty-second edition place major emphasis\non the med\nical relevance o\ue02e biochemistry. \ue025opics are organized\nunder 11 major headings. In order to assist study and to \ue02eacilitate\nretention o\ue02e the contained in\ue02eormation, Questions \ue02eollow each\nSection. An Answer Bank \ue02eollows Chapter 58.\nSection I includes a brie\ue02e history o\ue02e biochemistry and\nemphasizes the interrelationships between biochemistry\nand medicine. Water and the importance o\ue02e homeostasis\no\ue02e intracellular pH are reviewed, and the various orders\no\ue02e proteins structure are addressed.\nSection II begins with a chapter on hemoglobin. Te\nnext \ue02eour chapters address the mechanism o\ue02e action,\nkinetics, metabolic regulation o\ue02e enzymes, and the\nrole o\ue02e metal ions in multiple aspects o\ue02e intermediary\nmetabolism.\nSection III addresses bioenergetics and the role o\ue02e\nhigh-energy phosphates in energy capture and trans\ue02eer,\nthe oxidation\u2013reduction reactions involved in biologic\noxidation, and metabolic details o\ue02e energy capture via\nthe respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation.\nSection IV considers the metabolism o\ue02e carbohydrates\nvia glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the pentose phosphate\npathway, glycogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and the\ncontrol o\ue02e blood glucose.\nSection V outlines the nature o\ue02e simple and complex\nlipids, lipid transport and storage, the biosynthesis and\ndegradation o\ue02e \ue02eatty acids and more complex lipids, and\nthe reactions and metabolic regulation o\ue02e cholesterol\nbiosynthesis and transport in human subjects.\nSection VI discusses protein catabolism, urea\nbiosynthesis, and the catabolism o\ue02e amino acids, and\nstresses the medically signi\ue001cant metabolic disorders\nassociated with their incomplete catabolism. Te \ue001nal\nchapter in this section considers the biochemistry o\ue02e the\nporphyrins and bile pigments.\nSection VII \ue001rst outlines the structure and \ue02eunction o\ue02e\nnucleotides and nucleic acids, and then details DNA\nreplication and repair, RNA synthesis and modi\ue001cation,\nprotein synthesis, the principles o\ue02e recombinant DNA\ntechnology, and the regulation o\ue02e gene expression.Pre\ue02face\nix"

Biochemical studies have illuminated many\naspects o\ue031 health and disease, and conversely, the study o\ue031 vari-\nous aspects o\ue031 health and disease has opened up new areas o\ue031\nbiochemistry ( Figure 1\u20131 ). An early example o\ue031 how investiga-\ntion o\ue031 protein structure and \ue031unction revealed the single di\ue031-\n\ue031erence in amino acid sequence between normal hemoglobin\nand sickle cell hemoglobin. Subsequent analysis o\ue031 numerous\nvariant sickle cell and other hemoglobins has contributed sig-\nni\ue031icantly to our understanding o\ue031 the structure and \ue031unction\nboth o\ue031 hemoglobin and o\ue031 other proteins. During the early\n1900s, the English physician Archibald Garrod studied patients\nwith the relatively rare disorders o\ue031 alkaptonuria, albinism, cys-\ntinuria, and pentosuria, and established that these conditions\nwere genetically determined. Garrod designated these condi-\ntions as inborn errors of metabolism . His insights provided\na \ue031oundation \ue031or the development o\ue031 the \ue031ield o\ue031 human bio-\nchemical genetics. A more recent example was investigation\no\ue031 the genetic and molecular basis o\ue031 \ue031amilial hypercholester-\nolemia, a disease that results in early-onset atherosclerosis. In\naddition to clari\ue031ying di\ue031\ue031erent genetic mutations responsible\n\ue031or this disease, this provided a deeper understanding o\ue031 cell\nreceptors and mechanisms o\ue031 uptake, not only o\ue031 cholesterol\nbut also o\ue031 how other molecules cross cell membranes. Stud-\nies o\ue031 oncogenes andtumor suppressor genes in cancer cells\nhave directed attention to the molecular mechanisms involved\nin the control o\ue031 normal cell growth. \ue028hese examples illustrate\nhow the study o\ue031 disease can open up areas o\ue031 basic biochemi-\ncal research.

Investigations revealed the vital roles o\ue031 inorganic phos-\nphate, ADP , A\ue028P , and NAD(H), and ultimately identi\ue031ied\nthe phosphorylated sugars and the chemical reactions and\nenzymes that convert glucose to pyruvate (glycolysis) or to\nethanol and CO2(\ue031ermenta tion). Research beginning in the\n1930s identi\ue031ied the intermediates o\ue031 the citric acid cycle and\no\ue031 urea biosynthesis, and revealed the essential roles o\ue031 certain\nvitamin-derived co\ue031actors or \u201ccoenzymes\u201d such as thiamin\npyrophosphate, ribo\ue031lavin, and ultimately coenzyme A, coen-\nzyme Q, and cobamide coenzyme. \ue028he 1950s revealed how\ncomplex carbohydrates are synthesized \ue031rom, and broken\ndown into simple sugars, and the pathways \ue031or biosynthesis\no\ue031 pentoses, and the catabolism o\ue031 amino acids and \ue031atty acids.\nInvestigators employed animal models, per\ue031used intact\norgans, tissue slices, cell homogenates and their sub\ue031ractions,\nand subsequently puri\ue031ied enzymes. Advances were enhanced\nby the development o\ue031 analytical ultracentri\ue031ugation, paper\nand other \ue031orms o\ue031 chromatography, and the post-World\nWar II availability o\ue031 radioisotopes, principally14C,3H, and32P ,\nas \u201c\ntracers\u201d to identi\ue031y the intermediates in complex pathways\nsuch as that o\ue031 cholesterol biosynthesis. X-ray crystallogra-\nphy was then used to solve the three-dimensional structures\no\ue031 numerous proteins, polynucleotides, enzymes, and viruses.\nGenetic advances that \ue031ollowed the realization that DNA was a\ndouble helix include the polymerase chain reaction, and trans-\ngenic animals or those with gene knockouts. \ue028he methods used\nto prepare, analyze, puri\ue031y, and identi\ue031y metabolites and the\nactivities o\ue031 natural and recombinant enzymes and their three-\ndimensional structures are discussed in the \ue031ollowing chapters.\nBIOCHEMISTRY & MEDICINE\nHA\nVE PROVIDED MUTUAL\nADVANCES\n\ue028he two major concerns \ue031or workers in the health sciences\u2014\nand \nparticularly physicians\u2014are the understanding and\nmaintenance o\ue031 health and e\ue031\ue031ective treatment o\ue031 disease.

The manner in\nwhich water interacts with a solvated biomolecule influences\nthe structure both of the biomolecule and of water itself. An\nexcellent nucleophile, water is a reactant or product in many\nmetabolic reactions. Regulation of water balance depends on\nhypothalamic mechanisms that control thirst, on antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH), on retention or excretion of water by the\nkidneys, and on evaporative loss. Nephrogenic diabetes insipi-\ndus, which involves the inability to concentrate urine or adjust\nto subtle changes in extracellular fluid osmolarity, results from\nthe unresponsiveness of renal tubular osmoreceptors to ADH.\nWater has a slight propensity to dissociate into hydroxide\nions and protons.

This asymmetric charge\ndistribution is referred to as a dipole .\nWater\u2019s strong dipole is responsible for its high dielectric\nconstant . As described quantitatively by Coulomb\u2019s law, the\nstrength of interaction Fbetween oppositely charged particles\nis inversely proportionate to the dielectric constant \u03b5 of the\nsurrounding medium. The dielectric constant for a vacuum\nis essentially unity; for hexane it is 1.9; for ethanol, 24.3; and\nfor water at 25\u00b0C, 78.5. When dissolved in water, the force\nof attraction between charged and polar species is greatly\ndecreased relative to solvents with lower dielectric constants.\nIts strong dipole and high dielectric constant enable water to\ndissolve large quantities of charged compounds such as salts.\nWater Molecules Form Hydrogen Bonds\nA partially unshielded hydrogen nucleus covalently bound to\nan electro\nn-withdrawing oxygen or nitrogen atom can interact\nwith an unshared electron pair on another oxygen or nitrogen\natom to form a hydrogen bond . Since water molecules con-\ntain both of these features, hydrogen bonding favors the self-\nassociation of water molecules into ordered arrays ( Figure 2\u20132 ).\nOn average, each molecule in liquid water associates through\nhydrogen bonds with 3.5 others. These bonds are both rela-\ntively weak and transient, with a half-life of a few picoseconds.\nRupture of a hydrogen bond in liquid water requires only about\n4.5 kcal/mol, less than 5% of the energy required to rupture a\ncovalent O\u2014H bond. The exceptional capacity of this relatively\nsmall, 18 g/mol, molecule to form hydrogen bonds profoundly\ninfluences the physical properties of water and accounts for its\nhigh viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point.\nHydrogen bonding enables water to dissolve many\norganic biomolecules that contain functional groups whichcan participate in hydrogen bonding. The oxygen atoms of\naldehydes, ketones, and amides, for example, provide lone\npairs of electrons that can serve as hydrogen acceptors. Alco-\nhols, carboxylic acids, and amines can serve both as hydrogen\nacceptors and as donors of unshielded hydrogen atoms for\nformation of hydrogen bonds ( Figure 2\u20133 ).\nINTERACTION WITH WATER\nINFLUENCES \nTHE STRUCTURE OF\nBIOMOLECULES\nCovalent & Noncovalent Bonds\nStabilize Biologic \nMolecules\nThe covalent bond is the strongest force that holds mol-\necules together \n(Table 2\u20131 ).

These forces,\nwhich can be either attractive or repulsive, involve interactions\nboth within the biomolecule and, most importantly, between\nit and the water that forms the principal component of the sur-\nrounding environment.\nIn Water, Biomolecules Fold to Position\nHydrophobic \nGroups Within Their\nInterior\nMost biomolecules are amphipathic ; that is, they possess\nregions rich in charged or polar functional groups as well as\nregions with hydrophobic character. Proteins tend to fold with\nthe R-groups of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains in\nthe interior. Amino acids with charged or polar amino acid\nside chains (eg, arginine, glutamate, serine; see Table 3\u20131)\ngenerally are present on the surface in contact with water. A\nsimilar pattern prevails in a phospholipid bilayer where the\ncharged \u201chead groups\u201d of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidyl-\nethanolamine contact water while their hydrophobic fatty acyl\nside chains cluster together, excluding water (see Figure 40\u20135).\nThis pattern minimizes energetically unfavorable contacts\nbetween water and hydrophobic groups. It also maximizes\nthe opportunities for the formation of energetically favorable\ncharge-dipole, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonding interac-\ntions between polar groups on the biomolecule and water.\nHydrophobic Interactions\nHydrophobic interaction refers to the tendency of nonpolar\ncom\npounds to self-associate in an aqueous environment. This\nself-association is driven neither by mutual attraction nor by\nwhat are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \u201chydrophobic\nbonds. \u201d Self-association minimizes the disruption of energeti-\ncally favorable interactions between and is therefore driven by\nthe surrounding water molecules.\nWhile the hydrogen atoms of nonpolar groups such as\nthe methylene groups of hydrocarbons do not form hydrogen\nbonds, they do affect the structure of the water with which\nthey are in contact. Water molecules adjacent to a hydropho-\nbic group are restricted in the number of orientations (degrees\nof freedom) that permit them to participate in the maximum\nnumber of energetically favorable hydrogen bonds. Maximal\nformation of multiple hydrogen bonds, which maximizes\nenthalpy, can be maintained only by increasing the order of\nthe adjacent water molecules, with an accompanying decrease\nin entropy.\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the\noptimal free energy of a hydrocarbon-water mixture is a func-\ntion of both maximal enthalpy (from hydrogen bonding) and\nhighest entropy (maximum degrees of freedom). Thus, non-\npolar molecules tend to form droplets that minimize exposedsurface area and reduce the number of water molecules whose\nmotional freedom becomes restricted ( Figure 2\u20134 ). Similarly,\nin the aqueous environment of the living cell the hydrophobic\nportions of amphipathic biopolymers tend to be buried inside\nthe structure of the molecule, or within a lipid bilayer, mini-\nmizing contact with water.\nElectrostatic Interactions\nElectrostatic interactions between oppositely charged groups\nwithin \nor between biomolecules are termed salt bridges . Salt\nbridges are comparable in strength to hydrogen bonds but act\nover larger distances. They therefore often facilitate the binding\nof charged molecules and ions to proteins and nucleic acids.\nvan der Waals Forces\nvan der Waals forces arise from attractions between transient\ndipoles \ngenerated by the rapid movement of electrons in all\nneutral atoms. Significantly weaker than hydrogen bonds\nbut potentially extremely numerous, van der Waals forces\ndecrease as the sixth power of the distance separating atoms\n(Figure 2\u20135 ). Thus, they act over very short distances, typi-\ncally 2 to 4 \u00c5.\nMultiple Forces Stabilize Biomolecules\nThe DNA double helix illustrates the contribution of multiple\nfor\nces to the structure of biomolecules. While each individual\nDNA strand is held together by covalent bonds, the two strands\nof the helix are held together exclusively by noncovalentFIGURE 2\u20134 Hydrophobic interactions are driven by the\nsurrounding \nwater molecules. Water molecules are represented by\none red (oxygen) and two blue (hydrogen) circles. The hydrophobic\nsurfaces of solute molecules are colored gray and, where present,\nhydrophilic ones are colored green. A.When the six hydrophobic\ncubes shown are dispersed in water ( left), the surrounding water\nmolecules (red oxygens and blue hydrogens) are forced to engage in\nentropically unfavorable interactions with all 36 faces of the cubes.\nHowever, when the six hydrophobic cubes aggregate together\n(right ), the number of exposed faces is reduced to 22. The aggregate\nforms and its stability is maintained, not by some attractive force, but\nbecause aggregation reduces the number of water molecules that\nare unfavorably affected by nearly 40%. B.Amphipathic molecules\nassociate together for the same reason. However, the structure of the\nresulting complex (eg, micelle or bilayer) is determined by the geom-\netries of the hydrophobic (gray) and hydrophilic (green) regions."

The extended backbone maximizes the distance\nbetween negatively charged phosphates, minimizing unfavor-\nable electrostatic interactions (see Figure 34\u20132).\nWATER IS AN EXCELLENT\nNUCLEOPHILE\nMetabolic reactions often involve the attack by lone pairs of\nelectrons residing on electron-rich mo\nlecules termed nucleo-\nphiles upon electron-poor atoms called electrophiles . Nucleo-\nphiles and electrophiles do not necessarily possess a formal\nnegative or positive charge. Water, whose two lone pairs of\nsp3electrons bear a partial negative charge (see Figure 2\u20131),\nis \nan excellent nucleophile. Other nucleophiles of biologic\nimportance include the oxygen atoms of phosphates, alcohols,\nand carboxylic acids; the sulfur of thiols; and the nitrogen\natoms of amines and of the imidazole ring of histidine. Com-\nmon electrophiles include the carbonyl carbons in amides,\nesters, aldehydes, and ketones and the phosphorus atoms of\nphosphoesters.\nNucleophilic attack by water typically results in the cleav-\nage of the amide, glycoside, or ester bonds that hold biopoly-\nmers together. This process is termed hydrolysis . Conversely,\nwhen monomer units such as amino acids or monosaccha-\nrides are joined or condensed together to form biopolymers,\nsuch as proteins or starch, water is a product.\nHydrolysis typically is a thermodynamically favored reac-\ntion. Yet, the amide and phosphoester bonds of polypeptidesand oligonucleotides are stable in the aqueous environment of\nthe cell. This seemingly paradoxical behavior reflects the fact\nthat the thermodynamics that govern the equilibrium point\nof a reaction do not determine the rateat which it will pro-\nceed toward its equilibrium point. In the cell, macromolecular\ncatalysts called enzymes accelerate the rate of hydrolytic and\nother chemical reactions when needed. Proteases catalyze\nthe hydrolysis of proteins into their component amino acids,\nwhile nucleases catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphoester\nbonds in DNA and RNA.

Since the equilibrium constants for these hydro-\nlysis reactions strongly favor the formation of split products,\nit follows that many of the group transfer reactions respon-\nsible for the biosynthesis of macromolecules are, in and of\nthemselves, thermodynamically unfavored. Enzyme catalysts\nplay a critical role in surmounting these barriers by virtue of\ntheir capacity to directly link two normally separate reactions\ntogether. For example, by linking an energetically unfavorable\ngroup transfer reaction to a thermodynamically favorable one\nsuch as the hydrolysis of ATP , a new enzyme-catalyzed reac-\ntion can be generated. The free energy change of this coupled\nreaction will be the sum of the individual values for the two\nthat were linked, one whose net overall change in free energy\nfavors the formation of the covalent bonds required for bio-\npolymer synthesis.\nWater Molecules Exhibit a Slight but\nImportant T\nendency to Dissociate\nThe ability of water to ionize, while slight, is of central importance\nfor\n life.

At one instant it is an ion; an instant later it is part\nof a water molecule. Individual ions or molecules are therefore\nnot considered. We refer instead to the probability that at any\ninstant in time, a given hydrogen will be present as an ion or\nas part of a water molecule. Since 1 g of water contains 3.35 \u00d7\n1022molecules, the ionization of water can be described statis-\ntically. To state that the probability that a hydrogen exists as an\nion is 0.01 means that at any given moment in time, a hydro-\ngen atom has 1 chance in 100 of being an ion and 99 chances\nout of 100 of being part of a water molecule. The actual prob-\nability of a hydrogen atom in pure water existing as a hydrogen\nion is approximately 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22129. The probability of its being\npart \nof a water molecule thus is almost unity. Stated another\nway, for every hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion in pure water,\nthere are 0.56 billion or 0.56 \u00d7 109water molecules.

Pure water thus is\n55.56 molar. Since the probability that a hydrogen in pure\nwater will exist as a hydrogen ion is 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22129, the molar con-\ncentratio\nn of H+ions (or of OH\u2212ions) in pure water is the\nproduct of the probability, 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22129, times the molar concen-\ntration \nof water, 55.56 mol/L.

We can\ntherefore use Kwto calculate the pH of any aqueous solution.\npH IS THE NEGATIVE LOG OF THE\nHY\nDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION\nThe term pHwas introduced in 1909 by S\u00f6rensen, who defined\nit as the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration:\n= \u2212+pH  log[H ]\nThis \ndefinition, while not rigorous, suffices for most biochem-\nical purposes. To calculate the pH of a solution:\n1.Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].\n2.Calculate the \nbase 10 logarithm of [H+].\n3.pH is \nthe negative of the value found in step 2.\nFor example, for pure water at 25\u00b0C,\n= \u2212  = \u2212  = \u2212 \u2212  =+  \u2212pH  log[H ]  log10  (  7)  7.07\nThis value is also known as the power (English), puissa nt\n(French), or potennz (German) of the exponent, hence the use\nof the term \u201cp. \u201d\nLow pH values correspond to high concentrations of H+\nand \nhigh pH values correspond to low concentrations of H+.\nA\ncids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors .\nStrong acids (eg, HCl, H2SO4) completely dissociate into anions\nan\nd protons even in strongly acidic solutions (low pH). Weak\nacids dissociate only partially in acidic solutions. Similarly, strong\nbases (eg, KOH, NaOH), but not weak bases like Ca(OH)2, are\nco\nmpletely dissociated even at high pH. Many biochemicals are\nweak acids. Exceptions include phosphorylated intermediates,\nwhose phosphoryl group contains two dissociable protons, the\nfirst of which is strongly acidic.\nThe following examples illustrate how to calculate the pH\nof acidic and basic solutions.\nExample 1: What is the pH of a solution whose hydrogen\nion concentration is 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124mol/L?\npH\n log[H ]\nlog(3.2  10  )\nlog(3.2)  log(10  )\n0.5  4.0\n3.54\n4= \u2212\n= \u2212\n \u00d7\n= \u2212  \u2212\n= \u2212  +\n=+\n\u2212\n\u2212"

Carboxyl groups, amino groups, and phosphate\nesters, whose second dissociation falls within the physiologic\nrange, are present in proteins and nucleic acids, most coen-\nzymes, and most intermediary metabolites. Knowledge of the\ndissociation of weak acids and bases thus is basic to under-\nstanding the influence of intracellular pH on structure and bio-\nlogic activity. Charge-based separations such as electrophoresis\nand ion exchange chromatography are also best understood in\nterms of the dissociation behavior of functional groups.\nWhen discussing weak acids, we often refer to the proton-\nated species (HA or R\u2014SH) as the acid and the unprotonated\nspecies (A\u2212or R \u2014S\u2212) as its conj ugate base . Similarly, we may\nrefer to the deprotonated form as the base (A\u2212or R\u2014COO\u2212) and\nthe \nprotonated form as its conjugate acid (HA or R\u2014COOH).\nWe express the relative strengths of weak acids in terms\nof the dissociation constants of the protonated form.

Many metabolic reactions are\naccompanied by the release or uptake of protons. Oxidative\nmetabolism produces CO2, the anhydride of carbonic acid,\nwhich \nif not buffered would produce severe acidosis. Bio-\nlogic maintenance of a constant pH involves buffering by\nphosphate, bicarbonate, and proteins, which accept or release\nprotons to resist a change in pH. For laboratory experiments\nusing tissue extracts or enzymes, constant pH is maintained\nby the addition of buffers such as MES ([2- N-morpholino]-\nethanesulfonic acid, p Ka6. 1), inorganic orthophosphate (p Ka27.2 ),\nHEPES ( N-hydroxyethylpiperazine- N\u2032-2-ethanesulfonic acid,\npKa6.8), or Tris (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane, p Ka8.3).\nThe value o\nf pKarela tive to the desired pH is the major deter-\nminant of which buffer is selected.\nBuffering can be observed by using a pH meter while titrat-\ning a weak acid or base (see Figure 2\u20136). We can also calculate\nthe pH shift that accompanies addition of acid or base to a buff-\nered solution. In the following example, the buffered solution\n(a weak acid, p Ka= 5.0, and its conjugate base) is initially at one\nof four pH values. We will calculate the pH shift that results\nwhen 0.1 meq of KOH is added to 1 meq of each solution:\nInitial pH 5.00 5.37 5.60 5.86\n[A\u2212]initial0.50 0.70 0.80 0.88\n[HA]initial0.50 0.30 0.20 0.12\n([A\u2212]/[HA])initial1.00 2.33 4.00 7.33\nAddition \nof 0.1 meq of KOH Produces\n[A\u2212]final0.60 0.80 0.90 0.98\n[HA]final0.40 0.20 0.10 0.02\n([A\u2212]/[HA])final1.50 4.00 9.00 49.0\nlog \n([A\u2212]/[HA])final0.18 0.60 0.95 1.69\nFinal \npH 5.18 5.60 5.95 6.69\n\u0394pH 0.18 0.60 0.95 1.69Notice that \u0394pH, the change in pH per milliequivalent of\nOH\u2212added, depends on the initial pH, with highest resistance\nto change at pH values close to the weak acid\u2019s p Ka.Indeed,\nsuch \nweak acid-conjugate base combinations, called buf-\nfers, resist change most effectively when the desired pH falls\nwithin, \u00b1 1.0 unit or less of their p Ka.\nFigure \n2\u20136 also illustrates how the net charge on one\nmolecule of a weak acid varies with pH. A fractional charge\nof \u22120.5 does not mean that an individual molecule bears a\nfractional charge but that the probability is 0.5 that a given\nmolecule has a unit negative charge at any given moment in\ntime. Consideration of the net charge on macromolecules as\na function of pH provides the basis for separatory techniques\nsuch as ion exchange chromatography and electrophoresis\n(see Chapter 4).\nThe Propensity of a Proton to\nDissociate \nDepends on Molecular\nStructure\nMany acids of biologic interest possess more than one dissoci-\nating \ngroup. The presence of local negative charge hinders pro-\nton release from nearby acidic groups, raising their p Ka. This\nis illu\nstrated by the p Kavalues of the three dissociating groups\nof phosphoric acid and citric acid ( Table 2\u20132 ). The effect of\nadjacent charge decreases with distance. The second p Kafor\nsuccinic \nacid, which has two methylene groups between its\ncarboxyl groups, is 5.6, whereas the second p Kafor glutaric\nacid, which has one additional methylene group, is 5.4.\npKaV alues Depend on the\nProperties of the Medium\nThe pKaof a functional group is also profoundly influenced\nby the surrounding medium. The medium may either raise\nor lower the p Karela tive to its value in water, depending on\nwhether the undissociated acid or its conjugate base is the\ncharged species. The effect of dielectric constant on p Kamay\nbe obser\nved by adding ethanol to water. The p Kaof a carbox-\nylic \nacidincreases, whereas that of an amine decreases on addi-\ntion of ethanol because ethanol decreases the ability of water\nto solvate a charged species.

An\ninternal protein network, the cytoskeleton (see Chapter 51)\nmaintains a cell\u2019s shape and physical integrity. Actin and myo-\nsin filaments form the contractile machinery of muscle (see\nChapter 51). Hemoglobin transports oxygen (see Chapter 6),\nwhile circulating antibodies defend against foreign invad-\ners (see Chapter 52).

Thus, obtaining pure protein may require successive\napplication of multiple separation techniques. Selective pre-\ncipitation exploits differences in relative solubility of individual\nproteins as a function of pH (isoelectric precipitation), polarity\n(precipitation with ethanol or acetone), or salt concentration\n(salting out with ammonium sulfate). Chromatographic tech-\nniques separate one protein from another based on the differ-\nence in their size and shape (size-exclusion chromatography),\nnet charge (ion-exchange chromatography), hydrophobicity\n(hydrophobic interaction chromatography), or ability to bind\na specific ligand (affinity chromatography).\nColumn Chromatography\nIn column chromatography, the stationary phase matrix con-\nsists \nof small beads loaded into a cylindrical container of glass,\nplastic, or steel called a column. Liquid-permeable frits con-\nfine the beads within the column while allowing the mobile-\nphase liquid to flow or percolate through. The stationary\nphase matrix can be chemically derivatized to coat each bead\u2019s\nsurface with the acidic, basic, hydrophobic, or ligand-like\ngroups required for ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, or\naffinity chromatography. As the mobile-phase liquid emergesfrom the column, it is automatically collected as a series of\nsmall portions called fractions.

In theory, resolution could be increased by reduc-\ning particle size. However, the greater pressures required to\novercome the increased resistance of a more tightly packed\nmatrix crushed the soft and spongy polysaccharide or, later,\npolyacrylamide beads. Eventually, small spherical silicon\nparticles became available that were physically strong and\nporous, with a high surface area for attaching various chemical\ngroups. These particles were then packed into stainless steel\ncolumns capable of withstanding high pressures necessary to\nforce liquid through the more constricted passages formed by\nthe smaller, tightly packed beads. The high surface area and\ngreater uniformity of these silica beads imbue high pressure\nliquid chromatography, or HPLC, systems with a resolving\npower that is orders of magnitude higher than that of the once\nfamiliar glass columns and their polysaccharide matrices.MembraneAAAAA\nmRNA\nRibosome\nSynthesis1\n10 Degradation\nUbiquitination98 \u201cAging\u201d (eg,\noxidation,\ndeamidation,\ndenaturation)Folding 2  Processing3\n4 Covalent modification\n(eg, fatty acid acylation)3'\n5'\nVal\nGln\nPhe\nAsp\nMetVal\nGln\nPhe\nPheAsp\nMetMet-Asp-Phe-Gln-Val\nTrpS\n2H+2e\u2212\nProducts\n SubstratesSH\nSHS\nSS\nSSGly\nPro Lys\nlle\nUb\nUb\nUb\nUbThrAsnAla\nCysGluHis\n5 Translocation\n6 Activation\nSS\nSS\nSS7 Catalysis\nFIGURE 4\u20131 Diagrammatic representation of the life cycle of a hypothetical protein.

As it rapidly tumbles, an elongated protein effectively\noccupies, like a spinning propeller, a larger effective volume\nthan would a globular protein of the same mass. Size-exclu-\nsion chromatography employs porous beads ( Figure 4\u20133 )\nwhose openings are analogous to indentations in a river bank.\nIf an object floating downstream drifts into an indentation in\nthe riverbank, its downstream motion is retarded until it drifts\nback into the current. Similarly, proteins with Stokes radii\ntoo large to enter the pores (excluded proteins) continuously\nremain in the flowing mobile phase, and emerge before pro-\nteins able to enter some or all of the pores, where their motion\nis retarded. The fraction of the pores accessible to a given pro-\ntein, and thus the degree to which their motion is retarded,\nincreases with decreasing size. Proteins thus emerge from a\ngel filtration column in descending order of their Stokes radii.Ion-Exchange Chromatography\nIn ion-exchange chromatography, proteins interact with the\nstationa\nry phase by charge-charge interactions. Proteins with\na net positive charge at a given pH will adhere to beads deriva-\ntized with negatively charged functional groups such as car-\nboxylates or sulfates (cation exchangers). Similarly, proteins\nwith a net negative charge will adhere to beads with posi-\ntively charged functional groups, typically tertiary or quater-\nnary amines (anion exchangers). Nonadherent proteins flow\nthrough the matrix and are washed away. Bound proteins then\ncan be selectively displaced from the matrix by gradually rais-\ning the ionic strength of the mobile phase, thereby weakening\ncharge-charge interactions. Purification can be enhanced by\nmanipulating the pH of the mobile phase, which in turn will\nalter the magnitude and even the sign of the net charge of each\ncomponent of a protein mixture.\nHydrophobic Interaction\nChromatogr\naphy\nHydrophobic interaction chromatography separates proteins\nbased \non their tendency to associate with a stationary phase\nmatrix coated with hydrophobic groups (eg, phenyl Sepharose,\noctyl Sephadex). Proteins with exposed hydrophobic surfaces\nadhere to the matrix via hydrophobic interactions that are\nenhanced by employing a mobile phase of high ionic strength.\nAfter nonadherent proteins are washed away, the polarity of\nthe mobile phase is decreased by gradually lowering its salt\nconcentration. If the interaction between protein and station-\nary phase is particularly strong, ethanol or glycerol may be\nadded to the mobile phase to decrease its polarity and further\nweaken hydrophobic interactions.A  AE\nF\nGD\nC\nB\n B\nFIGURE 4\u20132 Components of a typical liquid chromatography\napparatus.

In theory,\nwhen a protein mixture is applied to a matrix derivatized with\na particular ligand, only those proteins that bind that ligand\nwill adhere. Bound proteins are then eluted either by competi-\ntion with free, soluble ligand or, less selectively, by disrupt-\ning protein-ligand interactions using high salt concentrations or\nother agents. Recombinantly expressed proteins are usually puri-\nfied by fusing to their gene an additional segment of DNA that\nencodes a convenient ligand-binding domain (see Chapter 7).\nProtein Purity Is Assessed by\nPoly\nacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis\n(PAGE)\nThe most widely used method for determining a sample\u2019s\npro\ntein composition is SDS-PAGE\u2014polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of the anionic detergent\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Electrophoresis separates\ncharged biomolecules based on the rates at which they migrate\nthrough a porous matrix in an applied electrical field. For\nSDS-PAGE, proteins migrate as SDS-polypeptide complexes\nthrough a polyacrylamide matrix. Binding of SDS causes most\npolypeptides to unfold or denature. When used in conjunc-\ntion with 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol to reduce and\nbreak disulfide bonds ( Figure 4\u20134 ), SDS-PAGE separates the\ncomponent polypeptides of multimeric proteins. On average,\neach SDS-polypeptide complex contains one molecule of SDS\nfor every two peptide bonds. The large number of anionic SDSmolecules, each bearing a charge of \u20131, overwhelms the charge\ncontributions of the amino acid functional groups endogenous\nto a typical polypeptide, rendering the charge-to-mass ratio of\neach SDS-polypeptide complex approximately equal. Under\nthese circumstances, the larger the polypeptide, the greater\nthe physical resistance its SDS-polypeptide complex encoun-\nters as it moves through the acrylamide matrix. Consequently,\nSDS-PAGE separates most polypeptides based on their rela-\ntive molecular mass ( Mr). Upon completion, the individual\npolypeptides trapped in the polyacry\nlamide gel are visualized\nby staining with dyes such as Coomassie Blue ( Figure 4\u20135 ).\nIsoelectric Focusing (IEF)\nUsing polyionic buffers called ampholytes and an applied electric\nfie\nld, a pH gradient can be established within a polyacrylamide\nmatrix. Applied proteins migrate until they reach the region of\nthe matrix where the pH matches their isoelectric point (pI), the\npH at which a molecule\u2019s net charge is 0. IEF frequently is used in\nconjunction with SDS-PAGE for two-dimensional electrophore-\nsis, which separates polypeptides based on pI in one dimension\nand on Mrin the second ( Figure 4\u20136 ). Two-dimensional electro-\nphoresis is particularly well suited for separating the components\nwithin complex mixtures of proteins.\nSANGER WAS THE FIRST TO\nDETERMINE \nTHE SEQUENCE\nOF A POLYPEPTIDE\nWhile scientists found it relatively simple to determine the\namino \nacid composition of purified proteins, the proportion\nof each type of amino acid in the polypeptide, deriving the\norder or sequence of the amino acids proved difficult.

Mature insulin consists of the 21-residue\nA chain and the 30-residue B chain linked by disulfide bonds.\nSanger reduced the disulfide bonds (see Figure 4\u20134), separated\nthe A and B chains, and cleaved each chain into smaller and\nsmaller peptides using the proteolytic enzymes trypsin, chy-\nmotrypsin, and pepsin followed by incubation with hydro-\nchloric acid. Each peptide in the mixture was isolated, treated\nwith 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Sanger reagent), and their\namino acid composition determined. Sanger reagent reacts\nwith the exposed \u03b1-amino groups of the amino-terminal resi-\ndues, allowing the amino-terminal amino acid of each peptide\nto be identified. The \u03b5-amino group of lysine also reacts with\nSanger reagent; but since an amino-terminal lysine reacts with\n2 molecules of Sanger reagent, it is readily distinguished from\na lysine from the interior of a peptide. Working from di- and\ntripeptides up through progressively larger fragments, Sanger\nwas able to reconstruct the complete sequence of insulin.\nSanger would later develop the dideoxy method for sequencing\nDNA, an accomplishment for which he was awarded a second\nNobel Prize in 1980.\nEDMAN DEVISED THE FIRST\nPRACTICAL \nMETHOD FOR\nPEPTIDE SEQUENCING\nSanger\u2019s labor-intensive approach rendered it prohibitively dif-\nficul\nt to apply to any but the smallest polypeptides. Pehr Edman\ndiscovered a reagent, phenyl isothiocyanate (Edman reagent),that not only could selectively label the amino-terminal resi-\ndue of a peptide as its phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) deriva-\ntive but, in contrast to Sanger reagent, permitted the PTH\nderivative to be removed under mild conditions ( Figure 4\u20137 ).\nThe new amino terminal residue could then be treated with\nEdman reagent and the process repeated to permit each suc-\ncessive residue in a peptide to be derivatized.\nWhile, in theory, one could determine the entire sequence\nof a polypeptide using Edman reagent, the heterogeneous\nchemical properties of the amino acids meant that every step\nin the procedure represented a compromise between effi-\nciency for any particular amino acid or set of amino acids and\nthe flexibility needed to accommodate all 20. Consequently,\neach step in the process operates at less than 100% efficiency,\nwhich leads to the accumulation of polypeptide fragments\nwith varying N-termini that eventually renders it impossibleN\nHH\nN\nRO\nR\ue000NH2\nO\nS\nO RPhenylisothiocyanate (Edman reagent)\nand a \npeptide\nN\nHH\nN\nRO\nR\ue000N\nHS\nNH\nO\nA phenylthiohydantoic acid\nN\nHNH2O\nRN\n NH\nA phenylthiohydantoin and a peptide\nshorter \nby one residueS C N\nH2O H+, nitro-\nmethane\n++\nFIGURE 4\u20137 The Edman reaction.

As a result,\nthe read length for Edman sequencing varies from 5 to 30\namino acid residues depending on the quantity and purity\nof the peptide, hardly enough to determine the sequence of a\ntypical protein.\nTo determine the complete sequence of a polypep-\ntide several hundred residues in length, a protein must be\ncleaved into smaller peptides. These were then purified\nand analyzed by Edman sequencing. This yielded multiple\nsegments of sequence whose location within the protein,\nwith the exception of the amino terminus, was unknown.\nIn order to assemble these short peptide sequences into the\ncomplete sequence of the intact polypeptide, it was neces-\nsary to generate and analyze additional peptides in search\nof some whose sequences overlapped with one another,\nthereby allowing larger segments of sequence to be pieced\ntogether. While the development of automated Edman\nsequencers and sophisticated HPLC systems for purifying\npeptides often rendered initial acquisition of a fragmen-\ntary, or partial, sequence relatively quick, finding enough\n\u201coverlap\u201d peptides to reconstruct the complete sequence of a\ntypical protein via the Edman technique generally required\nlarge quantities of purified protein and, more importantly,\nseveral months or years of additional work. Consequently,\nthe determination of a complete amino acid sequence via\nthe Edman method generally was restricted to highly abun-\ndant, readily purified proteins.\nMOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nREVOL\nUTIONIZED\nTHE DETERMINATION OF\nPRIMARY STRUCTURE\nThe sequence for each and every protein in an organism\nis \nencoded in the latter\u2019s genome. By enabling scientists to\ndecode the sequences of proteins directly from their structural\ngenes, molecular biology revolutionized amino acid sequence\nanalysis. The reasons for this were twofold. First, recombinant\ntechniques permit researchers to manufacture a virtually infi-\nnite supply of DNA from even minute quantities of template\npresent in the original sample (see Chapter 39), regardless of\nthe encoded protein product\u2019s natural abundance or ease of\nisolation. Second, DNA sequencing is far more efficient than\nthe Edman technique. Today, automated sequenators routinely\n\u201cread\u201d DNA sequences several thousand deoxyribonucleotides\nin length. Consequently, if one could determine just a portion\nof the sequence of a polypeptide of interest by Edman analysis,\none could synthesize a complementary oligonucleotide probe\nwith which to identify the DNA clone containing the gene of\ninterest. The result was a hybrid approach in which Edman\nchemistry was employed to obtain a partial sequence that was\nsubsequently exploited to determine the complete amino acid\nsequence by DNA cloning and sequencing.GENOMICS ENABLES PROTEINS\nT\nO BE IDENTIFIED FROM SMALL\nAMOUNTS OF SEQUENCE DATA\nToday the number of organisms for which the complete DNA\nsequence \nof their genomes has been determined numbers in\nthe hundreds of thousands. Thus, for most research scien-\ntists the genetically encoded sequence of the protein(s) with\nwhich they are working has already been determined and\ncan be accessed in a database such as GenBank. To make an\nunambiguous identification of the amino acid sequence for\na protein, sometimes all that is required is the identities of\nas few as five or six consecutive residues. Today mass spec-\ntrometry (MS) has largely replaced the Edman technique as\nthe method of choice for protein identification.\nMASS SPECTROMETRY\nCAN \nDETECT COVALENT\nMODIFICATIONS\nThe development of mass spectrometric (MS) methods that\noffer \nsuperior sensitivity, speed, and capacity to detect post-\ntranslational modifications ( Table 4\u20131 ) has led to its replace-\nment of the Edman technique as the method of choice for\nprotein identification.\nMASS SPECTROMETERS COME\nIN \nVARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS\nIn a simple, single quadrupole mass spectrometer, a sample\nis \nplaced under vacuum and allowed to vaporize in the pres-\nence of a proton donor to impart a positive charge.

Since\u2014\nwith the exceptions of (1) leucine and isoleucine and (2) glu-\ntamine and lysine\u2014the molecular mass of each amino acid is\nunique, the sequence of the peptide can be reconstructed from\nthe masses of its fragments.\nTandem Mass Spectrometry\nComplex peptide mixtures can be analyzed, without prior\npurification, by tandem MS, which emplo\nys the equivalent of\ntwo mass spectrometers linked in series. For this reason, anal-\nysis by tandem instruments is often referred to as MS\u2013MS , orMS2. The first mass spectrometer separates individual pep-\ntides based o\nn their differences in mass. By adjusting the field\nstrength of the first magnet, a single peptide can be directed\ninto the second mass spectrometer, where fragments are gen-\nerated and their masses are determined. Alternatively, they\ncan be held in an electromagnetic ion trap located between\nthe two quadrupoles and selectively delivered to the second\nquadrupole instead of being lost when the first quadrupole is\nset to select ions of a different mass.\nTandem MS can be used to screen blood samples from new-\nborns for the presence and concentrations of amino acids, fatty\nacids, and other metabolites. Abnormalities in metabolite levels\ncan serve as diagnostic indicators for a variety of genetic dis-\norders, such as phenylketonuria, ethylmalonic encephalopathy,\nand glutaric acidemia type 1. In recent years a new generation\nof tandem mass spectrometers has appeared, called Q-TOF-MS,\nthat couple quadrupole (Q) and time-of-flight (TOF) technolo-\ngies together in order to harness the best aspects of each.\nPROTEOMICS & THE PROTEOME\nThe Goal of Proteomics Is to Identify\nthe \nEntire Complement of Proteins\nElaborated by a Cell Under Diverse\nConditions\nWhile the sequence of the human genome is known, the pic-\nture \nit provides is both static and incomplete.

Many proteins undergo posttranslational\nmodifications during maturation into functionally competent\nforms or as a means of regulating their properties. In order to\nobtain a more complete and dynamic molecular description of\nliving organisms, scientists are working to determine the pro-\nteome , a term that refers to the identity, abundance, and state\nof modification of the entire suite of proteins expressed by an\nindividual cell at a particular time. Since the proteome for each\ncomponent cell of an organism is distinct and changes with\ntime and circumstances, the ultimate, comprehensive human\nproteome constitutes a target of formidable size and complexity.\nSimultaneous Determination of\nHundreds \nof Proteins Is Technically\nChallenging\nA key goal of proteomics is the identification of proteins whose\nlevels \nof expression or modification correlate with medically\nsignificant events. In addition to their potential as diagnostic\nindicators, these protein biomarkers may provide important\nclues concerning the root causes and mechanisms of a specific\nphysiologic condition or disease. First-generation proteomics\nemployed SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional electrophoresis to\nresolve the proteins in a biologic sample one from another, fol-\nlowed by determination of the amino acid sequence of their\namino terminus by the Edman method. Identities were deter-\nmined by searching available polypeptide sequences for pro-\nteins that contained a matching N-terminal sequence as well as\na similar Mrand, for 2D gels, pI.\nThese early efforts were constrained by the limited num-\nber of polypeptide sequences available and the difficulties in\nisolating polypeptides from the gels in sufficient quantities\nfor Edman analysis. Attempts to increase resolving power and\nsample yield by increasing the size of the gels were only mar-\nginally successful. Eventually, the development of mass spec-\ntrometric techniques provided a means for protein sequence\ndetermination whose sensitivity was compatible with electro-\nphoretic separation approaches.\nKnowledge of the genome sequence of the organism in\nquestion greatly facilitated identification by providing a com-\nprehensive set of DNA-encoded polypeptide sequences. It also\nprovided the nucleotide sequence data from which to con-\nstruct gene arrays, sometimes called DNA chips , containing\nhundreds of distinct oligonucleotide probes. These chips could\nthen be used to detect the presence of mRNAs containing\ncomplementary nucleotide sequences. While changes in the\nexpression of the mRNA encoding a protein do not necessarily\nreflect comparable changes in the level of the corresponding\nprotein, gene arrays were both less technically demanding and\nmore sensitive than first-generation proteomic approaches,\nparticularly with respect to low abundance proteins.\nSecond-generation proteomics coupled newly developed\nnanoscale chromatographic techniques with MS. The pro-\nteins in a biologic sample are first treated with a protease tohydrolyze them into smaller peptides that are then subject to\nreversed-phase, ion-exchange, or size-exclusion chromatogra-\nphy to apportion the vast number of peptides into smaller sub-\nsets more amenable to analysis. These subsets are analyzed by\ninjecting the column eluent directly into a double quadrupole\nor TOF mass spectrometer. Multidimensional protein iden-\ntification technology (MudPIT) employs successive rounds\nof chromatography to resolve the peptides produced from the\ndigestion of a complex biologic sample into several simpler\nfractions that can be analyzed separately by MS.\nToday, advances in the capability and sensitivity of tandem\nmass spectrometers allow them to directly analyze complex\nsamples. The elimination of prior proteolytic or chromato-\ngraphic preparation will soon render it feasible to analyze the\nproteome of an individual cell.\nBioinformatics Assists Identification\nof \nProtein Functions\nThe functions of a large proportion of the proteins encoded by\nthe\n human genome are presently unknown. Efforts continue to\ndevelop protein arrays or chips for directly testing the poten-\ntial functions of proteins on a mass scale. However, while some\nprotein functions are relatively easy to assay, such as protease\nor esterase activity, others are much less tractable. Data mining\nvia bioinformatics permits researchers to compare amino acid\nsequences of unknown proteins with those whose functions\nhave been determined. This provides a means to uncover clues\nto their potential properties, physiologic roles, and mechanisms\nof action. Algorithms exploit the tendency of nature to employ\nvariations of a structural theme to perform similar functions in\nseveral proteins (eg, the Rossmann nucleotide binding fold to\nbind NAD(P)H, nuclear targeting sequences, and EF hands to\nbind Ca2+). These domains generally are detected in the primary\nstr\nucture by conservation of particular amino acids at key posi-\ntions. Insights into the properties and physiologic role of a newly\ndiscovered protein thus may be inferred by comparing its pri-\nmary structure with that of known proteins.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Long amino acid polymers or polypeptides constitute the\nbasic structural u\nnit of proteins, and the structure of a protein\nprovides insights into how it fulfills its functions.\n\u25a0Proteins undergo posttranslational alterations during their\nlifetime tha\nt influence their function and determine their fate.\n\u25a0By generating a new amino terminus, Edman reagent permitted\nthe determina\ntion of lengthy segments of amino acid sequence.\nHowever, physical and chemical factors generally limited the\nnumber of amino acids that could be reliably identified to 30 or\nless, which rendered the complete determination of a protein\u2019s\nsequence via the Edman technique a time- and effort- intensive\nprocess.\n\u25a0Polyacrylamide gels provide a porous matrix for separating\npro\nteins on the basis of their mobility in an applied direct\ncurrent electrical field."

Other cova-\nlent modifications may add new chemical functionalities to a\nprotein. The maturation of collagen illustrates both of these\nprocesses.\nCollagen Is a Fibrous Protein\nThe fibrous proteins collagen, keratin, and myosin account\nfor\n more than 25% of the protein mass in the human body.\nThese fibrous proteins represent a primary source of struc-\ntural strength for cells (ie, the cytoskeleton) and tissues (eg, the\nextracellular matrix). Skin derives its strength and flexibility\nfrom an intertwined mesh of collagen and keratin fibers, while\nbones and teeth are buttressed by an underlying network of col-\nlagen fibers analogous to steel strands in reinforced concrete.\nCollagen also is present in connective tissues such as ligaments\nand tendons. The high degree of tensile strength required to\nfulfill these structural roles derives from collagen\u2019s elongated\nform and high degree of crosslinking.\nCollagen Forms a Unique Triple Helix\nA mature collagen fiber forms an elongated rod with an axial\nratio \nof about 200. Each fiber is comprised of three intertwined\npolypeptide strands, which twist to the left, wrapping around\none another in a right-handed fashion to form the unique col-\nlagen triple helix ( Figure 5\u201311 ). The opposing handedness of\nthis superhelix and its component polypeptides makes the col-\nlagen triple helix highly resistant to unwinding\u2014a principle\nalso applied to the steel cables of suspension bridges. A collagen\ntriple helix has 3.3 residues per turn and a rise per residue nearly\ntwice that of an \u03b1 helix. The R groups of each polypeptide strand\nof the triple helix pack so closely that, in order to fit, one of the\nthree must be H. Thus, every third amino acid residue in colla-\ngen is a glycine residue. Staggering of the three strands provides\nappropriate positioning of the requisite glycines throughout the\nhelix. Collagen is also rich in proline and hydroxyproline, yield-\ning a repetitive Gly-X-Y pattern (see Figure 5\u201311) in which Y\ngenerally is proline or hydroxyproline.\nCollagen triple helices are stabilized by hydrogen bonds\nbetween residues in different polypeptide chains, a process\nhelped by the hydroxyl groups of hydroxyprolyl residues.\nAdditional stability is provided by covalent cross-links formed\nbetween modified lysyl residues both within and between\npolypeptide chains.Collagen Is Synthesized as a Larger\nPrecursor\nCollagen is initially synthesized as a larger precursor poly-\npeptide, \nprocollagen. Numerous prolyl and lysyl residues of\nprocollagen are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl\nhydroxylase, enzymes that require ascorbic acid (vitamin C;\nsee Chapters 27 and 44). Hydroxyprolyl and hydroxylysyl\nresidues provide additional hydrogen-bonding capability that\nstabilizes the mature protein. In addition, glucosyl and galac-\ntosyl transferases attach glucosyl or galactosyl residues to the\nhydroxyl groups of specific hydroxylysyl residues.\nThe central portion of the precursor polypeptide then\nassociates with other molecules to form the characteristic\ntriple helix. This process is accompanied by the removal of\nthe globular amino terminal and carboxyl terminal exten-\nsions of the precursor polypeptide by selective proteolysis.\nCertain lysyl residues are modified by lysyl oxidase, a copper-\ncontaining protein that converts \u03b5-amino groups to aldehydes.\nThe aldehydes can either undergo an aldol condensation to\nform a C\u2014 \u2014C double bond or form a Schiff base (eneimine)\nwith the \u03b5-amino group of an unmodified lysyl residue, which is\nsubsequently reduced to form a C\u2014N single bond. These cova-\nlent bonds cross-link the individual polypeptides and imbue the\nfiber with exceptional strength and rigidity.\nNutritional & Genetic Disorders Can\nImpair \nCollagen Maturation\nThe complex series of events in collagen maturation illustrate\nthe consequences of incomplet\ne polypeptide maturation. The\nbest-known defect in collagen biosynthesis is scurvy , which\nresults from a dietary deficiency of the vitamin C required by\nprolyl and lysyl hydroxylases. The consequent deficit in the\nnumber of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine residues under-\nmines the conformational stability of collagen fibers, leading\nto bleeding gums, swelling joints, poor wound healing, and\nultimately death. Menkes syndrome , characterized by kinky\nhair and growth retardation, is brought on by a dietary defi-\nciency of the copper required by lysyl oxidase, which catalyzes\na key step in the formation of the covalent cross-links that\nstrengthen collagen fibers.\nGenetic disorders of collagen biosynthesis include sev-\neral forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, characterized by fragile\nbones. In the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of connective\ntissue disorders that involve impaired integrity of support-\ning structures, defects in the genes that encode \u03b1 collagen-1,\nprocollagen N-peptidase, or lysyl hydroxylase result in mobile\njoints and skin abnormalities (see Chapter 50).\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Proteins may be classified based on their solubility, shape,\nor \nfunction or on the presence of a prosthetic group, such as\nheme.\n\u25a0The gene-encoded primary structure of a polypeptide is the\nsequence o\nf its amino acids.

However, they may di\ue040\ue040er in the way\nthis is achieved. While the sequence o\ue040 chemical steps at the active\nsite parallels those which occur when the substrates react in the\nabsence o\ue040 a catalyst, the environment of the active site low-\ners \u0394 GFb y stabilizing the transition state intermediates. \ue035 o put\nit another way, the enzyme can be envisioned as binding to the\ntransition state intermediate (Figure 8\u20131) more tightly than it does\nto either substrates or products. As discussed in Chapter 7, sta-\nbilization can involve (1) acid\u2013base groups suitably positioned to\ntrans\ue040er protons to or \ue040rom the developing transition state inter-\nmediate, (2) suitably positioned charged groups or metal ions that\nstabilize developing charges, or (3) the imposition o\ue040 steric strain\non substrates so that their geometry approaches that o\ue040 the transi-\ntion state. HIV protease (see Figure 7\u20136) illustrates catalysis by an\nenzyme that lowers the activation barrier in part by stabilizing a\ntransition state intermediate.\nCatalysis by enzymes that proceeds via a unique reaction\nmechanism typically occurs when the transition state inter-\nmediate \ue040orms a covalent bond with the enzyme (covalent\ncatalysis) . \ue035he catalytic mechanism o\ue040 the serine protease chy-\nmotrypsin (see Figure 7\u20137) illustrates how an enzyme utilizes\ncovalent catalysis to provide a unique reaction pathway pos-\nsessing a more \ue040avorable Eact.\nENZYMES DO NOT AFFECT Keq\nWhile enzymes undergo transient modi\ue040ications during the pro-\nce\nss o\ue040 catalysis, they always emerge unchanged at the comple-\ntion o\ue040 the reaction. The presence of an enzyme therefore has\nno effect on \u0394 G0fo r the overall reaction , which is a \ue040unction\nsolely o\ue040 the initial and final states o\ue040 the reactants.

However,\nheat energy can also increase the con\ue040ormational \ue040lexing o\ue040 the\nenzyme to a point that exceeds the energy barrier \ue040or disrupting\nthe noncovalent interactions that maintain its three-dimensional\nstructure. \ue035he polypeptide chain then begins to un\ue040old, or dena-\nture, with an accompanying loss o\ue040 the catalytic activity. \ue035he\ntemperature range over which an enzyme maintains a stable,\ncatalytically competent con\ue040ormation depends on\u2014and typi-\ncally moderately exceeds\u2014the normal temperature o\ue040 the cells\nin which it resides. Enzymes \ue040rom humans generally exhibit sta-\nbility at temperatures up to 45 to 55\u00b0C. By contrast, enzymes\n\ue040rom the thermophilic microorganisms that reside in volcanic\nhot springs or undersea hydrothermal vents may be stable at\ntemperatures up to or even above 100\u00b0C.\n\ue035hetemperature coefficient (Q10)is the \ue040actor by which the\nrate o\ue040 a biologic process increases \ue040or a 10\u00b0C increase in tem-\nperature. For the temperatures over which enzymes are stable,\nthe rates o\ue040 most biologic processes typically double \ue040or a 10\u00b0C\nrise in temperature (Q10= 2). Chan ges in the rates o\ue040 enzyme-\ncatalyzed reactions that accompany a rise or \ue040all in body temper-\nature constitute a prominent survival \ue040eature \ue040or \u201ccold-blooded\u201d\nli\ue040e \ue040orms such as lizards or \ue040ish, whose body temperatures are\ndictated by the external environment.

For enzymes with mul-\ntiple substrates, the principles discussed below apply with equal\nvalidity. Moreover, by employing pseudo-\ue040irst-order conditions(see above), scientists can study the dependence o\ue040 reaction rate\non an individual reactant through the appropriate choice o\ue040 \ue040ixed\nand variable substrates. In other words, under pseudo-\ue040irst-\norder conditions the behavior o\ue040 a multisubstrate enzyme will\nimitate one having a single substrate. In this instance, however,\nthe observed rate constant will be a \ue040unction both o\ue040 the rate\nconstant k1\ue040o r the reaction and o\ue040 the concentration o\ue040 the \ue040ixed\nsubstrate.\nFor a typical enzyme, as substrate concentration is increased,\nviin creases until it reaches a maximum value Vmax(Fi gure 8\u20134 ).\nWhen \ue040urther increases in substrate concentration \ue040ail to increase\nvi, the enzyme is said to be \u201csaturated\u201d with the substrate.

At any given instant, only\nsubstrate molecules that are combined with the enzyme as an\nenzyme-substrate (ES) complex can be trans\ue040ormed into product.\nSince the equilibrium constant \ue040or the \ue040ormation o\ue040 the enzyme-\nsubstrate complex is not in\ue040initely large, only a \ue040raction o\ue040\nthe enzyme may be present as an ES complex even when the\nsubstrate is present in considerable excess (points A and B o\ue040\nFigure 8\u20135 ). At points A or B, increasing or decreasing [S] there-\n\ue040ore will increase or decrease the number o\ue040 ES complexes with\na corresponding change in vi. At point C (Figure 8\u20135), however,\nes\nsentially all the enzyme is present as the ES complex. Since no\n\ue040ree enzyme remains available \ue040or \ue040orming ES, \ue040urther increases\nin [S] cannot increase the rate o\ue040 the reaction.

He observed that\nliving organisms respond in ways that are both quantitatively\nand temporally appropriate to permit them to survive the\nmultiple challenges posed by changes in their external and\ninternal environments. Walter Cannon subsequently coined\nthe term \u201chomeostasis\u201d to describe the ability of animals to\nmaintain a constant internal environment despite changes in\ntheir external surroundings. At the cellular level, homeostasis\nis maintained by adjusting the rates of key metabolic reactions\nin response to internal changes by monitoring the levels of key\nmetabolic intermediates, such as 5 \u2032-AMP and NAD+, or to\nexternal factor\ns such as hormones through receptor-mediated\nsignal transduction cascades.\nPerturbations of the sensor-response machinery respon-\nsible for maintaining homeostatic balance can be deleteri-\nous to human health. Cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and\nAlzheimer disease, for example, are all characterized by\nregulatory dysfunctions triggered by the interplay betweenpathogenic agents, genetic mutations, nutritional inputs, and\nlifestyle practices. Many oncogenic viruses contribute to the\ninitiation of cancer by elaborating protein-tyrosine kinases\nthat modify proteins responsible for controlling patterns of\ngene expression. The cholera toxin produced by Vibrio cholerae\ndisables sensor-response pathways in intestinal epithelial\ncells by catalyzing the addition of ADP-ribose to the GTP-\nbinding proteins (G-proteins) that link cell-surface receptors\nto adenylyl cyclase. The ADP-ribosylation induced activation\nof the cyclase leads to the unrestricted flow of water into the\nintestines, resulting in massive diarrhea and dehydration.\nYersinia pestis , the causative agent of plague, elaborates a pro-\ntein-tyrosine phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphoryl groups\non key cytoskeletal proteins, thereby disabling the phagocytic\nmachinery of protective macrophages.

Such DNA-independent hereditary\ninformation is referred to as epigenetic . This chapter outlines\nthe mechanisms by which metabolic processes are controlled,\nand provides some illustrative examples.\nREGULATION OF METABOLITE\nFL\nOW CAN BE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE\nWhile at first it might seem desirable to have metabolic\nenzymes \nnormally operate at their maximal rate, this leaves\nlittle room to adjust throughput or flux to changes in substrate\navailability. When an enzyme is saturated by substrate, the\nrate of product formation cannot increase to accommodate a\nsurge in substrate availability (see Figure 9\u20131). Moreover, even\nrelatively large decreases in substrate availability will produce\nonly disproportionately small decreases in rate. Consequently,\nmost enzymes have evolved such that their Kmvalues for\nsubstrates tend to be close to the latter\u2019s average intracellular\nconcentrations, so that changes in substrate concentration gen-\nerate corresponding changes in metabolite flux ( Figure 9\u20131 ).\nResponses to changes in substrate level represent an important\nbutpassive means for the intercellular coordination of metab-\nolite flow. Adaptation to extracellular signals requires mecha-\nnisms for regulating enzyme efficiency in an active manner.Metabolite Flow Tends to Be\nUnidirectional\nNormally, living cells exist in a dynamic steady state in which\nthe \nmean concentrations of metabolic intermediates remain\nrelatively constant over time. This reflects the fact that, in living\ncells, the reaction products of one enzyme-catalyzed reaction\nserve as substrates for, and are rapidly removed by, other enzyme-\ncatalyzed reactions ( Figure 9\u20132 ). Under these circumstances\nflux through many nominally reversible enzyme-catalyzed\nreactions occurs unidirectionally. In a pathway comprised of a\nsuccession of coupled enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the continual\ndepletion of the pathway intermediates pulls the equilibrium\nfor even those reactions characterized by small or even slightly\nunfavorable changes in free energy in favor of product for-\nmation, because the overall change in free energy that favors\nunidirectional metabolite flow. This situation is somewhat\nanalogous to the flow of water through a pipe in which one\nend is lower than the other. Flow of water through the pipe\nremains unidirectional despite the presence of bends or kinks,\ndue to the overall change in height, which corresponds to the\npathway\u2019s overall change in free energy ( Figure 9\u20133 ).\nCOMPARTMENTATION ENSURES\nMET\nABOLIC EFFICIENCY\n& SIMPLIFIES REGULATION\nIn eukaryotes, the anabolic and catabolic pathways that syn-\nthe\nsize and break down common biomolecules often are\nphysically separated from one another. Certain metabolic\npathways reside only within specialized cell types or inside\nseparate subcellular compartments. For example, fatty acid\nbiosynthesis occurs in the cytosol, whereas fatty acid oxida-\ntion takes place within mitochondria (see Chapters 22 and 23),\nwhile many degradative enzymes are contained inside organ-\nelles called lysosomes. In addition, apparently antagonistic\npathways can coexist in the absence of physical barriers pro-\nvided that each proceeds with the formation of one or more\nunique intermediates . For any reaction or series of reactions,\nthe change in free energy that takes place when metaboliteFIGURE 9\u20131 Differential response of the rate of an enzyme-\ncatalyzed \nreaction, \u0394 V, to the same incremental change in sub-\nstrate concentration at a substrate concentration close to Km(\u0394VA)\nor \nfar above Km(\u0394VB).\nNutrients  WastesSmall\nmoleculesSmall\nmolecules\nSmall\nmoleculesLarge\nmolecules\n~P ~P\nFIGURE 9\u20132 An idealized cell in steady state.

Some enzymes within these pathways\ncatalyze reactions, such as isomerizations, for which the dif-\nference in free energy between substrates and products is\nclose to zero. These catalysts act bidirectionally, depending\non the ratio of substrates to products. However, virtually\nall metabolic pathways possess one or more steps for which\n\u0394Gis significant. For example, glycolysis, the breakdown of\nglucose to form two molecules of pyruvate, has a favorable\noverall \u0394 Gof \u221296 kJ/mol, a value much too large to simply\noperate in \u201creverse\u201d in order to convert excess pyruvate to\nglucose. Consequently, gluconeogenesis proceeds via a path-\nway in which the three most energetically disfavored steps\nin glycolysis are circumvented using alternative, thermody-\nnamically favorable reactions catalyzed by distinct enzymes\n(see Chapter 19).\nThe ability of enzymes to discriminate between the struc-\nturally similar coenzymes NAD+and N ADP+also results in a\nform of compartmentation. The reduction potentials of both\ncoenzymes are similar. However, most of the reactions that\ngenerate electrons destined for the electron transport chain\nreduce NAD+to NADH, while enzymes that catalyze the\nreductive steps in many biosynthetic pathways generally use\nNADPH as the electron donor.\nRate-Limiting Enzymes as Preferred\nT\nargets of Regulatory Control\nWhile the flux of metabolites through metabolic pathways\ninvo\nlves catalysis by numerous enzymes, homeostasis is\nmaintained by the regulation of only a select subset of these\nenzymes. The ideal enzyme for regulatory intervention is one\nwhose quantity or catalytic efficiency dictates that the reac-\ntion it catalyzes is slow relative to all others in the pathway.\nDecreasing the catalytic efficiency or the quantity of the cata-\nlyst participating in the \u201cbottleneck\u201d or rate-limiting reaction\nwill immediately reduce metabolite flux through the entire\npathway. Conversely, an increase in either its quantity or cata-\nlytic efficiency will elicit an increase in flux through the path-\nway as a whole. As natural \u201cgovernors\u201d of metabolic flux, the\nenzymes that catalyze rate-limiting steps also constitute prom-\nising drug targets. For example, \u201cstatin\u201d drugs curtail synthesis\nof cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, catalyst of\nthe rate-limiting reaction of cholesterogenesis.\nREGULATION OF ENZYME\nQUANTITY\nThe overall catalytic capacity of the rate-limiting step in a met-\nabolic path\nway is the product of the concentration of enzyme\nmolecules and their intrinsic catalytic efficiency. It therefore\nfollows that catalytic capacity can be controlled by changing\nthe quantity of enzyme present, altering its intrinsic catalytic\nefficiency, or a combination thereof.Proteins Are Continuously Synthesized\n& \nDegraded\nBy measuring the rates of incorporation and subsequent loss of\n15N-labeled amino acids into proteins, Schoenheimer deduced\nthat \nproteins exist in a state of \u201cdynamic equilibrium\u201d where\nthey are continuously synthesized and degraded\u2014a process\nreferred to as protein turnover . Even constitutive proteins,\nthose whose aggregate concentrations remain essentially con-\nstant over time, are subject to continual replacement through\nturnover. However, the concentrations of many other enzymes\nare subject to dynamic shifts in response to hormonal, dietary,\npathologic, and other factors that may affect the overall rate\nconstants for their synthesis ( ks), degradation ( kdeg), or both.\nEnzyme\nAmino acidsks kdeg\nControl of Enzyme Synthesis\nThe synthesis of certain enzymes depends on the presence\nofind\nucers , typically substrates or structurally related com-\npounds that stimulate the transcription of the gene that encodes\nthem (see Chapter 38), or transcription factors .Escherichia\ncoligrown on glucose will, for example, only catabolize lac-\ntose after addition of a \u03b2-galactoside, an inducer that triggers\nsynthesis of a \u03b2-galactosidase and a galactoside permease.\nInducible enzymes of humans include tryptophan pyrrolase,\nthreonine dehydratase, tyrosine-\u03b1-ketoglutarate aminotrans-\nferase, enzymes of the urea cycle, HMG-CoA reductase,\n\u0394-aminolevulinate synthase, and cytochrome P450. Con-\nversely, an excess of a metabolite may curtail synthesis of its\ncognate enzyme via repression . Both induction and repres-\nsion involve ciselements, specific DNA sequences located\nupstream of regulated genes, that provide binding sites for\ntrans -acting regulatory proteins. The molecular mechanisms\nof induction and repression are discussed in Chapter 38, while\ndetailed information on the control of protein synthesis in\nresponse to hormonal stimuli can be found in Chapter 42.\nControl of Enzyme Degradation\nIn animals many proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-\npro\nteasome pathway. Degradation takes place in the 26S pro-\nteasome, a large macromolecular complex made up of more\nthan 30 polypeptide subunits arranged in the form of a hollow\ncylinder. The active sites of its proteolytic subunits face the\ninterior of the cylinder, thus preventing indiscriminate degra-\ndation of cellular proteins. Proteins are targeted to the interior\nof the proteasome by the covalent attachment of one or more\nmolecules of ubiquitin, a small, 76 amino acid (\u2248 8.5-kDa),\nprotein that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. \u201cUbiqui-\ntination\u201d is catalyzed by a large family of enzymes called E3\nligases, which attach ubiquitin to the side-chain amino group\nof lysyl residues on their targets."

The key to the versatility\nand selectivity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system resides in\nthe variety of intracellular E3 ligases and their ability to dis-\ncriminate between the different physical or conformational\nstates of target proteins. Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome path-\nway can selectively degrade proteins whose physical integrity\nand functional competency have been compromised by the loss\nof or damage to a prosthetic group, oxidation of cysteine or his-\ntidine residues, partial unfolding, or deamidation of asparagine\nor glutamine residues (see Chapter 57). Recognition by proteo-\nlytic enzymes also can be regulated by covalent modifications\nsuch as phosphorylation; binding of substrates or allosteric\neffectors; or association with membranes, oligonucleotides, or\nother proteins. Dysfunctions of the ubiquitin-proteasome path-\nway sometimes contribute to the accumulation and subsequent\naggregation of misfolded proteins characteristic of several neu-\nrodegenerative diseases.\nMULTIPLE OPTIONS ARE\nA\nVAILABLE FOR REGULATING\nCATALYTIC ACTIVITY\nIn humans the induction of protein synthesis is a complex\nmultis\ntep process that typically requires hours to produce sig-\nnificant changes in overall enzyme level. By contrast, changes\nin intrinsic catalytic efficiency triggered by binding of disso-\nciable ligands ( allosteric regulation ) or by covalent modifi-\ncation occur within a few minutes to a fraction of a second.\nConsequently, changes in protein level generally dominate\nwhen meeting long-term adaptive requirements, whereas\nchanges in catalytic efficiency are favored for rapid and tran-\nsient alterations in metabolite flux.\nALLOSTERIC EFFECTORS\nREGULA\nTE CERTAIN ENZYMES\nThe activity of many enzymes is regulated by the noncova-\nlent \nbinding of small molecules known as effectors . Effec-\ntor binding can modulate enzyme function by virtue of the\nfact that the enzyme\u2013effector complex is a distinct molecular\nentity from the individual enzyme and effector molecules, and\nthus can manifest properties different than those of its sepa-\nrated components. Effector binding can increase (activate) or\ndecrease (inhibit) the catalytic efficiency of the target enzyme,\ncause it to translocate to a different location within a cell, trig-\nger its association with (or dissociation) from other proteins,\nor even potentiate or suppress sensitivity to the binding of a\nsecond effector or to covalent modification. Physiologic effec-\ntors include several of the end products and intermediates of\nkey metabolic pathways, as well as specialized biomolecules\nwhose sole function is to act as regulatory ligands.Most effectors bear little or no resemblance to the substrates\nor products of the affected enzyme. For example an effector of\n3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, the amino acid serine, dis-\nplays minimal structural overlap with either of the enzyme\u2019s\nsubstrates, 3-phosphoglycerate and NAD+(Figur e 9\u20134 ).\nJacques Monod reasoned that the lack of structural similarity\nbetween most physiologic effectors and the reactants targeted\nfor catalytic transformation by their cognate enzymes indi-\ncated that these modulators bound at a site that was physically\ndistinct and perhaps even physically distant from an enzyme\u2019s\nactive site. Monod employed the term allosteric , which means\nto \u201coccupy another space, \u201d to classify these modulatory sites\nas well as the effectors that are bound to them. The ability of\nallosteric ligands to influence events taking place at the active\nsite can be attributed to their ability to induce conformational\nchanges that affect all or large portions on an enzyme. Allosteric\neffectors may influence catalytic efficiency by altering the Km\nfor \na substrate (K series allosteric enzymes), Vmax(V -series\nallosteric enzymes), or both.\nAllosteric Effectors Can Be Grouped\nInto \nThree Functional Classes\nAllosteric effectors can be classified into three categories based\non \ntheir origin and scope of action. Feedback effectors are path-\nway end products or intermediates that bind to and either\nactivate or inhibit one or more enzymes within the pathway\nresponsible for their synthesis. In most cases, feedback inhibi-\ntors bind to the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step\nin a particular biosynthetic sequence. In the following exam-\nple, the biosynthesis of D from A is catalyzed by enzymes Enz1\nthrough \nEnz3:\nEnz1Enz2Enz3\nA\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\nIn \nthe case of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, serine is the\nend product of a pathway for which this enzyme catalyzes the\nfirst committed step (see Figure 9\u20134).\nThe regulatory function of feedback effectors is secondary\nin importance to their role metabolism. Their scope of action\nis also localized to the pathway responsible for their synthesis.\nIn most cases, the binding of an end product or intermediate\ndecreases the catalytic efficiency of their enzyme target, a pat-\ntern called feedback inhibition.\nLike feedback effectors, indicator metabolites also are met-\nabolic end products or intermediates with a secondary role as\nallosteric effectors of enzymes. They are distinguished from\nfeedback effectors by their scope of action, which extends\nbeyond or even lies outside of their pathway of origin. This\nenables indicator metabolites to coordinate flux through\nmultiple metabolic pathways. For example, citrate\u2014a key\nintermediate in the citric acid cycle (Chapter 16)\u2014acts as\nan allosteric activator of the enzyme responsible for catalyz-\ning the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis, acetyl-\nCoA carboxylase (see Figure 23\u20136), while alanine acts as an"

CTP , an end product of the pyrimidine biosynthetic\npathway, functions as a feedback inhibitor of ATCase, whereas\nthe purine nucleotide ATP activates it. Moreover, the bind-\ning of ATP prevents inhibition by CTP , enabling synthesis of\npyrimidine nucleotides to proceed when purine nucleotide lev-\nels are elevated. The ability of the indicator metabolite ATP to\nprevent momentary interruptions arising from momentary,\ntransient increases in the level of the inhibitory effector CTP\nensures that pyrimidine biosynthesis keeps pace with purine\nbiosynthesis during times of high demand, such as when DNA\nreplication takes place.\nREGULATORY COVALENT\nMODIFICA\nTIONS CAN BE\nREVERSIBLE OR IRREVERSIBLE\nMammalian proteins are the targets of a wide range of cova-\nlent \nmodification processes. Modifications such as prenyl-\nation, glycosylation, hydroxylation, and fatty acid acylation\nintroduce unique structural features into newly synthesized\nproteins that persist for the lifetime of the protein. Some cova-\nlent modifications regulate protein function. The core prin-\nciple underlying regulatory covalent modification is that,\nintroducing a new covalent bond or cleaving an existing\ncovalent bond alters the identity of the affected enzyme. This\n\u201cnew\u201d enzyme molecule thus can possess properties distinct\nfrom those of its precursor. In mammalian cells, a wide range\nof regulatory covalent modifications occur. Some of these\nmodifications, such as partial proteolysis , in which one or a\nsmall handful of peptide bonds within a precursor protein\nare hydrolyzed, are termed irreversible because it is impossi-\nble to reconstruct the precursor form of the protein inside the\ncell. Hence, once modified the activated proteins retain their\nnew form and properties until they are damaged, disposed, or\ndegraded.\nAcetylation, ADP-ribosylation, sumoylation (the attach-\nment of a small, ubiquitin-like modifier or SUMO protein),\nand phosphorylation are all examples of so-called reversible\ncovalent modifications. In this context, \u201creversible\u201d refers to\ncapability to restore the modified protein to its modification-\nfree precursor form and notthe mechanism by which res-\ntoration takes place. Thermodynamics dictates that if the\nenzyme-catalyzed reaction by which the modification was\nintroduced is thermodynamically favorable, simply reversing\nthe process will be rendered impractical by the correspond-\ningly unfavorable free-energy change. The phosphorylation ofproteins on seryl, threonyl, or tyrosyl residues, catalyzed by\nprotein kinases, is thermodynamically favored as a conse-\nquence of utilizing the high-energy gamma phosphoryl group\nof ATP . Phosphate groups are removed, not by recombining\nthe phosphate with ADP to form ATP , but by a hydrolytic\nreaction catalyzed by enzymes called protein phosphatases.\nSimilarly, acetyltransferases employ a high-energy donor sub-\nstrate, NAD+, while deacetylases catalyze a direct hydrolysis\nthat \ngenerates free acetate.\nActivation of Chymotrypsin Illustrates\nContr\nol of Enzyme Activity by Selective\nProteolysis\nMany secreted proteins are synthesized as larger, functionally\ninert \nprecursors called proproteins . If the latent function of the\nproprotein is catalytic in nature, these precursors are termed\nproenzymes or, alternatively, zymogens . Transformation of\nproproteins into their active, functionally competent forms is\naccomplished by selective, also known as partial, proteolysis\ninvolving one or a small handful of highly specific proteolytic\nclips. Activation of chymotrypsinogen, for example, involves\nthe hydrolysis of four peptide bonds ( Figure 9\u20136 ) that divide\nthe original polypeptide into five smaller segments. The larg-\nest of these are designated as peptides A, B, and C. In mature,\nactive \u03b1-chymotrypsin the A, B, and C peptides are linked\ntogether by disulfide bonds while the two small dipeptides\nare allowed to diffuse away. Note that while residues His 57\nand Asp 102 of the catalytically essential charge relay network\n(see Figure 7\u20137) reside on the B peptide, Ser 195 resides on\nthe C peptide, brought together in three-dimensional space by\nconformational changes triggered by the partial proteolysis of\nchymotrypsinogen.\nMany Digestive Enzymes Are Stored as\nFu\nnctionally Dormant Proproteins\nIn their zymogen form, digestive proteases and lipases can\nbe \nsafely stored in the pancreas as they await their excretion\ninto the stomach. On secretion into the digestive tract, these\npancreatic hydrolases become activated by a series of selec-\ntive proteolytic cleavages that are initiated by the conversion\nof trypsinogen to trypsin through the proteolytic action of\nenteropeptidase , formerly known as enterokinase, a protease\nfound in the brush border of the duodenum. Once activated by\nenteropeptidase, trypsin catalyzes the subsequent conversion\nof numerous other pancreatic zymogens such as chymotryp-\nsinogen, proelastase, kallikreinogen, procarboxypeptidases A\nand B, prophospholipase A2, and pancreatic prolipase.\nPepsinogen, which is secreted by gastric chief cells, cata-\nlyzes its own activation to pepsin. Autoproteolysis is triggered\nby conformational changes induced on exposure to the acidic\npH of upper gastrointestinal tract. In pancreatitis, premature\nactivation of digestive proteases and lipases leads to autodiges-\ntion of healthy tissue rather than ingested proteins."

These modifications modulate\nthe manner in which the proteins within chromatin inter-\nact with each other as well as the DNA itself. The resulting\nchanges in chromatin structure within the region affected can\nrender genes more accessible to the proteins responsible for\ntheir transcription, thereby enhancing gene expression or,\non a larger scale, facilitating replication of the entire genome\n(see Chapter 38). On the other hand, changes in chromatin\nstructure that restrict the accessibility of genes to transcrip-\ntion factors, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, etc., thereby\ninhibiting transcription, are said to silence gene expression.\nThe combination of covalent modifications that determine\ngene accessibility in chromatin has been termed the \u201chistone\ncode. \u201d This code represents a classic example of epigenetics ,\nthe hereditary transmission of information by the means other\nthan the sequence of nucleotides that comprise the genome.\nIn this instance, the pattern of gene expression within a newly\nformed \u201cdaughter\u201d cell will be determined, in part, by the par-\nticular set of histone covalent modifications embodied in the\nchromatin proteins inherited from the \u201cparental\u201d cell.\nThousands of Mammalian Proteins Are\nModified \nby Covalent Phosphorylation\nProtein kinases phospho rylate proteins by catalyzing trans-\nfer of the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the hydroxyl\ngroups of select seryl, threonyl, or tyrosyl residues in proteins,\nforming O-phosphoseryl, O-phosphothreonyl, or O-phospho-\ntyrosyl residues, respectively ( Figure 9\u20137 ). The unmodified\nform of the protein can be regenerated by hydrolytic removal\nof phosphoryl groups, a thermodynamically favorable reac-\ntion catalyzed by protein phosphatases .\nA typical mammalian cell possesses thousands of phos-\nphorylated proteins and several hundred protein kinases and\nprotein phosphatases that catalyze their interconversion. The\nease of interconversion of enzymes between their phospho\nand dephospho forms accounts, in part, for the frequency\nwith which phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation is utilized as\na mechanism for regulatory control. Unlike structural modifi-\ncations, covalent phosphorylation persists only as long as the\ncovalently modified form of the protein serves a specific need.\nOnce the need has passed, the enzyme can be converted back\nto its original form, poised to respond to the next stimulatory\nevent. A second factor underlying the widespread use of pro-\ntein phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation lies in the chemicalproperties of the phosphoryl group itself. In order to alter an\nenzyme\u2019s functional properties, modifications to its chemical\nstructure must influence the protein\u2019s three-dimensional con-\nfiguration. The high-charge density of protein-bound phos-\nphoryl groups, \u22121 or \u22122 at physiologic pH, their propensity\nto form strong salt bridges with arginyl and lysyl residues, and\ntheir high exceptionally high hydrogen-bonding capacity ren-\nders them potent agents for modifying protein structure and\nfunction. Phosphorylation generally influences an enzyme\u2019s\nintrinsic catalytic efficiency or other properties by inducing\nchanges in its conformation. Consequently, the amino acids\nmodified by phosphorylation can be and typically are rela-\ntively distant from the catalytic site itself.\nProtein Acetylation: A Ubiquitous\nModification \nof Metabolic Enzymes\nAs is the case with covalent phosphorylation, covalent acetyla-\ntion \npossesses the twin virtues of employing the conformation\naltering potential of changing the charge character of the side\nchain which they target, in this case from the +1 of the pro-\ntonated \u03b5-amino group of lysine to neutral acetylated form,\nand being reversible in vivo. It is thus not surprising that\nthe number of proteins subject to and regulated by covalent\nacetylation\u2013deacetylation now numbers in the thousands.\nThese include histones and other nuclear proteins as well as\nnearly every enzyme in such core metabolic pathways as gly-\ncolysis, glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic\nacid cycle, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, and the urea cycle.

Their degree of acetylation thus is thought to\nrespond to and reflect changes in the concentration of this cen-\ntral metabolic intermediate. The acetylation of other proteins,\nparticularly those residing outside the mitochondria, requires\nthe intervention of a lysine acetyltransferase . These enzymes\ncatalyze the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to the\n\u03b5-amino groups of lysyl residues, forming N-acetyl lysine.\nAll protein deacetylation is believed to be enzyme cata-\nlyzed. Two classes of protein deacetylases have been identified:\nhistone deacetylases andsirtuins . Histone deacetylases cata-\nlyze the removal by hydrolysis of acetyl groups, regenerating\nthe unmodified form of the protein and acetate as products.\nSirtuins, on the other hand, use NAD+as substrate, which\nyields O-acetyl ADP-ribose and nicotinamide as products in\naddition to the unmodified protein.\nCovalent Modifications Regulate\nMetabolite \nFlow\nIn many respects, the sites of protein phosphorylation, acety-\nla\ntion, and other covalent modifications can be considered\nanother form of allosteric site. However, in this case, the \u201callo-\nsteric ligand\u201d binds covalently to the protein. Phosphorylation\u2013\ndephosphorylation, acetylation\u2013deacetylation, and feedback\ninhibition provide short-term, readily reversible regulation of\nmetabolite flow in response to specific physiologic signals.\nAll three act independently of changes in gene expression. As\nwith feedback inhibition, protein phosphorylation\u2013dephos-\nphorylation generally targets an early enzyme in a protracted\nmetabolic pathway. Feedback inhibition involves a single pro-\ntein that is influenced indirectly, if at all, by hormonal or neu-\nral signals. By contrast, regulation of mammalian enzymes by\nphosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation involves one or more pro-\ntein kinases and protein phosphatases, and is generally under\ndirect neural and hormonal control.\nAcetylation\u2013deacetylation, on the other hand, targets mul-\ntiple proteins in a pathway. It has been hypothesized that the\ndegree of acetylation of metabolic enzymes is modulated to a\nlarge degree by the energy status of the cell. Under this model,\nthe high levels of acetyl-CoA (the substrate for lysine acet-\nyltransferases and the reactant in nonenzymatic lysine acetyla-\ntion) present in a well-nourished cell would promote lysine\nacetylation. When nutrients are lacking, acetyl-CoA levels\ndrop and the ratio of NAD+/NADH rises, favoring protein\ndea\ncetylation.\nPROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION IS\nEXTREMEL\nY VERSATILE\nProtein phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation is a highly versa-\ntile and selective pr\nocess. Not all proteins are subject to phos-\nphorylation, and of the many hydroxyl groups on a protein\u2019ssurface, only one or a small subset are targeted. While phosphory-\nlation of some enzymes increases their catalytic activity, the phos-\nphorylated form of other enzymes may be catalytically inactive\n(Table 9\u20131 ). Alternatively, phosphorylation may affect a protein\u2019s\nlocation within the cell, susceptibility to proteolytic degradation,\nresponsiveness to regulation by allosteric ligands, or responsive-\nness to covalent modification on some other site.\nMany proteins can be phosphorylated at multiple sites.\nOthers are subject to regulation both by phosphorylation\u2013\ndephosphorylation and by the binding of allosteric ligands, or\nby phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation and another covalent\nmodification. If the protein kinase that phosphorylates a par-\nticular protein responds to a signal different from that which\nmodulates the protein phosphatase that catalyzes dephos-\nphorylation of the resulting phosphoprotein, then even the\nsimplest phosphoprotein becomes a decision node . Its func-\ntional output reflects the phosphoprotein\u2019s degree or state of\nphosphorylation, which reflects the relative strength of the\nsignals that modulate the protein kinase and protein phospha-\ntase.

Hence, interconvertible enzymes and the\nenzymes responsible for their interconversion act, not as iso-\nlated \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d switches, but as binary elements within\nintegrated biomolecular information processing networks.\nOne well-studied example of such a network is the eukary-\notic cell cycle that controls cell division. Upon emergence from\ntheG0or quiescent state, the extremely complex process of\ncell division proceeds through a series of specific phases des-\nignated G1, S,G2, and M ( Figure 9\u20138). Elaborate monitoring\nsystems, called checkpoints , assess key indicators of progress\nto ensure that no phase of the cycle is initiated until the prior\nphase is complete. Figure 9\u20138 outlines, in simplified form, a\nchromosome-associated protein kinase called ATM binding to\nand being activated by regions of chromatin-containing double-\nstranded breaks in the DNA. Upon activation, one subunitof the activated ATM dimer dissociates and initiates a series,\nor cascade, of protein phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation\nevents mediated by the CHK1 and CHK2 protein kinases, the\nCdc25 protein phosphatase, and finally a complex between a\ncyclin and a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, or Cdk. In this\ncase, activation of the Cdk-cyclin complex blocks the G1to S\ntransition, thus preventing the replication of damaged DNA.\nFailure at this checkpoint can lead to mutations in DNA that\nmay lead to cancer or other diseases. Additional checkpoints\nand signaling cascades (not shown) interact together to con-\ntrol cell cycle progression in response to multiple indicators of\ncell status.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Homeostasis involves maintaining a relatively constant\nintracellular \nand intraorgan environment despite wide\nfluctuations in the external environment.

Calcium, the majority of\nwhich is contained in bones, teeth, and cartilage, contributes a\nfurther \u2248 2%. The remaining 0.4 to 0.5% is accounted for by\nnumerous inorganic elements ( Table 10\u20131 ). Many of these are\nessential for health, albeit in minute quantities, and thus are\ncommonly classified as micronutrients . Examples of physiolog-\nically essential micronutrients include iodine, which is required\nfor the synthesis of tri- and tetraiodothyronine (see Chapter 41);\nselenium, which is required for the synthesis of the amino acid\nselenocysteine (see Chapter 27); and vitamins (see Chapter 44).\nThe focus of the current chapter will be on the physiologic roles\nof the nutritionally essential transition metals iron (Fe), man-\nganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni),\nmolybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), and chromium (Cr).\nTransition Metals Are Multivalent\nOne common characteristic of metals is their propensity to\nundergo oxidat\nion, a process in which they donate one or\nmore electrons from their outer or valence shell to an elec-\ntronegative acceptor species, for example, molecular oxygen.\nOxidation of an alkali or alkaline earth metal ( Figure 10\u20131 )\nresults in a single ionized species, for example, Na+, K+, Li+,\nMg2+, or Ca2+. By contrast, the oxidat ion of transition metals\ncan yield multiple valence states (Table 10\u20132 ). This capabil-\nity enables transition metals to undergo dynamic transitions\nbetween valence states through the addition or donation ofelectrons, and therefore to function as an electron carrier dur-\ning oxidation\u2013reduction (redox) reactions. The ability of tran-\nsition metals to act as acids further expands their biologic roles.\nTransition Metal Ions Are Potent\nLewis \nAcids\nIn addition to serving as electron carriers, the functional\nca\npabilities of the nutritionally essential transition metals are\nenhanced by their ability to act as Lewis acids. Protic (Bronsted-\nLowry) acids can donate a proton (H+) to an acceptor with a\nlon\ne pair of electrons, for example, a primary amine or a mole-\ncule of water. Lewis acids , by contrast, are aprotic . Like H+ion s,\nLewis acids possess empty valence orbitals capable of nonco-\nvalently associating with or \u201caccepting\u201d a lone pair of electrons\nfrom a second, \u201cdonor\u201d molecule. When the ferrous (Fe2+) iron\nin \nmyoglobin and hemoglobin bind oxygen or other diatomic\ngases such carbon monoxide, they are acting as Lewis acids\n(see Chapter 8). Divalent Zn2+or Mn2+can serve as Lewis acids\nduring catalysis by hydrolytic enzymes, specifically by enhanc-\ning the nucleophilicity of active-site water molecules.\nTOXICITY OF HEAVY METALS\nMost heavy metals, a loosely defined term for metallic ele-\nments with densities great\ner than 5 g/cm3or ato mic numbers\ngreater than 20, are toxic. Some well-known examples include\narsenic, antimony, lead, mercury, and cadmium, whose toxic-\nity can arise via a number of mechanisms.\nDisplacement of an Essential Cation\nThe ability of a heavy metal to displace a functionally essen-\ntial \nmetal can readily lead to loss or impairment of enzyme\nfunction. Classic examples include the displacement of iron\nTABLE 10\u20131 Quantities of Selected Elements in the Human Body\nElement Mass Essential Element Mass Essential Element Mass Essential\nOxygen\n43 kg + Selenium 15 \u03bcg + Cadmium 50 \u03bcg \u2212\nCarbon 16 kg + Iron 4.2 g + Rubidium 680 \u03bcg \u2212\nHydrogen 7 kg + Zinc 2.3 g + Strontium 320 \u03bcg \u2212\nNitrogen 1.8 kg + Copper 72 \u03bcg + Titanium 20 \u03bcg \u2212\nPhosphorous 780 g + Nickel 15 \u03bcg + Silver 2 \u03bcg \u2212\nCalcium 1.0 kg + Chromium 14 \u03bcg + Niobium 1.5 \u03bcg \u2212\nSulfur 140 g + Manganese 12 \u03bcg + Zirconium 1 \u03bcg \u2212\nPotassium 140 g + Molybdenum 5 \u03bcg + Tungsten 20 ng \u2212\nSodium 100 g + Cobalt 3 \u03bcg + Yttrium 0.6 \u03bcg \u2212\nChlorine 95 g + Vanadium 0.1 \u03bcg + Cerium 40 \u03bcg \u2212\nMagnesium 19 g + Silicon 1.0 mg Possibly Bromine 260 \u03bcg \u2212\nIodine 20 \u03bcg + Fluorine* 2.6 g \u2212 Lead* 120 \u03bcg \u2212\nData for a 70-kg (150 lb) human are from Emsley J: The Elements, 3rd ed .

The sequestration of transition metals into\norganometallic complexes confers multiple advantages that\ninclude protection against oxidation, suppression of ROS pro-\nduction, enhancement of solubility, control of reactivity, and\nassembly of multimetal units ( Figure 10\u20134 ).Significance of Multivalent Capability\nPhysiologic function of transition metal\u2013containing cofactors\nand \nprosthetic groups is dependent on maintaining a multiva-\nlent ion\u2019s appropriate oxidation state.

Each of the four distinct, nonhomologous\nSODs \ncontain different transition metals whose atomic sym-\nbols are used to designate each family: Fe-SODs, Mn-SODs,\nNi-SODs, and Cu, Zn-SODs.Complexation Can Organize Multiple\nMetal \nIons in a Single Functional Unit\nThe formation of organometallic complexes also allows mul-\ntiple \nmetal ions to be assembled together in a single functional\nunit with capabilities that lie beyond those obtainable with\na single transition metal ion. In the enzyme urease, which\ncatalyzes the hydrolysis of urea in plants, the presence of two\nNi atoms within the active site enables the enzyme to simul-\ntaneously polarize electrons in the C-N bond targeted for\nhydrolysis and to activate the attacking water molecule (see\nFigure 10\u20134). The presence of two Fe and two Cu atoms in\ncytochrome oxidase enables the complex IV of the electron\ntransport chain to accumulate the four electrons needed to\ncarry out the reduction of oxygen to water. Similarly, the bac-\nterial enzyme nitrogenase employs an 8Fe-7S prosthetic group\ncalled the P-cluster and a unique Fe, Mo-cofactor to carry\nout the eight-electron reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to\nammonia.\nPHYSIOLOGIC ROLES OF THE\nESSENTIAL \nTRANSITION METALS\nIron\nIron is one of the most functionally versatile of the physi-\nologically \nessential transition metals. Both in hemoglobin\nand myoglobin the heme-bound Fe2+iron is used to bind a\ndiatomic gas, O2, for transport and storage, respectively (see\nChapt\ner 6). Similarly, in marine invertebrates, the iron pres-\nent in the diiron center of hemerythrin (Figure 10\u20135 ) can\nbind and transport oxygen. By contrast, the iron atoms con-\ntained in the heme groups of the b- and c-type cytochromes\nand the Fe-S clusters (see Figure 13\u20134) and Rieske iron centers\n(Figure 10\u20136 ) of other electron transport chain components\ntransport electrons by cycling between their ferrous (+2) and\nferric state (+3).\nRoles of Iron in Redox Reactions\nThe iron atoms of many metalloproteins facilitate the catalysis\nof o\nxidation\u2013reduction, or redox, reactions.

Myeloperoxidase employs heme iron to catalyze the\ncondensation of H2O2with Cl\u2212ions to g enerate hypochlorous\nacid, HOCl, a potent bacteriocide used by macrophages to kill\nentrapped microorganisms. It recently has been shown that\nmany enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair, includ-\ning DNA helicase, DNA primase, several DNA polymerases,\nsome glycosylases and endonucleases, and several transcrip-\ntion factors contain Fe-S clusters. While their elimination gen-\nerally results in a loss of protein function, the specific role(s)\nperformed by these Fe-S centers remains cryptic. However,\nsince most are located in the DNA binding, rather than the\ncatalytic, domains of these proteins, it has been proposed that\nthese Fe-S centers may function as electrochemical detectors\nfor the identification of damaged DNA. Others speculate that\nthese clusters serve as redox-sensitive modulators of catalytic\nactivity or DNA binding, or simply as stabilizers of the three-\ndimensional structure of these proteins.\nManganese\nHumans contain a handful of Mn-containing enzymes, the\nmajori\nty of which are located within the mitochondria. These\ninclude isocitrate dehydrogenase from the tricarboxylic acid\n(TCA) cycle, two key players in nitrogen metabolism: gluta-\nmate synthetase and arginase, and the gluconeogenic enzymes\npyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyki-\nnase, isopropyl malate synthase, and the mitochondrial iso-\nzyme of superoxide dismutase. In most of these enzymes, Mn\nis present in the +2 oxidation state and is presumed to act as a\nLewis acid. By contrast, some bacterial organisms employ Mn\nin several enzymes responsible for catalyzing redox reactions,where it cycles between the +2 and +3 oxidation states in, for\nexample, Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), Mn-ribonu-\ncleotide reductase, and Mn-catalase.\nZinc\nUnlike the divalent (+2) ions of other first-row transition met-\nals (see Figure 10\u20131), the valence \nshell of Zn2+possesses a full\nset \nof electrons. As a consequence, Zn2+ions do not adopt\nalternate oxidation states under physiologic conditions, ren-\ndering it unsuitable to participate in electron transport pro-\ncesses or as a catalyst for redox reactions. On the other hand,\nredox inert Zn2+ions also pose a minimal risk of generating\nharmful ROS species. Its unique status among the physiologi-\ncally essential transition metals renders Zn2+an ideal candi-\ndate as a ligand for stabilizing the protein conformation.\nIt has been estimated that the human body contains 3000\nzinc-containing metalloproteins. The vast majority of these\nare transcription factors and other DNA- and RNA-binding\nproteins that contain anywhere from one to thirty copies of\na Zn2+-containing polynucleotide-binding domain known\nas \nthe zinc finger. Zinc fingers consist of a polypeptide loop\nwhose conformation is stabilized by the interactions between\nZn2+and lone pairs of electrons donated by the sulfur and\nnitrogen atoms contained in two conserved cysteine and two\nconserved histidine residues (see Figure 38\u201316). Zinc fingers\nbind polynucleotides with a high degree of site specificity that\nis conferred, at least in part, by variations in the sequence of\namino acids that make up the remainder of the loop. Scientists\nare working to exploit this combination of small size and bind-\ning specificity to construct sequence-specific nucleases for use\nin genetic engineering and, eventually, gene therapy.\nZn2+is also an essential component of several metalloen-\nzymes, including carboxypeptidase A, carbonic anhydrase II,\nadenosine deaminase, alkaline phosphatase, phospholipase\nC, leucine aminopeptidase, the cytosolic form of superoxide\ndismutase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. Zn2+is also a compo-\nnent of the type II \u03b2-lactamases used by bacteria to neutralize\npenicillin and other lactam antibiotics. These metalloenzymes\nexploit the Lewis acid properties of Zn2+to s tabilize the devel-\nopment of negatively charged intermediates, polarize the dis-\ntribution of electrons in carbonyl groups, and enhance the\nnucleophilicity of water (Figure 10\u20137 ).\nCobalt\nThe predominant and, thus far, only known biochemical func-\ntion \nof dietary cobalt is as the core component of 5 \u2032-deoxy-\nadenosylcobalamin, otherwise known as vitamin B12(see\nFigure \n44\u201310). The Co3+in this cofactor resides at the cen-\nter of a tetrapyrrole corrin ring where it acts as a Lewis base\nthat binds to and facilitates the transfer of one-carbon methyl\nor methylene groups. In humans, this includes the enzyme\ncatalyzed transfer of a \u2013CH3group from tetrahydrofolate to\nhomocysteine, the final step in the synthesis of the amino\nacid methionine (see Figure 44\u201313), and the rearrangement\nof methylmalonyl-CoA to form succinyl-CoA during theNN\nHisHis\nNHNHS\nS SS\nSFe FeCys\nCys\nFIGURE 10\u20136 Structure of a Rieske iron center.

More\ninforma\ntion of Co and vitamin B12can be found in Chapter 44.\nCopper\nCopper is a functionally essential component of approxi-\nmat\nely 30 different metalloenzymes in humans, including\ncytochrome oxidase, dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase, tyrosinase, the\ncytosolic form of superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD), and\nlysyl oxidase. Dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase and tyrosinase are\nboth catecholamine oxidases, enzymes that oxidize the ortho-\nposition in the phenol rings of L-dopamine (see Figure 41\u201310)\nand tyrosine, respectively. The former is the final step in the\npathway by which epinephrine is synthesized in the adrenal\ngland, while the latter is the first and rate-limiting step in\nthe synthesis of melanin. Both dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase and\ntyrosinase are members of the type-3 family of copper pro-\nteins, which share a common dicopper center. As shown in\nFigure 10\u20138 , the copper atoms in catecholamine oxidases che-\nlate a molecule of molecular oxygen, activating it for attack\non a phenol ring. During this process the copper atoms cycle\nbetween the +2 and +1 oxidation states. Another type-3 copper\nprotein is hemocyanin. Unlike the catecholamine oxidases, the\ndicopper center of hemocyanin serves to transport oxygen in\ninvertebrate animals such as mollusks that lack hemoglobin.\nIn Cu, Zn-SOD, the Cu2+ato m in the bimetallic center\nabstracts an electron from superoxide, O2\u2212, an extremely reac-\ntive \nand cytotoxic ROS, forming O2and Cu1+. The Cu atom\nin \nthe enzyme is then restored to its original, +2, valence\nstate by donating an electron to a second molecule of super-\noxide, generating H2O2. While hydrogen peroxide also is a\nROS, it is \nconsiderably less reactive than O2\u2212, a radical anion.\nMo\nreover, it can be subsequently converted to water and O2\nthrough \nthe action of a second detoxifying enzyme, catalase\n(see Chapter 12).Lysyl oxidase employs a single atom of Cu2+to convert\nthe epsilon amino groups on lysine side chains in collagen or\nelastin to aldehydes using molecular oxygen. The aldehyde\ngroups on the side chain of the resulting amino acid, allysine\n(2-amino-6-oxo-hexanoic acid), then chemically react with\nthe side chains of other allysine or lysine residues on adjacent\npolypeptides to generate the chemical crosslinks essential to\nthe exceptional tensile strength of mature collagen and elastin\nfibers. Another essential feature of the enzyme is the presence\nof a modified amino acid, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine qui-\nnone, in the active site. This modification is generated by the\nautocatalytic oxidation of the side chain of a conserved tyrosine\nresidue by lysyl oxidase itself.\nNickel\nA variety of nickel-containing enzymes are present in bacterial\norga\nnisms. Examples include Ni, Fe hydrogenase and methyl-\ncoenzyme M reductase, which catalyze redox reactions; ace-\ntyl-CoA synthase, which catalyzes a transferase reaction; and\nsuperoxide dismutase, which catalyzes a disproportionation\nreaction. Ni is a key component of urease, an enzyme found\nin bacteria, fungi, and plants (see Figure 10\u20134). However,\nthe molecular basis of the dietary requirement for nickel in\nhumans and other mammals has yet to be discovered.\nMolybdenum\nCatalytic Roles of Molybdopterin\nMolybdenum is a key component of the phylogenetically uni-\nversal \ncofactor molybdopterin (see Figure 10\u20133). In animals,\nmolybdopterin serves as a catalytically essential prosthetic\ngroup for many enzymes, including xanthine oxidase, alde-\nhyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase. Xanthine oxidase, which\nalso contains flavin, catalyzes the final two oxidative steps in\nthe pathway by which uric acid is synthesized from purine\nnucleotides: the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and\nthe oxidation of xanthine to uric acid (see Chapter 33).

No vanadium-containing cofactor\nhas been identified to date. Vanadium is found throughout\nthe body in both its +4, for example, HVO42\u2013, H2VO4\u2013, etc.,\nand +5 oxidation states, for examp\nle, VO2+, HVO3+, etc. Vari-\nous \nplasma proteins are known to bind oxides of vanadium,\nincluding albumin, immunoglobulin G, and transferrin. It has\nalso recently been discovered that vanadium is a key compo-\nnent of the secreted \u201cglue\u201d with which marine mussels secure\nthemselves to rocks, pilings, and ship\u2019s bottoms. Although van-\nadate, a phosphate analog, is known to inhibit protein-tyrosine\nphosphatases and alkaline phosphatase in vitro , it is unclear\nwhether these interactions are of physiologic significance.\nChromium\nThe role of Cr in humans remains unknown. In the 1950s, a\nCr3+-containing \u201cglucose tolerance factor\u201d was isolated from\nbrewer\n\u2019s yeast whose laboratory effects implicated this transi-\ntion metal as a cofactor in the regulation of glucose metabo-\nlism. However, decades of research have failed to uncover\neither a Cr-containing biomolecule or a Cr-related genetic\ndisease in animals. Nevertheless, many persons continue to\ningest Cr-containing dietary supplements, such as Cr3+-pico-\nlinate\n, for their alleged weight-loss properties.\nABSORPTION & TRANSPORT\nOF \nTRANSITION METALS\nTransition Metals Are Absorbed by\nDiverse \nMechanisms\nIn general, intestinal uptake of most transition metals is\nrela\ntively inefficient. Only a small portion of the transition\nmetals ingested each day is absorbed into our bodies. In addi-\ntion, some transition metals, such as Ni and V , can be readily\nabsorbed through the lungs when present in contaminated air\nor as a component of cigarette smoke. The perceived \u201cinef-\nficiency\u201d of intestinal absorption may reflect the combination\nof the human body\u2019s modest requirements for these elements\nand the need to buffer against the accumulation of excessive\namounts of these potentially toxic heavy metals. While we\nunderstand the pathways by which some transition metals,\nsuch as Fe (see Chapter 52), are taken up in great detail, in\nother instances, little hard evidence has been uncovered.\nFe2+is a bsorbed directly via a transmembrane protein, the\ndivalent metal ion transport protein (DMT-1), in the proxi-\nmal duodenum. DMT-1 is also postulated to constitute the\nprimary vehicle for the uptake of Mn2+, Ni2+, and\u2014to a lesserextent\u2014C\nu2+. As most of the iron in the stomach is in the ferric\nsta\nte, Fe3+, it must be reduced to the ferrous, Fe2+, state in order\nto be ab\nsorbed. This reaction is catalyzed by a ferric reductase\nthat is also present on the cell surface, duodenal cytochrome b\n(Dcytb) . In addition, Dcytb is responsible for reducing Cu2+to\nCu1+prio r to transport by the high affinity Cu transport protein\nCtr1. However, excess levels of Zn can inhibit Cu absorption,\nwhich can lead to a potentially lethal anemia. Molybdenum\nand vanadium are absorbed in the gut as the oxyanions vana-\ndate, HVO42\u2212, and molybdate, HMoO42\u2212, by the same nonspe-\ncific \nanion transporter responsible for the absorption of their\nstructural analogs phosphate, HPO42\u2212, and sulfate, SO42\u2212.\nCobalt is a\nbsorbed as the organometallic complex cobala-\nmin, that is, vitamin B12, via a dedicated pathway involving two\nsecreted cobalamin-bindin\ng proteins, haptocorrin and intrin-\nsic factor, and a cell surface receptor, cubilin. In the stomach,\ncobalamin released from ingested foods binds to haptocor-\nrin, which protects the coenzyme from the extreme pH of its\ngastric surroundings. As the cobalamin-haptocorrin complex\nmoves into the duodenum, the pH rises, inducing dissocia-\ntion of the complex. The released cobalamin is then bound by\na haptocorrin homolog known as intrinsic factor. The result-\ning cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex is then recognized\nand internalized by cubilin receptors present on the surface of\nintestinal epithelial cells.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Maintenance of human health and vitality requires the dietary\nuptake \nof trace quantities of several inorganic elements,\nincluding several transition metals.\n\u25a0Paradoxically, many heavy metals, including excess levels of\nsome \nof the nutritionally essential transition metals, are toxic\nand potentially carcinogenic.\n\u25a0Acute heavy metal poisoning is treated by ingestion of\nchela\nting agents, the administration of diuretics along with the\ningestion of water, or hemodialysis.\n\u25a0Most heavy metals, including essential transition metals, can\ngenera\nte ROS in the presence of water and oxygen.\n\u25a0The capacity of transition metals to serve as carriers for\nelectrons \nand diatomic gases, as well as to facilitate catalysis of\na wide range of enzymatic reactions, derives from two factors:\ntheir ability to transition between multiple valence states and\ntheir Lewis acid properties.\n\u25a0In the body, transition metal ions are rarely encountered in free\nform. \nIn most instances, they exist in organometallic complexes\nbound to proteins either directly by amino acid side chains or\nas part of organometallic prosthetic groups such as hemes, Fe-S\nclusters, or molybdopterin.\n\u25a0Incorporation into organometallic complexes serves as a means\nof \noptimizing the properties of associated transition metals,\nprevents the collateral generation of ROS, and organizes\nmultiple transition metals into a single functional unit.\n\u25a0In the electron transport chain, many key electron transfer\nevents \nrely on the ability of Fe atoms present in hemes, Fe-S\nclusters, and Rieske iron centers to transition between their\n+2 and +3 oxidation states."

Under conditions of constant temperature and\npressure, the relationship between the free-energy change\n(\u0394G) of a reacting system and the change in entropy (\u0394 S) is\nexpressed by the following equation, which combines the two\nlaws of thermodynamics:\nG  H  T  S\u2206  = \u2206  \u2212  \u2206\nwhere \u0394 His the change in enthalpy (heat) and Tis the abso-\nlute temperature.\nIn biochemical reactions, since \u0394 His approximately equal\nto the total change in internal energy of the reaction or \u0394 E,\nthe above relationship may be expressed in the following way:\nG  E  T  S\u2206  = \u2206  \u2212  \u2206\nIf \u0394Gis negative, the reaction proceeds spontaneously with\nloss of free energy, that is, it is exergonic . If, in addition, \u0394 Gis\nof great magnitude, the reaction goes virtually to completion\nand is essentially irreversible. On the other hand, if \u0394 Gis posi-\ntive, the reaction proceeds only if free energy can be gained,\nthat is, it is endergonic . If, in addition, the magnitude of \u0394 Gis\ngreat, the system is stable, with little or no tendency for a reac-\ntion to occur. If \u0394 Gis zero, the system is at equilibrium and no\nnet change takes place.\nWhen the reactants are present in concentrations of\n1.0 mol/L, \u0394 G0is the standard free-energy change. For bio-\nchemical reactions, a standard state is defined as having a pH\nof 7.0. The standard free-energy change at this standard state\nis denoted by \u0394 G0\u2032.\nThe \nstandard free-energy change can be calculated from\nthe equilibrium constant Keq,\nG\n RT  K \u2206\u2032= \u2212 ln0\neq\nwhere Ris the gas constant a ndTis the absolute temperature\n(see Chapter 8). It is important to note that the actual \u0394 Gmay\nbe larger or smaller than \u0394 G0\u2032depending on the concentra-\ntions of the various reactants, including the solvent, various\nions, and proteins.\nIn a biochemical system, an enzyme only speeds up the\nattainment of equilibrium; it never alters the final concentra-\ntions of the reactants at equilibrium.\nENDERGONIC PROCESSES\nPROCEED \nBY COUPLING TO\nEXERGONIC PROCESSES\nThe vital processes\u2014for example, biosynthetic reactions,\nmuscular \ncontraction, nerve impulse conduction, and active\ntransport\u2014obtain energy by chemical linkage, or coupling , to\noxidative reactions. In its simplest form, this type of couplingmay be represented as shown in Figure 11\u20131 . The conversion\nof metabolite A to metabolite B occurs with release of free\nenergy and is coupled to another reaction in which free energy\nis required to convert metabolite C to metabolite D. The terms\nexergonic andendergonic , rather than the normal chemical\nterms \u201cexothermic\u201d and \u201cendothermic, \u201d are used to indicate\nthat a process is accompanied by loss or gain, respectively, of\nfree energy in any form, not necessarily as heat. In practice, an\nendergonic process cannot exist independently, but must be a\ncomponent of a coupled exergonic\u2013endergonic system where\nthe overall net change is exergonic. The exergonic reactions\nare termed catabolism (generally, the breakdown or oxidation\nof fuel molecules), whereas the synthetic reactions that build\nup substances are termed anabolism . The combined catabolic\nand anabolic processes constitute metabolism .\nIf the reaction shown in Figure 11\u20131 is to go from left to\nright, then the overall process must be accompanied by loss\nof free energy as heat. One possible mechanism of coupling\ncould be envisaged if a common obligatory intermediate (I)\ntook part in both reactions, that is,\nA + C \u2192I\u2192B + D\nSome exergonic and endergonic reactions in biologic systems\nare coupled in this way. This type of system has a built-in mech-\nanism for biologic control of the rate of oxidative processes\nsince the common obligatory intermediate allows the rate of\nutilization of the product of the synthetic path (D) to deter-\nmine by mass action the rate at which A is oxidized. Indeed,\nthese relationships supply a basis for the concept of respiratory\ncontrol , the process that prevents an organism from burning\nout of control. An extension of the coupling concept is pro-\nvided by dehydrogenation reactions, which are coupled to\nhydrogenations by an intermediate carrier ( Figure 11\u20132 ).\nAn alternative method of coupling an exergonic to an end-\nergonic process is to synthesize a compound of high-energy\npotential in the exergonic reaction and to incorporate thisA\nHeat\nChemical\nenergyD\nB CExergonic\nEndergonicFree energy\nA + C B + D + Heat\nFIGURE 11\u20131 Coupling of an exergonic to an endergonic\nreaction."

The biologic advantage of this mechanism is\nthat the compound of high potential energy, ~ , unlike I in\nthe previous system, need not be structurally related to A, B,\nC, or D, allowing to serve as a transducer of energy from a\nwide range of exergonic reactions to an equally wide range of\nendergonic reactions or processes, such as biosynthesis, mus-\ncular contraction, nervous excitation, and active transport. In\nthe living cell, the principal high-energy intermediate or car-\nrier compound is ATP (Figure 11\u20133 ).\nHIGH-ENERGY PHOSPHATES\nPLA\nY A CENTRAL ROLE IN ENERGY\nCAPTURE & TRANSFER\nIn order to maintain living processes, all organisms must obtain\nsup\nplies of free energy from their environment. Autotrophic\norganisms utilize simple exergonic processes; for example, the\nenergy of sunlight (green plants), the reaction Fe2+\u2192Fe3+\n(some \nbacteria). On the other hand, heterotrophic organ-\nisms obtain free energy by coupling their metabolism to the\nbreakdown of complex organic molecules in their environ-\nment. In all these organisms, ATP plays a central role in the\ntransference of free energy from the exergonic to the ender-\ngonic processes. ATP is a nucleotide consisting of the nucleo-\nside adenosine (adenine linked to ribose) and three phosphate\ngroups (see Chapter 32). In its reactions in the cell, it functions\nas the Mg2+com plex (see Figure 11\u20133).\nThe importance of phosphates in intermediary metabo-\nlism became evident with the discovery of the role of ATP ,\nadenosine diphosphate (ADP), and inorganic phosphate (Pi)\nin glyco\nlysis (see Chapter 17).The Intermediate Value for the Free\nEnergy \nof Hydrolysis of ATP Has\nImportant Bioenergetic Significance\nThe standard free energy of hydrolysis of a number of bio-\nchemically impo\nrtant phosphates is shown in Table 11\u20131 . An\nestimate of the comparative tendency of each of the phosphate\ngroups to transfer to a suitable acceptor may be obtained from\nthe \u0394 G0\u2032of hydrolysis at 37\u00b0C. This is termed the group trans-\nfer potential . The value for the hydrolysis of the terminal phos-\nphate of ATP (when ATP is converted to ADP + Pi) divides\nthe list into two groups. Low-energy phosphates , having a low\ngroup transfer potential, exemplified by the ester phosphates\nfound in the intermediates of glycolysis, have G0\u2032value s smaller\nthan that of ATP , while in high-energy phosphates , with a\nmore negative G0\u2032, the value is higher than that of ATP . The\ncom\nponents of this latter group, including ATP , are usually\nanhydrides (eg, the 1-phosphate of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate),\nenol phosphates (eg, phosphoenolpyruvate), and phosphogua-\nnidines (eg, creatine phosphate, arginine phosphate).\nThe symbol ~ Pindicates that the group attached to the\nbond, on transfer to an appropriate acceptor, results in trans-\nfer of the larger quantity of free energy. Thus, ATP has a high\ngroup transfer potential, whereas the phosphate in adenosine\nmonophosphate (AMP) is of the low-energy type since it is a\nnormal ester link ( Figure 11\u20134 ).

The high free-energy change\non hydrolysis of ATP is not in itself caused by the breaking\nof the P-O bond linking the terminal phosphate to the mol-\necule (see Figure 11\u20134), in fact, energy is needed to bring\nthis about. It is the consequences of this bond breakage that\ncause net energy to be released. Firstly, there is strong electro-\nstatic repulsion between the negatively charged oxygen atoms\nin the adjacent phosphate groups of ATP (see Figure 11\u20134),\nwhich destabilizes the molecule and makes the removal of one\nphosphate group energetically favorable. Secondly, the ortho-\nphosphate produced is greatly stabilized by the formation of\nresonance hybrids in which the three negative charges are\nshared between the four oxygen atoms. Overall, therefore, theproducts of hydrolysis, ADP and orthophosphate, are more\nstable, and so lower in energy, than ATP ( Figure 11\u20135 ). Other\n\u201chigh-energy compounds\u201d are thiol esters involving coenzyme\nA (eg, acetyl-CoA), acyl carrier protein, amino acid esters\ninvolved in protein synthesis, S-adenosylmethionine (active\nmethionine), uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPGlc), and\n5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP).\nATP ACTS AS THE \u201cENERGY\nCURRENCY\u201d\n OF THE CELL\nThe high group transfer potential of ATP enables it to act as\na \ndonor of high-energy phosphate to form those compounds\nbelow it in Table 11\u20131. Likewise, with the necessary enzymes,\nADP can accept phosphate groups to form ATP from those\ncompounds above ATP in the table. In effect, an ATP/ADP\ncycle connects those processes that generate ~  to those pro-\ncesses that utilize ~  ( Figure 11\u20136 ), continuously consuming\nand regenerating ATP . This occurs at a very rapid rate since\nthe total ATP/ADP pool is extremely small and sufficient to\nmaintain an active tissue for only a few seconds.\nThere are three major sources of ~  taking part in energy\nconservation orenergy capture :\n1.

In addition, the orthophosphate released is\ngreatly stabilized by the formation of resonance hybrids in which the three negative charges are shared between the four oxygen atoms.

Most of this takes place inside\nmitochondria , which have been termed the \u201cpowerhouses\u201d\nof the cell. Respiration is coupled to the generation of the\nhigh-energy intermediate, ATP (see Chapter 11), by oxida-\ntive phosphorylation . A number of drugs (eg, amobarbital )\nand poisons (eg, cyanide, carbon monoxide ) inhibit oxida-\ntive phosphorylation, usually with fatal consequences. Sev-\neral inherited defects of mitochondria involving components\nof the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation have\nbeen reported. Patients present with myopathy andencepha-\nlopathy and often have lactic acidosis .\nSPECIFIC ENZYMES\nARE \nASSOCIATED WITH\nCOMPARTMENTS SEPARATED\nBY THE MITOCHONDRIAL\nMEMBRANES\nThe mitochondrial ma trix(the internal compartment) is enclosed\nby a double membrane . The outer membrane is permeable to\nmost metabolites and the inner membrane is selectively perme-\nable ( Figure 13\u20131 ). The outer membrane is characterized by\nthe presence of various enzymes, including acyl-CoA synthetase\n(see Chapter 22) and glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (see\nChapter 24). Other enzymes, including adenylyl kinase\n(see Chapter 11) and creatine kinase (see Chapter 51) are\nfound in the intermembrane space .

The enzymes of the citric acid cycle and\n\u03b2-oxidation (see Chapters 22 and 16), the respiratory chain\ncomplexes , and the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation\nare all found in mitochondria. The respiratory chain collects\nand transports reducing equivalents, directing them to their\nfinal reaction with oxygen to form water, and oxidative phos-\nphorylation is the process by which the liberated free energy is\ntrapped as high-energy phosphate (ATP) .\nComponents of the Respiratory Chain\nAre \nContained in Four Large Protein\nComplexes Embedded in the Inner\nMitochondrial Membrane\nElectrons flow through the respiratory chain through a redox span\no\nf 1.1 V from NAD+/NADH to O2/2H2O (see Table 12\u20131), passing\nth\nrough three large protein complexes: NADH-Q oxidoreduc-\ntase (Complex I) , where electrons are transferred from NADH\ntocoenzyme Q (Q) (also called ubiquinone );Q-cytochrome c\noxidoreductase (Complex III) , which passes the electrons on\ntocytochrome c; and cytochrome coxidase (Complex IV) ,\nwhich completes the chain, passing the electrons to O2a nd caus-\ning it to be reduced to H2O (F igure 13\u20133 ). Some substrates with\nmore positive redox potentials than NAD+/NADH (eg, succinate)\npa\nss electrons to Q via a fourth complex, succinate-Q reduc-\ntase (Complex II) , rather than Complex I. The four complexes\nare embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but Q and\ncytochrome care mobile.

The oxidized flavin nucleotide (flavin\nmononucleotide [FMN] or flavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD])\ncan be reduced in reactions involving the transfer of two elec-\ntrons (to form FMNH2or FADH2), but they can also accept\none \nelectron to form the semiquinone (see Figure 12\u20132). Iron-\nsulfur proteins (nonheme iron proteins, Fe-S) are found in\nComplexes I, II, and III. These may contain one, two, or four\nFe atoms linked to inorganic sulfur atoms and/or via cysteine-\nSH groups to the protein ( Figure 13\u20134 ).

As we have seen, Complexes I, III, and IV act\nasproton pumps , moving H+from the mitocho ndrial matrix\nto the intermembrane space. Since the inner mitochondrial\nmembrane is impermeable to ions in general and particularly\nto protons, these accumulate in the intermembrane space, cre-\nating the proton motive force predicted by the chemiosmotic\ntheory.A Membrane-Located ATP Synthase\nF\nunctions as a Rotary Motor to Form ATP\nThe proton motive force drives a membrane-located ATP syn-\ntha\nse that forms ATP in the presence of Pi+ ADP .

On\nthe other hand, when 1 mol of substrate (eg, succinate or\n3-phophoglycerate) is oxidized via Complexes II, III, and IV ,\nonly 1.5 mol of ATP are formed, that is, P:O = 1.5.

When work is performed, ATP is\nconverted to ADP , allowing more respiration to occur, which\nin turn replenishes the store of ATP . Under certain conditions,\nthe concentration of inorganic phosphate can also affect the\nrate of functioning of the respiratory chain. As respiration\nincreases (as in exercise), the cell approaches states 3 or 5\nwhen either the capacity of the respiratory chain becomes sat-\nurated or the PO2decreases below the Kmfor heme a3. There\nis \nalso the possibility that the ADP/ATP transporter, which\nfacilitates entry of cytosolic ADP into and ATP out of the\nmitochondrion, becomes rate limiting.\nThus, the manner in which biologic oxidative processes\nallow the free energy resulting from the oxidation of food-\nstuffs to become available and to be captured is stepwise,\nefficient, and controlled\u2014rather than explosive, inefficient,\nand uncontrolled, as in many nonbiologic processes.

They may be classified as inhibitors of\nthe respiratory chain, inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation,\nor uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation.\nBarbiturates such as amobarbital inhibit electron trans-\nport via Complex I by blocking the transfer from Fe-S to Q.\nAt sufficient dosage, they are fatal. Antimycin A anddimer-\ncaprol inhibit the respiratory chain at Complex III. The classic\npoisons H2S,ca rbon monoxide , and cyanide inhibit Complex IV\nand can therefore totally arrest respiration. Malonate is a com-\npetitive inhibitor of Complex II.\nAtractyloside inhibits oxidative phosphorylation by\ninhibiting the transporter of ADP into and ATP out of the\nmitochondrion ( Figure 13\u201310 ). The antibiotic oligomycin\ncompletely blocks oxidation and phosphorylation by blocking\nthe flow of protons through ATP synthase (see Figure 13\u20138).\nUncouplers dissociate oxidation in the respiratory chain\nfrom phosphorylation (see Figure 13\u20137). These compounds\nare toxic, causing respiration to become uncontrolled, since\nthe rate is no longer limited by the concentration of ADP or Pi.\nThe \nuncoupler that has been used most frequently in studies\nof the respiratory chain is 2,4-dinitrophenol , but other com-\npounds act in a similar manner.

The net uptake\nof \nmalate by the dicarboxylate transporter requires inorganic\nphosphate for exchange in the opposite direction. The net\nuptake of citrate, isocitrate, or cis-aconitate by the tricarboxyl-\nate transporter requires malate in exchange. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate\ntransport also requires an exchange with malate. The adenine\nnucleotide transporter allows the exchange of ATP and ADP ,\nbut not AMP .

It includes the pathways\ntaken by individual molecules in a specific cell, the interrela-\ntionships of pathways in cells and between cells in an organ\nas well as between organs, and the regulatory mechanisms\nthat regulate the flow of metabolites through the pathways.\nMetabolic pathways fall into three categories. (1) Anabolic\npathways are involved in the synthesis of larger and more\ncomplex compounds from smaller precursors\u2014for example,\nthe synthesis of protein from amino acids and the synthesis\nof triacylglycerol and glycogen from carbohydrates. Anabolic\npathways are endothermic and thus require reducing equiva-\nlents or ATP to support the pathways. (2) Catabolic pathways\nare involved in the breakdown of larger molecules, commonly\ninvolving oxidative reactions. They are exothermic, produc-\ning reducing equivalents, and, mainly via the respiratory chain\n(see Chapter 13), ATP . (3) Amphibolic pathways occur at the\u201ccrossroads\u201d of metabolism. They can participate in both ana-\nbolic and catabolic functions, for example, the citric acid cycle\n(see Chapter 16).\nKnowledge of normal metabolism is essential for an\nunderstanding of abnormalities that underlie disease.\nNormal metabolism requires that the metabolism in cells\ncan not only perform their normal resting or basal metabolic\nfunctions but they can adapt to a changing environment. This\nincludes appropriate adaptation to periods of feasting, fasting,\nstarvation, and exercise, as well as pregnancy and lactation.\nAbnormal metabolism may result from nutritional deficiency,\ncaloric excess, enzyme deficiency or inappropriate regulation,\nabnormal secretion of hormones, or the actions of drugs and\ntoxins.\nA 70-kg adult human being requires about 8 to 12 MJ\n(1920-2900 kcal) from metabolic fuels each day, depend-\ning on physical activity. Caloric requirements increase as the\nsize of the animal increases. For any given size when animals\nare growing, they have a proportionally higher requirement\nto allow for the energy cost of growth. This energy require-\nment is met by our diet.

The resting or basal metabolic rate accounts for\n~60% of daily energy expenditure in humans. Physical activity\naccounts for a variable amount to total daily energy expendi-\nture as exercise can increase the metabolic rate by 40 to 50%\nover the basal or resting metabolic rate. Metabolism is not\nconstant in a given individual in a 24-hour period; we cycle\nbetween anabolism and catabolism. In a weight stable person\nthese processes on average are equal; we are in net zero energy\nbalance. Most people consume their daily intake of metabolic\nfuels in two or three meals, so there is net anabolism where\nwe store reserves of carbohydrate (glycogen in liver and mus-\ncle), lipid (triacylglycerol in adipose tissue), and labile protein\nstores. During the period following a meal we mobilize and\ncatabolize those stores when there is no intake of food.\nIf the intake of calories exceeds energy expenditure, the\nsurplus is stored, either as glycogen (liver and muscle) or as\ntriacylglycerol in adipose tissue. If this persists, it will lead to\nthe development of obesity and its associated health hazards.\nBy contrast, if the intake of metabolic fuels is consistently\nlower than energy expenditure (long-term energy deficit), the\nlimited reserves of fat and carbohydrate get exhausted forc-\ning the organism to oxidize amino acids. The amino acids\narising from protein turnover that are normally reused forreplacement protein synthesis are mobilized. This net pro-\ntein breakdown will lead to protein wasting, emaciation , and,\neventually, death (see Chapter 43).\nOVERVIEW OF SUBSTRATE\nMET\nABOLISM IN FASTING\n& FEASTING\nAfter an overnight fast the liver is the main source of glucose\n(~9 \ng/hr in humans). ( Figure 14\u20131 ). The glucose is derived\nfrom hepatic glycogen stores (via glycogenolysis) and synthe-\nsis of new glucose (via gluconeogenesis). In humans over 60%\n(~6 g/hr) of the glucose released by the liver is metabolized\nby the central nervous system (which is largely dependent\non glucose) and red blood cells (which are wholly reliant on\nglucose). Adipose tissue releases nonesterified fatty acids by\nhydrolysis of stored triglycerides. These fatty acids are the pri-\nmary oxidizable fuel for many tissues (heart, muscle, liver).\nThe liver can also synthesize ketone bodies from fatty acids\nto export to muscle and other tissues for oxidation. As liver\nglycogen reserves deplete, amino acids arising from net muscle\nprotein breakdown with prolonged fasting and lactate derived\nfrom hydrolysis of stored muscle glycogen provide carbons\nto support gluconeogenesis and thus provide glucose to the\nglucose-dependent tissues (see Chapter 19).\nIn the fed state, after a meal in which there is an ample\nsupply of carbohydrate, the metabolic fuel for most tis-\nsues switches to glucose (see Figure 14\u20131).

Adipose releases nonesterified fatty acids (FFA) that are used by\nthe liver and skeletal muscle. In the fed state, the intestine becomes the source of glucose. The liver switches to a glucose consumer, while brain\nglucose uptake is unaltered.

In contrast,\nglucose uptake by the brain and red blood cells is unaltered\n(~6 g/hr). The release of fatty acids from adipose tissue lipol-\nysis is suppressed and tissues primarily reliant on fatty acid\noxidation switch to glucose in part due to the decrease in fatty\nacid supply and increased glucose availability. Any dietary glu-\ncose not taken up by the liver is taken up by peripheral tissues\nfor oxidation or storage. It is stored in muscle as glycogen or in\nadipose tissue as triacylglycerol.\nThe formation and mobilization of reserves of triacylglyc-\nerol and glycogen, and the extent to which tissues take up and\noxidize glucose, are largely controlled by the hormones insulin\nandglucagon that are made in the endocrine pancreas. Their\neffects can also be modulated by other neural and/or endo-\ncrine signals (eg, sympathetic nervous system, growth hor-\nmone). Plasma glucose concentration is a tightly controlled\nvariable. Because of the absolute dependency of the central\nnervous system on glucose; we have neuroendocrine systems\nto protect against low blood glucose (ie, hypoglycemia).\nPATHWAYS TO PROCESS THE\nMAJOR \nPRODUCTS OF OUR DIET\nThe composition of the diet we eat dictates the general\nmetabolis\nm of an organism. There is a need to process the\nmajor products in the diet (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein)\ninto their basic components. These are mainly glucose, fatty\nacids and glycerol, and amino acids, respectively. If the com-\nposition of the diet changes (eg, high carbohydrate vs low\ncarbohydrate) metabolic pathways can adapt to metabolize\nthe nutrient. In ruminants (and, to a lesser extent, other her-\nbivores), dietary cellulose is fermented by symbiotic micro-\norganisms to short-chain fatty acids (acetic, propionic, butyric),\nand metabolism in these animals is adapted to use these fatty\nacids as major substrates. The products of digestion when com-\npletely oxidized go to a common product ,acetyl-CoA , which\nis then oxidized by the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 16)\n(Figure 14\u20132 ).\nCarbohydrate Metabolism Is Centered\non \nOxidation & Storage of Glucose\nGlucose is metabolized by all tissues and is an important\nenergy \nsource for many ( Figure 14\u20133 ). Glucose is first metab-\nolized to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase and from there\nit can go to many fates. It can be metabolized to pyruvate by\nthe pathway of glycolysis (see Chapter 17). In aerobic tissues\nthe pyruvate can be metabolized to acetyl-CoA , which can\nenter the citric acid cycle for complete oxidation to CO2an d\nH2O. The citric acid cycle is linked to the formation of ATP in\nthe\n process of oxidative phosphorylation (see Figure 13\u20132).\nGlycolysis can also occur anaerobically (in the absence of oxygen)\nwhere pyruvate is converted to the end product lactate.Glucose and its metabolites also take part in other pro-\ncesses. Glucose can be stored as a polymer called glycogen in\nskeletal muscle and liver (see Chapter 18). It can be diverted\nto the pentose phosphate pathway , an alternative to part of\nthe pathway of glycolysis (see Chapter 20). This pathway is a\nsource of reducing equivalents (NADPH) for fatty acid syn-\nthesis (see Chapter 23) and the source of ribose for nucleotide\nand nucleic acid synthesis (see Chapter 33). In the glycolytic\npathway triose phosphate intermediates can give rise to the\nglycerol moiety of triacylglycerols. Pyruvate can provide for\nthe synthesis of intermediates in the citric acid cycle that can\nprovide the carbon skeletons for the synthesis of nonessential\nor dispensable amino acids (see Chapter 27). Acetyl-CoA\nderived from pyruvate is the precursor for the synthesis of\nfatty acids (see Chapter 23) and cholesterol (see Chapter 26)\nand hence of all the steroid hormones synthesized in the body.\nSome tissues can synthesize glucose from precursors such as\nlactate, amino acids, and glycerol by the process of gluconeo-\ngenesis (see Chapter 19). This is important for suppling glu-\ncose when dietary carbohydrate is low or inadequate.\nLipid Metabolism Is Concerned Mainly\nWith \nFatty Acids & Cholesterol\nThe long-chain fatty acids are either derived from dietary lipid\nor \nsynthesized from acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrate\nor amino acids (lipogenesis). Fatty acids may be oxidized to\nacetyl-CoA (\u03b2-oxidation) or esterified with glycerol, forming\ntriacylglycerol as the body\u2019s main fuel reserve. Stored triacyl-\nglycerol (adipose tissue) can be mobilized ( lipolysis ) to release\nnonesterified fatty acids and glycerol.Amino acidsFatty acids\n+ glycerolSimple sugars\n(mainly glucose)\nCitric\nacid\ncycle\n2CO22H  ATPP\nrotein  Fat Carbohydrate\nAcetyl-CoADigestion and absorption\nCatabolism\nFIGURE 14\u20132 Outline of the pathways for the catabolism\nof \ncarbohydrate, protein, and fat.

The portal vein sends\nall of the absorbed substrates to the liver. Depending on the\nsubstrate, the liver can take up a small or large fraction of that\nwhich is delivered into the portal vein with the remaining\nallowed to pass into the systemic circulation. Substrates that\nenter the lymphatic circulation coalesce into a common tho-\nracic duct which bypasses the liver and drains its contents into\nthe systemic circulation.\nAmino acids resulting from the digestion of dietary pro-\ntein and glucose resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates\nare absorbed via the hepatic portal vein. The liver has the role\nof regulating the blood concentration of these water-soluble\nmetabolites ( Figure 14\u20136 ) by removing a variable portion of\nthese substrates before they enter the systemic circulation. The\nuptake of glucose and amino acids is a regulated process.\nIn the case of glucose, in the fed state ~10 to 15% of the\nabsorbed glucose is taken up by the liver (see Figure 14\u20131).\nThe majority is used to synthesize glycogen ( glycogenesis, see\nChapter 18). A small fraction is used for fatty acid synthesis\n(lipogenesis , see Chapter 23) and the remainder is broken\ndown by glycolysis to generate pyruvate that can be oxidized\nin the citric acid cycle for pyruvate oxidation. The glucose not\ntaken up by the liver is oxidized by the brain and many other\ntissues including skeletal muscle. Between meals, the liver rap-\nidly switches to a producer of glucose. It is the primary source\nof glucose in the fasted setting (see Figure 14\u20131). The glucose\nis derived from two sources; stored glycogen ( glycogenolysis ;see Chapter 18) and the synthesis of glucose from metabolites\nsuch as lactate, glycerol, and amino acids ( gluconeogenesis ;\nsee Chapter 19).\nThe liver is a consumer of many dietary amino acids. Like\nglucose only a fraction of the total absorbed amino acids are\nremoved by the liver. The remaining are removed by periph-\neral tissues. In the liver they are substrates for the synthesis of\nthe major plasma proteins (eg, albumin, fibrinogen). A sig-\nnificant fraction is deaminated . While the carbon backbone\nof amino acids can be oxidized, the nitrogen is converted to\nurea, transported to the kidney and excreted (see Chapter 28).\nThe remaining amino acids are taken up by peripheral tissues\nprimarily for protein synthesis.\nThe main dietary lipids (Figure 14\u20137 ) are triacylglycerols\nthat are hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerols and fatty acids in the\ngut, then reesterified in the intestinal mucosa. Here they are\npackaged with protein (ie, apolipoproteins) and secreted into the\nlymphatic system and thence into the bloodstream as chylomi-\ncrons , the largest of the plasma lipoproteins (see Chapter 25).\nChylomicrons also contain other lipid-soluble nutrients from\nthe diet, including vitamins A, D, E, and K (see Chapter 44).\nUnlike glucose and amino acids absorbed from the small intes-\ntine, chylomicron triacylglycerol is not taken up directly by\nthe liver. It is first metabolized by tissues that have lipoprotein\nlipase , which hydrolyzes the triacylglycerol, releasing fatty acids\nthat are incorporated into tissue lipids or oxidized as fuel. The\nchylomicron remnants are cleared by the liver. The other major\nsource of long-chain fatty acids is synthesis (lipogenesis) from\ncarbohydrate, in adipose tissue and the liver (see Chapter 23).\nAdipose tissue triacylglycerol is the main fuel reserve of the\nbody. It is hydrolyzed (lipolysis) and glycerol and nonesteri-\nfied (free) fatty acids are released into the circulation.

Ketone bodies are exported to\nextrahepatic tissues, where they provide an alternative fuel in\nprolonged fasting and starvation.\nSkeletal muscle\u2019s primary fuel is fatty acids in the fasted\nsetting. In the fed state muscle glucose uptake increases markedly\nas its preferred substrate fatty acid decreases (see Figure 14\u20131).\nThe glucose is oxidized to CO2(aer obic) or anaerobically con-\nverted to lactate. A large fraction (>50%) is stored as glycogen\nin the fed state. Skeletal muscle synthesizes muscle protein from\nplasma amino acids. Muscle accounts for approximately 50% of\nbody mass and consequently represents a considerable store of\nprotein that can be drawn upon to supply amino acids for gluco-\nneogenesis and be oxidized in skeletal muscle in starvation (see\nChapter 19). In long term fasting ketones can be a significant\ncontributor to muscle substrate oxidation.\nAt the Subcellular Level, Glycolysis\nOccurs \nin the Cytosol & the Citric Acid\nCycle in the Mitochondria\nCompartmentation of pathways in separate subcellular com-\npartments or o\nrganelles permits integration and regulation of\nmetabolism. Not all pathways are of equal importance in all\ncells. Figure 14\u20138 depicts the subcellular compartmentation\nof metabolic pathways in a liver parenchymal cell.\nThe liver performs many anabolic processes simultane-\nously (gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, VLDL synthesis, and\nprotein synthesis) each of these are energy requiring (ATP ,\nNADH, NADPH). The central role of the mitochondrion is\nimmediately apparent, since it acts as the focus of carbohy-\ndrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism as well as a site for\ngeneration of energy to support these processes. It contains the\nenzymes of the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 16), \u03b2-oxidation\nof fatty acids and ketogenesis (see Chapter 22), as well as the\nrespiratory chain and ATP synthase (see Chapter 13).\nGlycolysis (see Chapter 17), the pentose phosphate pathway\n(see Chapter 20), and fatty acid synthesis (see Chapter 23) all\noccur in the cytosol. Gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 19) requires\nmovement of molecules between cellular compartments. Sub-\nstrates such as lactate and pyruvate, which are formed in the\ncytosol, enter the mitochondrion to yield oxaloacetate that then\nhas to be moved to the cytosol to generate phosphoenolpyru-\nvate, which serves as a precursor for the synthesis of glucose.\nThe membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum con-\ntain the enzyme system for triacylglycerol synthesis (see\nChapter 24), and the ribosomes are responsible for protein\nsynthesis (see Chapter 37).THE FLUX THROUGH METABOLIC\nP\nATHWAYS MUST BE REGULATED\nIN A CONCERTED MANNER\nRegulation of the overall flux through a pathway is important\nas \nit allows a cell to respond to a changing environment. The\nregulation could be dictated by changes in overall substrates\navailable to the cell as well as by endocrine signals that stimulate\nor inhibit specific metabolic pathways to subserve the needs of\nthe organism. For example, storing glycogen in the liver in the\nfed state and mobilizing it in the fasted setting. This control is\nachieved by one or more key reactions in the pathway catalyzed\nby regulatory enzymes and/or transport systems that shuttle\nmetabolites across the plasma membrane or between intracellu-\nlar compartments. The physicochemical factors that control the\nrate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, such as substrate concen-\ntration, are of primary importance in the control of the overall\nrate of a metabolic pathway (see Chapter 9).\nNonequilibrium Reactions Are\nPot\nential Control Points\nIn a reaction at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions\noccur \nat equal rates, and there is therefore no net flux in either\ndirection.\nA\u2194C\u2194D\nIf this were a closed system and we added a fixed quantity of\n\u201c A \u201d , the reaction would proceed to the right to make \u201cC and\nD\u201d until a new equilibrium was reached where the forward\nand reverse reactions are equal. The final concentration of A,\nC, and D would be determined by the absolute amount of A\nadded and the properties of the enzymes. In vivo , there is a\nnet flux from left to right because there is a continuous sup-\nply of substrate A and continuous removal of product D. The\nin vivo pathway is in a \u201csteady state\u201d if the rates of the reactions\nare constant and the concentration of the substrates, products,\nand intermediates are constant. In practice, there are normally\none or more nonequilibrium reactions in a metabolic path-\nway, where the reactants are present in concentrations that are\nfar from equilibrium. In attempting to reach equilibrium, large\nlosses of free energy occur, making this type of reaction essen-\ntially irreversible. Such a pathway has both flow and direction.\nThe enzymes catalyzing nonequilibrium reactions are usually\npresent in low concentration and are subject to a variety of\nregulatory mechanisms. However, most reactions in metabolic\npathways cannot be classified as equilibrium or nonequilib-\nrium, but fall somewhere between the two extremes.\nThe Control of Flux Through Many\nPath\nways Is Distributed\nThe flux-generating reaction can be identified as a non-\nequilibrium \nreaction in which the Kmof the enzyme is con-\nsiderably lower than the normal concentration of substrate.\nThe first reaction in glycolysis, catalyzed by hexokinase (see\nFigure 17\u20132), would be considered such a flux-generating step"

The flux through this\npathway can be regulated by the availability of substrate A.\nThis depends on its supply from the blood, which in turn\ndepends on either food intake or key reactions that release\nsubstrates from tissue reserves (glycogen and triglycerides)\ninto the bloodstream. For example, glycogen phosphorylase\nin liver (see Figure 18\u20131) can mobilize liver glycogen and\nhormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue can mobilize adi-\npose tissue triglycerides (see Figure 25\u20138). It also depends on\nthe transport of substrate A into the cell. Muscle and adipose\ntissue glucose transport from the bloodstream increases in\nresponse to the hormone insulin.\nFlux is also determined by removal of the end product D\nand the availability of cosubstrates or cofactors. Enzymes cata-\nlyzing nonequilibrium reactions are often allosteric proteins\nsubject to the rapid actions of \u201cfeed-back\u201d or \u201cfeed-forward\u201d\ncontrol by allosteric modifiers , in immediate response to the\nneeds of the cell (see Chapter 9). Frequently, the end product ofa biosynthetic pathway inhibits the enzyme catalyzing the first\nreaction in the pathway. Other control mechanisms depend on\nthe action of hormones responding to the needs of the body as\na whole; they may act rapidly by altering the activity or cellular\nlocalization of existing enzyme molecules or slowly changing\nenzyme content by altering the rate of enzyme synthesis\n(see Chapter 42).\nMANY METABOLIC FUELS\nARE \nINTERCONVERTIBLE\nCarbohydrate in excess of requirements for immediate energy-\nyielding \nmetabolism and formation of glycogen reserves in\nmuscle and liver can readily be used for synthesis of fatty\nacids, and hence triacylglycerol in both adipose tissue and\nliver (whence it is exported in very low-density lipoprotein).\nThe rate of lipogenesis in human beings is dependent on the\ncarbohydrate content of the diet and total caloric intake. In\nWestern countries dietary carbohydrates provide ~50% of\nenergy intake. In less-developed countries, carbohydrate may\nprovide 60 to 75% of energy intake. However, the total intake\nof food is so low that there is little surplus for lipogenesis. A high\nintake of fat inhibits lipogenesis in adipose tissue and liver.\nDespite the relatively higher fat intake in Western countries\nlipogenesis is significant because total caloric intake exceeds\nenergy demand requiring diversion of excess carbohydrate\ncalories to lipogenesis.\nFatty acids (and ketone bodies formed from them) cannot\nbe used for the synthesis of glucose.

This means that acetyl-CoA\n(and \nhence any substrates that yield acetyl-CoA) can never be\nused for gluconeogenesis. The (relatively rare) fatty acids with\nan odd number of carbon atoms yield propionyl-CoA as the\nproduct of the final cycle of \u03b2-oxidation. Propionyl-CoA can\nbe a substrate for gluconeogenesis, as can the glycerol released\nby lipolysis of adipose tissue triacylglycerol reserves.\nMost of the amino acids in excess of requirements for\nprotein synthesis (arising from the diet or from tissue protein\nturnover) yield pyruvate, or four- and five-carbon intermedi-\nates of the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 29). Pyruvate can be\ncarboxylated to oxaloacetate, which is the primary substrate\nfor gluconeogenesis, and the other intermediates of the cycle\nalso result in a net increase in the formation of oxaloacetate,\nwhich is then available for gluconeogenesis. These amino\nacids are classified as glucogenic . Two amino acids (lysine and\nleucine) yield only acetyl-CoA on oxidation, and hence cannot\nbe used for gluconeogenesis, and four others (phenylalanine,\ntyrosine, tryptophan, and isoleucine) give rise to both acetyl-\nCoA and intermediates that can be used for gluconeogenesis.\nThose amino acids that give rise to acetyl-CoA are referred\nto as ketogenic . With prolonged fasting and starvation amino\nacids are mobilized from muscle protein to provide substrates\nfor gluconeogenesis, oxidized by the liver to support liver\nenergy demands, and contribute to synthesis of ketone bodies.\nA SUPPLY OF OXIDIZABLE FUEL\nIS \nPROVIDED IN BOTH THE FED\n& FASTING STATES\nGlucose Is Always Required by the\nCentr\nal Nervous System & Erythrocytes\nErythrocytes lack mitochondria and hence are wholly reliant\non \n(anaerobic) glycolysis and the pentose phosphate path-\nway at all times. The brain normally metabolizes glucose but\ncan metabolize ketone bodies. When ketone availability is\nhigh such as prolonged fasting, they can meet about 20% of\nits energy requirements; the remainder must be supplied by\nglucose. The metabolic changes that occur in the fasting state\nand starvation serve to preserve plasma glucose for use by the\nbrain and red blood cells, and to provide alternative metabolic\n(lipids, amino acids) fuels for other tissues ( Figure 14\u201310 ). In\npregnancy, the fetus requires a significant amount of glucose,\nas does the mammary gland for synthesis of lactose during\nlactation.\nIn the Fed State, the Exogenous\nMetabolic \nFuels Are Both Oxidized\n& Stored\nIn response to a meal typically the caloric intake during the\nperiod \nthe food is absorbed exceeds the energy requirements\nof the organism. The excess calories are stored either as glyco-\ngen or lipid. When substrates are oxidized oxygen is consumedand carbon dioxide is produced. When glucose (C6H12O6) is\noxidized (C6H12O6+ 6O2\u21926CO2+ 6 H2O) for each mole of\nglucose \noxidized a mole of oxygen is consumed and mole of\ncarbon dioxide is released. The molar ratio of CO2produced\nand \nO2consum ed is called the respiratory quotient. For car-\nbohydrates this ratio is one. For fatty acid and protein oxida-\ntion this ratio is less than one ( Table 14\u20131 ). We can measure\nthis ratio in expired air. This is called the respiratory exchange\nratio. This ratio reflects the mixture of substrates being oxi-\ndized by all tissues. In a typical person this ratio averages\n~0.85 in a 24-hour period for a person on a standard diet. For\nseveral hours after a carbohydrate-rich meal, while the prod-\nucts of digestion are being absorbed, there is an abundant sup-\nply of carbohydrate. Thus carbohydrate oxidation is the main\nsubstrate being oxidized so the respiratory exchange ratio\nincreases toward 1. The process of storing excess calories as\nglycogen and lipid is an energy requiring process and is called\nthe thermic effect of food, which can account for ~10% of\ndaily energy expenditure. As a person transitions to a fast the\nrate of glucose oxidation decreases and the rate of fat oxida-\ntion increases (this is observed as a decrease in the respiratory\nexchange ratio toward 0.7 reflecting a shift to fat oxidation; see\nTable 14\u20131).\nGlucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue is con-\ntrolled by insulin , which is secreted by the \u03b2-islet cells of the\npancreas in response to an increased concentration of glucose\nin the arterial blood. In the fasting state, the glucose trans-\nporter of muscle and adipose tissue (GLUT-4) is in intracellular\nvesicles. An early response to insulin is the migration of these\nvesicles to the cell surface, where they fuse with the plasma\nmembrane, exposing active glucose transporters. These insulin-\nsensitive tissues only take up glucose from the bloodstream\nto any significant extent in the presence of the hormone. As\ninsulin secretion falls in the fasting state, the transporters are\ninternalized, reducing glucose uptake. However, in skeletal\nmuscle, the increase in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentra-\ntion in response to nerve stimulation and subsequent muscle\ncontraction stimulates the migration of the vesicles to the cell\nsurface and exposure of active glucose transporters whether\nthere is significant insulin stimulation or not. Thus part of the\nincrease in glucose uptake during exercise is independent of\nan increase in insulin.\nThe transport capacity for glucose into the liver is high\nand is independent of insulin, thus transport does not control\nthe rate of glucose uptake in the liver. The liver, however, has\nan isoenzyme of hexokinase (glucokinase) with a high Km, so\nthat \nas the concentration of glucose increases and enters the\nliver hepatocyte, so does the rate of synthesis of glucose-6-\nphosphate. Thus, when plasma glucose is elevated in the fed\nstate the liver takes up glucose (see Figure 14\u20131). If it is in excess\nof the liver\u2019s requirement for energy-yielding metabolism, it is\nused mainly for synthesis of glycogen . In both liver and skel-\netal muscle, insulin, which increases in response to an increase\nin glucose acts to amplify glycogen synthesis by stimulating\nglycogen synthetase and inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase.\nSome of the additional glucose entering the liver may also be"

Protein synthesis falls during the\nfasting period and increases in the feeding period (a change of\n~20-25%). It is only in cachexia associated with advanced can-\ncer and other diseases that there is an increased rate of protein\ncatabolism. The increased rate of protein synthesis in response to\nincreased availability of amino acids and metabolic fuel is again a\nresponse to insulin. Protein synthesis is an energy expensive pro-\ncess; it may account for up to 20% of resting energy expenditure\nafter a meal, but only 9% in the fasting state.\nMetabolic Fuel Reserves Are Mobilized\nin \nthe Fasting State\nThere is a small fall in plasma glucose in the fasting state, and\nthen \nlittle change as fasting is prolonged into starvation. Plasma\nnonesterified fatty acids increase in fasting, but then rise little\nmore in starvation; as fasting is prolonged, the plasma concen-\ntration of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate)\nincreases markedly ( Table 14\u20132 ,Figure 14\u201311 ).\nIn the fasting state, as the concentration of glucose in the\nportal blood coming from the small intestine falls, insulin\nsecretion decreases, and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue take\nup less glucose. The increase in secretion of glucagon by \u03b1-cells\nof the pancreas inhibits glycogen synthetase, and activates gly-\ncogen phosphorylase in the liver; mobilizing glycogen stores.The resulting glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose-\n6-phosphatase, and glucose is released into the bloodstream for\nuse primarily by the brain and erythrocytes (see Figure 14\u20131).\nMuscle glycogen cannot contribute directly to plasma\nglucose, since muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase, and the\nprimary use of muscle glycogen is to provide a source of\nglucose-6-phosphate and pyruvate potentially for energy-yielding\nmetabolism in the muscle itself. However, acetyl-CoA formed\nby oxidation of fatty acids in muscle inhibits pyruvate dehy-\ndrogenase, leading to an accumulation of pyruvate. Most of\nthis is transaminated to alanine, at the expense of amino acids\narising from breakdown of muscle protein or released as\nlactate. The alanine, lactate, and much of the keto acids result-\ning from this transamination are exported from muscle and are\ntaken up by the liver to support gluconeogenesis. In adipose\ntissue, the decrease in insulin and increase in glucagon results\nin inhibition of lipogenesis, inactivation and internalization\nof lipoprotein lipase, and activation of intracellular hormone-\nsensitive lipase (see Chapter 25). This leads to release from\nadipose tissue of increased amounts of glycerol (which is a\nsubstrate for gluconeogenesis in the liver) and nonesterified\nfatty acids, which are used by liver, heart, and skeletal muscle\nas their preferred metabolic fuel, so sparing glucose.\nAlthough muscle preferentially takes up and metabolizes\nnonesterified fatty acids in the fasting state, it cannot meet all\nof its energy requirements by \u03b2-oxidation. By contrast, the liver\nhas a greater capacity for \u03b2-oxidation than is required to meet\nits own energy needs, and as fasting becomes more prolonged,\nit forms more acetyl-CoA than can be oxidized.

            "Text": "146 SECTION IV Metabolism of Carbohydrates\ncattle and in ewes carrying a twin pregnancy, there may be\nvery \npronounced ketoacidosis and profound hypoglycemia.\nKetogenic diets (low carbohydrate <50 g/day, low protein\nand high fat) are used to treat intractable (failure to obtain\nsustained relief with antiepileptic drugs and are not surgical\ncandidates) epilepsy (~30% of all patients with epilepsy). The\ncarbohydrate intake is well below that needed to support the\nglucose requiring tissues (~6 g/hr \u00d7 24 h =144 g/day); thus\ngluconeogenesis from glucogenic amino acids in the diet\npartially make up the difference. In addition, because of the\nvery low carbohydrate intake and high rate of fat oxidation\nthey develop a mild ketosis. This provides ketone bodies to the\nbrain to support energy requirements not met by glucose; this\ndecreases overall carbohydrate requirements.\nDiabetes (chronic hyperglycemia) affects ~7% of the US\nadult population. The three common forms of diabetes are Type\n1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Type II diabetes (T2DM), and ges-\ntational diabetes. T1DM is a disorder resulting from a chronic\nautoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic\nbeta cells resulting in a near complete loss of insulin secretion.\nThe predominant form of diabetes T2DM accounts for 90 to 95%\nof cases, is due to a combination of factors that impair both the\nsensitivity of tissues to insulin (ie, insulin resistance) and insulin\nsecretion. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. It affects\n7 to 10% of all pregnancies. Inadequate diabetes management can\nlead to organ dysfunction including blindness, renal and cardio-\nvascular diseases, and in the case of gestational diabetes it can\nlead to fetal complications. Thus, tissue metabolism can adapt to\nphysiologic events to preserve metabolic health of the organism.\nThis adaptation requires the neuroendocrine systems that con-\ntrols inter- and intra- organ nutrient homeostasis are intact.\nIn poorly controlled diabetes mellitus , patients may\nbecome severely hyperglycemic as a result of lack of or inad-\nequate insulin secretion to restrain hepatic glucose production\nin the fasted state and impaired stimulation uptake of glucose\nby hepatic and peripheral tissues in the fed state. The severe\nhyperglycemia can progress to diabetic ketoacidosis which is\na medical emergency. In the absence of insulin to antagonize\nthe actions of glucagon and restrain the delivery of amino acids\nfrom muscle to the liver further fuels gluconeogenesis. At the\nsame time, lipolysis in adipose tissue unrestrained by insulin\nand amplified by the increased sympathetic nervous system\nactivity and glucagon, increases fatty acid delivery to the liver.\nThe relative excess of glucagon, a potent stimulator of keto-\ngenesis, synergizes with the increase in fatty acid supply to\nmarkedly increase ketone body formation. Utilization of the\nketone bodies in muscle (and other tissues) may be impaired\nbecause of the lack of oxaloacetate (all tissues have a require-\nment for some glucose metabolism to maintain an adequate\namount of oxaloacetate for citric acid cycle activity). This will\namplify the increase in circulating ketones; ketone bodies\n(acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) are relatively strong\nacids. Coma results from both the acidosis and the consider-\nably increased osmolality of extracellular fluid and dehydration\n(mainly as a result of the hyperglycemia, and diuresis resulting\nfrom the excretion of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine).SUMMARY\n\u25a0The products of digestion provide the tissues with the building\nblocks f\nor the biosynthesis of complex molecules and also with\nthe fuel for metabolic processes.\n\u25a0Nearly all products of digestion of carbohydrate, fat, and\npro\ntein are metabolized to a common metabolite, acetyl-CoA,\nbefore oxidation to CO2in the citric acid cycle.\n\u25a0Acetyl-CoA is the precursor for synthesis of long-chain fatty\nacids, st\neroids (including cholesterol), and ketone bodies.\n\u25a0Glucose provides carbon skeletons for the glycerol of\ntriacy\nlglycerols and nonessential amino acids.\n\u25a0Water-soluble products of digestion are transported directly\nto the \nliver via the hepatic portal vein. The liver regulates the\nconcentrations of glucose and amino acids available to other\ntissues. Lipids and lipid-soluble products of digestion enter the\nbloodstream from the lymphatic system, and the liver clears the\nremnants after extrahepatic tissues have taken up fatty acids.\n\u25a0Pathways are compartmentalized within the cell. Glycolysis,\nglycogenesis, \nglycogenolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway,\nand lipogenesis occur in the cytosol. The mitochondria contain\nthe enzymes of the citric acid cycle and for \u03b2-oxidation of fatty\nacids, as well as the respiratory chain and ATP synthase. The\nmembranes of the endoplasmic reticulum contain the enzymes\nfor a number of other processes, including triacylglycerol\nsynthesis and drug metabolism.\n\u25a0Metabolic pathways are regulated by rapid mechanisms\naffecting the \nactivity of existing enzymes, that is, allosteric and\ncovalent modification (often in response to hormone action)\nand slow mechanisms that affect the synthesis of enzymes.\n\u25a0Dietary carbohydrate and amino acids in excess of requirements\ncan\n be used for fatty acid and hence triacylglycerol synthesis.\n\u25a0In fasting and starvation, glucose must be provided for the brain\nan\nd red blood cells; in the early fasting state, this is supplied from\nglycogen reserves. In order to spare glucose, muscle and other\ntissues do not take up glucose when insulin secretion is low; they\nutilize fatty acids (and later ketone bodies) as their preferred fuel.\n\u25a0Adipose tissue releases nonesterified fatty acids in the fasting\nstate\n. In prolonged fasting and starvation, these are used by the\nliver for synthesis of ketone bodies, which along with the fatty\nacids provide the major fuel for muscle.\n\u25a0Many of the amino acids, arising from the diet or from tissue\npro\ntein turnover, can be used for gluconeogenesis, as can the\nglycerol from triacylglycerol.\n\u25a0Neither fatty acids, arising from the diet or from lipolysis of adipose\nti\nssue triacylglycerol, nor ketone bodies, formed from fatty acids in\nthe fasting state, can provide substrates for gluconeogenesis.\nREFERENCES\nFrayn KN.The glucose-fatty acid cycle: a physiological\nperspective .Biochem Soc Trans 2003;31(Pt 6):1115-1119.\nHall \nKD, Heymsfield SB, Kemnitz JW , Klein S, Schoeller DA,\nSpeakman JR.

The \ue031irection of rotation\nof po\ue039arize\ue031 \ue039ight is in\ue031epen\ue031ent of the stereochemistry of\nthe sugar, so it may be \ue031esignate\ue031 d(\u2212), d(+), l(\u2212), or l(+).\nFor examp\ue039e, the natura\ue039\ue039y occurring form of fructose is the\nd(\u2212) isomer. Confusing\ue039y, \ue031extrorotatory (+) was at one\ntime ca\ue039\ue039e\ue031 \ue031-, an\ue031 \ue039evorotatory (\u2212) \ue039-. This nomenc\ue039ature\nis obso\ue039ete, but may sometimes be foun\ue031; it is unre\ue039ate\ue031 to\nd- an\ue031 l-isomerism. In so\ue039ution, g\ue039ucose is \ue031extrorotatory,\nan\ue031 g\ue039ucose so\ue039utions are sometimes known as dextrose .\n3. Pyranose and furanose ring structures: The ring struc-\ntures of monosacchari\ue031es are simi\ue039ar to the ring structures\nof either pyran (a six-membere\ue031 ring) or furan (a five-\nmembere\ue031 ring) ( Figures 15\u20133 an\ue03115\u20134 ). For g\ue039ucose in\nso\ue039ution, more than 99% is in the pyranose form.4. Alpha- and beta-anomers: The ring structure of an a\ue039\ue031ose is a\nhemiaceta\ue039, since it is forme\ue031 by reaction between an a\ue039\ue031ehy\ue031e\nan\ue031 an a\ue039coho\ue039 group. Simi\ue039ar\ue039y, the ring structure of a ketose\nis a hemiketa\ue039. Crysta\ue039\ue039ine g\ue039ucose is \u03b1-d-g\ue039ucopyranose.\nThe cyc\ue039ic structure is retaine\ue031 in the so\ue039ution, but isomer-\nism occurs about position 1, the carbony\ue039 or anomeric car-\nbon atom , to give a mixture of \u03b1-g\ue039ucopyranose (38%) an\ue031\n\u03b2-g\ue039ucopyranose (62%). Less than 0.3% is represente\ue031 by\n\u03b1- an\ue031 \u03b2-anomers of g\ue039ucofuranose.\n5. Epimers: Isomers \ue031iffering as a resu\ue039t of variations in configu-\nration of the \u2014OH an\ue031 \u2014H on carbon atoms 2, 3, an\ue031 4 of\ng\ue039ucose are known as epimers. Bio\ue039ogica\ue039\ue039y, the most impor-\ntant epimers of g\ue039ucose are mannose (epimerize\ue031 at carbon 2)\nan\ue031 ga\ue039actose (epimerize\ue031 at carbon 4) ( Figure 15\u20135 ).\n6. Aldose-ketose isomerism: Fructose has the same mo\ue039ecu-\n\ue039ar formu\ue039a as g\ue039ucose but \ue031iffers in that there is a potentia\ue039\nketo group in position 2, the anomeric carbon of fructose,\nwhereas in g\ue039ucose there is a potentia\ue039 a\ue039\ue031ehy\ue031e group\nin position 1, the anomeric carbon. Examp\ue039es of a\ue039\ue031ose\nan\ue031 ketose sugars are shown in Figures 15\u20136 an\ue03115\u20137 ,\nrespective\ue039y.

It also has a central role\nin gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and interconversion of amino\nacids. Many of these processes occur in most tissues, but liver\nis the only tissue in which all occur to a significant extent. The\nrepercussions are therefore profound when, for example, large\nnumbers of hepatic cells are damaged as in acute hepatitis or\nreplaced by connective tissue (as in cirrhosis ). The few genetic\ndefects of citric acid cycle enzymes that have been reportedare associated with severe neurologic damage as a result of\nimpaired ATP formation in the central nervous system.\nHyperammonemia, as occurs in advanced liver disease,\nleads to loss of consciousness, coma, and convulsions. The\nimpaired activity of the citric acid cycle leads to reduced for-\nmation of ATP .

During\nthe oxidation of acetyl-CoA, coenzymes are reduced, then\nreoxidized in the respiratory chain, linked to the formation\nof ATP (oxidative phosphorylation, Figure 16\u20132 ; see also\nChapter 13). This process is aerobic , requiring oxygen as\nthe final oxidant of the reduced coenzymes. The enzymes of\nthe citric acid cycle are located in the mitochondrial matrix ,\neither free or attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane\nand the crista membrane. This is where the enzymes and coen-\nzymes of the respiratory chain are also found (see Chapter 13).\nTo sustain the cycle, the number of carbons entering and\nleaving must be equal. A two-carbon molecule (Acetyl-CoA)\ncombines with a four-carbon molecule (oxaloacetate) to form a\nsix-carbon molecule (citrate). After one turn of the cycle citrate\nis converted back to oxaloacetate and two carbons are released\nas CO2. If a metabolic pathway adds carbon to the cycle that is\nnot \nthough acetyl-CoA (pyruvate [C3] to oxaloacetate [C4] for\ngluconeogenesis; see Chapter 19) then there must be an outlet\npathway to bring an equal amount of carbon out (oxaloacetate\n[C4] to phosphoenolpyruvate [C3]) of the cycle. The entry of\ncarbon is called anaplerosis . The exiting of carbon is called\ncataplerosis . Thus to sustain the citric acid cycle anaplerosis\nmust equal cataplerosis.\nREACTIONS OF THE CITRIC ACID\nCY\nCLE GENERATE REDUCING\nEQUIVALENTS & CO2\nThe initial reaction between acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate\n(C4) \nto form citrate (C6) is catalyzed by citrate synthase ,\nwhich forms a carbon\u2013carbon bond between the methyl car-\nbon of acetyl-CoA and the carbonyl carbon of oxaloacetate(Figure 16\u20133 ). The thioester bond of the resultant citryl-CoA\nis hydrolyzed, releasing citrate and CoASH\u2014an exothermic\nreaction. The coenzyme A released can be recycled in the con-\nversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydroge-\nnase complex.\nCitrate is isomerized to isocitrate by the enzyme aconi-\ntase (aconitate hydratase); the reaction occurs in two steps:\ndehydration to cis-aconitate and rehydration to isocitrate.\nAlthough citrate is a symmetrical molecule, aconitase reacts\nwith citrate asymmetrically, so that the two carbon atoms that\nare lost in subsequent reactions of the cycle are not those that\nwere added from acetyl-CoA. This asymmetric behavior is\nthe result of channeling \u2014transfer of the product of citrate\nsynthase directly onto the active site of aconitase, withoutOxaloacetate\n(C4)Citrate\n(C6)Acetyl-CoA\n(C2)\nCoA\nCO2CO2\nFIGURE 16\u20131 The citric acid cycle, illustrating the impor-\ntance \nof regenerating oxaloacetate to sustain the cycle.\nFIGURE 16\u20132 The citric acid cycle: the major catabolic\npathway \nfor acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA, the product of carbohydrate,\nprotein, and lipid catabolism, enters the cycle by forming citrate, and\nis oxidized to CO2with the reduction of coenzymes. Reoxidation of\nthe coenzymes in the respiratory chain leads to phosphorylation of\nADP to ATP . For one turn of the cycle, nine ATP are generated via oxi-\ndative phosphorylation and one ATP (or GTP) arises at substrate level\nfrom the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate."

As fatty acid synthesis uses an anaple-\nroti\nc pathway (pyruvate carboxylase) to add oxaloacetate to the\ncycle, this in turn will make extra citrate and thus isocitrate.\nThe excess isocitrate will act as a break on aconitase. Because\nof channeling, citrate is only available in free solution to be\ntransported from the mitochondria to the cytosol for fatty acid\nsynthesis when aconitase is inhibited by accumulation of its\nproduct, isocitrate. The \u201cfree\u201d citrate can then be exported outof the cycle (cataplerosis) to be a source of acetyl-CoA for fatty\nacid synthesis. This allows citric acid cycle activity to be main-\ntained to generate ATP and reducing equivalents. This energy\nwill be needed to support the energy demanding process of\nfatty acid synthesis while providing citrate in the cytosol as a\nsource of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis.\nThe poison fluoroacetate is found in some of the plants,\nand their consumption can be fatal to grazing animals. SomeFIGURE 16\u20133 The citric acid (Krebs) cycle. Oxidation of NADH and FADH2in the respiratory chain leads to the formation of ATP via oxi-\ndative phosphorylation. In order to follow the passage of acetyl-CoA through the cycle, the two carbon atoms of the acetyl moiety are shown\nlabeled on the carboxyl carbon ( *) and on the methyl carbon ( \u00b7). Although two carbon atoms are lost as CO2in one turn of the cycle, these atoms\nare not derived from the acetyl-CoA that has immediately entered the cycle, but from that portion of the citrate molecule that was derived from\noxaloacetate. However, on completion of a single turn of the cycle, the oxaloacetate that is regenerated is now labeled, which leads to labeled\nCO2being evolved during the second turn of the cycle. Because succinate is a symmetrical compound, \u201crandomization\u201d of label occurs at this\nstep so that all four carbon atoms of oxaloacetate appear to be labeled after one turn of the cycle. During gluconeogenesis, some of the label in\noxaloacetate is incorporated into glucose and glycogen (see Figure 20\u20131). The sites of inhibition ( \u229d) by fluoroacetate, malonate, and arsenite are\nindicated."

It is toxic because fluoroacetyl-CoA condenses with\noxaloacetate to form fluorocitrate, which inhibits aconitase,\ncausing citrate to accumulate.\nIsocitrate undergoes dehydrogenation catalyzed by isoci-\ntrate dehydrogenase to form, initially, oxalosuccinate, which\nremains enzyme bound and undergoes decarboxylation to\n\u03b1-ketoglutarate. The decarboxylation requires Mg2+or Mn2+\nions. There ar\ne three isoenzymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase.\nOne, which uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+),\nis f\nound only in mitochondria. The other two use NADP+and\nare \nfound in mitochondria and the cytosol. Respiratory chain\u2013\nlinked oxidation of isocitrate occurs through the NAD+-\ndependent \nenzyme.\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation\nin a reaction catalyzed by a multienzyme complex similar to\nthat involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate (see\nFigure 17\u20135). The \u03b1 -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex\nrequires the same cofactors as the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex\u2014thiamin diphosphate, lipoate, NAD+, flavin adenine\ndinucleotide \n(FAD), and CoA\u2014and results in the formation\nof succinyl-CoA. The equilibrium of this reaction is so much\nin favor of succinyl-CoA formation that it must be considered\nto be physiologically unidirectional. As in the case of pyru-\nvate oxidation (see Chapter 17), arsenite inhibits the reac-\ntion, causing the substrate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate , to accumulate.\nHigh concentrations of ammonia seen in liver disease inhibits\n\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.\nSuccinyl-CoA is converted to succinate by the enzyme\nsuccinate thiokinase (succinyl-CoA synthetase) . This is the\nonly example of substrate-level phosphorylation (transfer of a\nphosphate group bound to the enzyme to GDP or ADP with\ngeneration of ATP or GTP) in the citric acid cycle. Tissues in\nwhich gluconeogenesis occurs (the liver and kidney) contain\ntwo isoenzymes of succinate thiokinase, one specific for GDP\nand the other for ADP . The GTP formed is used for the decar-\nboxylation of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluco-\nneogenesis, and provides a regulatory link between citric acid\ncycle activity and the withdrawal (cataplerosis) of oxaloacetate\nfor gluconeogenesis. Nongluconeogenic tissues have only the\nisoenzyme that phosphorylates ADP .\nWhen ketone bodies are being metabolized in extrahepatic\ntissues, there is an alternative reaction catalyzed by succinyl-\nCoA\u2013acetoacetate-CoA transferase (thiophorase) , involving\ntransfer of CoA from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate, forming\nacetoacetyl-CoA and succinate (see Chapter 22).\nThe onward metabolism of succinate, leading to the\nregeneration of oxaloacetate, is the same sequence of chemical\nreactions as occurs in the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids: dehydro-\ngenation to form a carbon\u2013carbon double bond, addition of\nwater to form a hydroxyl group, and a further dehydrogena-\ntion to yield the oxo-group of oxaloacetate.\nThe first dehydrogenation reaction, forming fumarate,\nis catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase , which is bound tothe inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The\nenzyme contains FAD and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein, and\ndirectly reduces ubiquinone in the electron transport chain.\nFumarase (fumarate hydratase) catalyzes the addition of\nwater across the double bond of fumarate, yielding malate.\nMalate is oxidized to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase ,\nlinked to the reduction of NAD+to form NADH. Although the\nequilibrium of this reaction strongly favors malate, the net flux\nis to oxaloacetate because oxaloacetate is rapidly being used.\nOxaloacetate is used for multiple reactions (form citrate, leave\nthe mitochondria to be a substrate for gluconeogenesis, or to\nundergo transamination to form aspartate). NADH is reoxi-\ndized to NAD by the respiratory chain.\nTEN ATP ARE FORMED PER TURN\nOF \nTHE CITRIC ACID CYCLE\nAs a result of oxidations catalyzed by the dehydrogenases of\nthe \ncitric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH and one of\nFADH2are produced for each molecule of acetyl-CoA catabo-\nlized in one turn of the cycle. These reducing equivalents are\ntransferred to the respiratory chain (see Figure 13\u20133), where\nreoxidation of each NADH results in formation of ~2.5 ATP ,\nand of FADH2, ~1.5 ATP . In addition, 1 ATP (or GTP) is\nformed \nby substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by suc-\ncinate thiokinase.\nVITAMINS PLAY KEY ROLES\nIN \nTHE CITRIC ACID CYCLE\nFour of the B vitamins (see Chapter 44) are essential in the\ncitric acid cycle and hence ener\ngy-yielding metabolism: ribo-\nflavin , as FAD, is the cofactor for succinate dehydrogenase;\nniacin, as NAD+, is the electron acceptor for isocitrate dehy-\ndrogenase, \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehy-\ndrogenase; thiamin (vitamin B1), as thiamin diphosphate,\nis the coenzyme for decarboxylation in the \u03b1-ketoglutarate\ndehydrogenase reaction; and pantothenic acid , as part of\ncoenzyme A, is esterified to carboxylic acids to form acetyl-\nCoA and succinyl-CoA.\nTHE CITRIC ACID CYCLE PLAYS\nA \nPIVOTAL ROLE IN METABOLISM\nThe citric acid cycle is not only a pathway for oxidation of two\ncarbon units, \nbut is also a major pathway for interconversion\nof metabolites arising from transamination anddeamination\nof amino acids (see Chapters 28 and 29), and providing the\nsubstrates for amino acid synthesis by transamination (see\nChapter 27), as well as for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 19)\nandfatty acid synthesis (see Chapter 23).

The key enzyme that catalyzes\ntransfer out of the cycle into gluconeogenesis is phosphoenol-\npyruvate carboxykinase , which catalyzes the decarboxylation\nof oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, with GTP acting as\nthe phosphate donor (see Figure 19\u20131). The GTP required for\nthis reaction is provided by the GDP-dependent isoenzyme of\nsuccinate thiokinase. This ensures that oxaloacetate will not be\nwithdrawn from the cycle for gluconeogenesis unless GTP was\nsupplied. Otherwise this would lead to depletion of citric acid\ncycle intermediates, and hence reduced generation of ATP .\nNet transfer into the cycle (ie, anaplerosis) occurs as a\nresult of several reactions. Among the most important of such\nanaplerotic reactions is the formation of oxaloacetate by the\ncarboxylation of pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase\n(see Figure 16\u20134). This reaction is important in maintaining\nan adequate concentration of oxaloacetate for the condensa-\ntion reaction with acetyl-CoA. If acetyl-CoA accumulates,\nit acts as both an allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylaseand an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby ensur-\ning a supply of oxaloacetate.

This\nensures \nthat citrate is used for fatty acid synthesis only when\nthere is an adequate amount to ensure continued activity of the\ncycle. The identity and regulation of the many mitochondrial\ntransport systems (eg, malate, citrate, pyruvate) involved in\ncataplerosis and anaplerosis pathways are poorly understood,\nbut they likely play a critical regulatory role in these pathways.\nThe oxaloacetate released by citrate lyase cannot reenter\nthe mitochondrion, but is reduced to malate, at the expense of\nNADH, and the malate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation\nto pyruvate, reducing NADP+to N ADPH. This reaction, cata-\nlyzed by the malic enzyme, is the source of half the NADPH\nrequired for fatty acid synthesis (the remainder is provided\nby the pentose phosphate pathway; see Chapter 20). Pyruvate\nenters the mitochondrion and is carboxylated to oxaloacetate\nby pyruvate carboxylase, an ATP-dependent reaction in which\nthe coenzyme is the vitamin biotin.\nRegulation of the Citric Acid Cycle\nDepends \nPrimarily on a Supply\nof Oxidized Cofactors\nIn most tissues, where the primary role of the citric acid cycle\nis \nin energy-yielding metabolism, respiratory control via the\nrespiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation regulates citric\nacid cycle activity (see Chapter 13). Thus, cycle activity is imme-\ndiately dependent on the supply of NAD+, which in turn, because\nof\n the tight coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation, is\ndependent on the availability of ADP and hence, ultimately on\nthe utilization of ATP in chemical and physical work. Thus as\nATP usage increases (eg, muscle contraction) this will gener-\nate ADP to help drive the cycle. If ATP demand is low the cycle\nwill slow down to match the demand. In addition, individual\nenzymes of the cycle are regulated. In general these regulatory\nevents help to couple rapid changes in energy demand with citric\nacid cycle flux. The main sites for regulation are the nonequi-\nlibrium reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate\nsynthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehy-\ndrogenase. The dehydrogenases are activated by Ca2+, which\nin\ncreases in concentration during contraction of muscle and\nduring secretion by other tissues, when there is increased energy\ndemand. In a tissue such as brain, which is largely dependent on\nglucose to supply acetyl-CoA, control of the citric acid cycle may\noccur at pyruvate dehydrogenase.\nSeveral enzymes are also responsive to the energy status\nas reflected by the [ATP]/[ADP] and [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios.Thus, there is allosteric inhibition of citrate synthase by ATP\nand long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. Allosteric activation of mito-\nchondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase by ADP\nis counteracted by ATP and NADH. The \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehy-\ndrogenase complex is regulated in the same way as is pyruvate\ndehydrogenase (see Figure 17\u20136). Succinate dehydrogenase is\ninhibited by oxaloacetate, and the availability of oxaloacetate\nis controlled by malate dehydrogenase and depends on the\n[NADH]/[NAD+] ratio. Since the Kmof citrate synthase for\noxaloacetate is of the same order of magnitude as the intrami-\ntochondrial concentration, it is likely that the concentration of\noxaloacetate controls the rate of citrate formation.\nHyperammonemia , as occurs in advanced liver disease and\na number of (rare) genetic diseases of amino acid metabolism,\nleads to loss of consciousness, coma and convulsions, and may\nbe fatal. This is largely because of the withdrawal (cataplerosis)\nof \u03b1-ketoglutarate to form glutamate (catalyzed by glutamate\ndehydrogenase) and then glutamine (catalyzed by glutamine\nsynthetase) from the citric acid cycle, which is not matched by\nanaplerosis. It lowers concentrations of all citric acid cycle inter-\nmediates, citric acid cycle flux, and the generation of ATP . The\nequilibrium of glutamate dehydrogenase is finely poised, and\nthe direction of reaction depends on the ratio of NAD+:NADH\nan\nd the concentration of ammonium ions, which is elevated\nin liver disease. In addition, ammonia inhibits \u03b1-ketoglutarate\ndehydrogenase, and possibly also pyruvate dehydrogenase fur-\nther decreasing citric acid cycle flux.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0The citric acid cycle is the final pathway for the oxidation\nof \ncarbohydrate, lipid, and protein. Their common end-\nmetabolite, acetyl-CoA, reacts with oxaloacetate to form\ncitrate. By a series of dehydrogenations and decarboxylations,\ncitrate is degraded, reducing coenzymes, releasing two CO2,\nand \nregenerating oxaloacetate.\n\u25a0The reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the respiratory chain\nlinked to \nformation of ATP . Thus, the cycle is the major\npathway for the formation of ATP . It is located in the matrix of\nmitochondria adjacent to the enzymes of the respiratory chain\nand oxidative phosphorylation.\n\u25a0The citric acid cycle is amphibolic, since in addition to\noxida\ntion it is important in the provision of carbon skeletons\nfor gluconeogenesis, acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and\ninterconversion of amino acids. For these processes to be\nsustained they rely on a balance of anaplerosis and cataplerosis\nin the citric acid cycle."

Glycolysis is the main\npathway through which cells metabolize glucose and other\ncarbohydrates. It occurs in the cytosol of cells and can func-\ntion either aerobically or anaerobically depending on the\navailability of oxygen and the activity of the electron trans-\nport chain (and hence of the presence of mitochondria).\nErythrocytes, which lack mitochondria, are completely reli-\nant on glucose as their metabolic fuel, and metabolize it by\nanaerobic glycolysis.\nThe ability of glycolysis to provide ATP in the absence of\noxygen allows skeletal muscle to perform at very high levels of\nwork output when oxygen supply is insufficient, and it allows\ntissues to survive anoxic episodes. However, heart muscle,\nwhich is adapted for aerobic performance, has relatively low\nglycolytic activity and poor survival under conditions of isch-\nemia . Diseases in which enzymes of glycolysis (eg, pyruvate\nkinase) are deficient are mainly seen as hemolytic anemias\nor, if the defect affects skeletal muscle (eg, phosphofructo-\nkinase), as fatigue . In fast-growing cancer cells, glycolysis\nproceeds at a high rate, forming large amounts of pyruvate,\nwhich is reduced to lactate and released. The lactate is used\nfor gluconeogenesis in the liver (see Chapter 19) and com-\nbined with the marked increase in hepatic protein synthesis\nsecondary to the increased delivery of amino acids from the\ncatabolic muscle contributes to the hypermetabolism seen in\ncancer cachexia .Lactic acidosis can be of two types. Type Ais the most common and is due to impaired tissue perfusion\nor hypoxia (eg, sepsis and hypovolemia). Type B is due to the\nimpaired ability to metabolize lactate (eg, liver disease, thia-\nmine deficiency). Thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency impairs the\nactivity o\nf pyruvate dehydrogenase.\nGLYCOLYSIS CAN FUNCTION\nUNDER \nANAEROBIC CONDITIONS\nEarly in the investigations of glycolysis, it was realized that\nfermentation \nin yeast was similar to the breakdown of gly-\ncogen in muscle. When a muscle contracts under anaerobic\nconditions, glycogen disappears andlactate appears . When\noxygen is made available, aerobic recovery takes place and\nlactate is no longer produced. If muscle contraction occurs\nunder aerobic conditions, lactate does not accumulate as\npyruvate and NADH, the products of glycolysis. Pyruvate and\nNADH can enter the mitochondria where they are oxidized\nfurther to CO2,H2O, and NAD ( Figure 17\u20131 ). When oxy-\ngen is in short supply, mitochondrial reoxidation of NADH\nformed during glycolysis is impaired. As there is a limited\nsupply of NAD to sustain glycolysis the NADH has to be\nreoxidized. The NADH is reoxidized by reducing pyruvate to\nlactate. This allows NAD to be available for the early steps\nin the pathway, so permitting glycolysis to continue. While\nglycolysis can occur under anaerobic conditions, this has a\nprice. It limits the amount of ATP formed per mole of glucose\noxidized, so that much more glucose must be metabolized\nunder anaerobic than aerobic conditions to supply the same\nquantity of ATP to supply cellular work ( Table 17\u20131 ). In yeast\nand some other microorganisms, pyruvate formed in anaero-\nbic glycolysis is not reduced to lactate, but is decarboxylated\nand reduced to form ethanol.O B J E C T I V E S\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou \nshould be able to:\u25a0Describe the pathway of glycolysis and its control, and explain how glycolysis\ncan \noperate under anaerobic conditions.\n\u25a0Describe the reaction of pyruvate dehydrogenase and its regulation.\n\u25a0Explain how inhibition of pyruvate oxidation leads to lactic acidosis.17Glycolysis & the Oxidation\nof\n Pyruvate\nOwen P .

            "Text": "CHAPTER 17 Glycolysis & the Oxidation of Pyruvate 165\nIn \nmuscle and adipose tissue, the transport of glucose is\nstimulated by insulin. In muscle glucose is used for glycoly-\nsis (or glycogen synthesis; see Chapter 18). In adipose tissue,\nit is used for lipogenesis (see Chapter 23). The hexokinase\nexpressed in most tissues has a high affinity (low Km) for\nglucose \nand is allosterically inhibited by its product glucose-\n6-phosphate. When transport activity is low, transport acts\nas a barrier to glucose uptake. Thus transport activity is an\nimportant determinant of the overall rate of glycolysis. The\ncombined effect of a low transport activity and the high affinity\nof hexokinase for glucose keeps the intracellular glucose very\nlow. Thus, the concentration of plasma glucose and the cellu-\nlar ATP demand are the primary determinants of glycolysis in\nan aerobic environment. In the presence of insulin transport\nactivity increases, thus lowering the barrier to glucose entry.\nIf, for example, transport activity increased 10-fold glycolysis\nwill not increase 10-fold because the consequent increase in\nglucose-6-phosphate would serve as a brake on hexokinase\nto limit the overall rate of glycolysis. This effectively shifts\nthe control of glycolysis to pathways (eg, pyruvate oxidation)\ndownstream of hexokinase. In muscle, hexokinase is found\nbound to the outer mitochondrial membrane. As hexokinase\nrequires ATP , it creates a coupling between hexokinase activity\nand mitochondrial ATP generation.In the liver transport activity is not regulated and a dif-\nferent isozyme of hexokinase is expressed ( glucokinase ).\nGlucokinase has a Kmhigher than the normal plasma con-\ncentration of glucose and it is not inhibited by its product\nglucose-6-phosphate. Because of the relatively high constitu-\ntive glucose transport activity and the low affinity of glucoki-\nnase for glucose, the intracellular glucose in the liver is very\nsimilar to plasma glucose. The liver can be both a consumer\nand producer of glucose (feasting vs fasting; see Chapter 14).\nIn contrast to most tissues the liver also expresses glucose-\n6-phosphatase, which allows the liver in the fasting state to\ndephosphorylate glucose-6-phosphate generated by the liver\nand release glucose. In the fed state the function of glucokinase\nin the liver is to remove glucose from the hepatic portal blood\nfollowing a meal; this limits the quantity of glucose available\nto peripheral tissues. Glucokinase in the fasted setting is found\ninactive in the nucleus bound to a glucokinase regulatory\nprotein. In response to signals during a meal it leaves the\nnucleus and resides in the cytosol where it is active. Because of\nthe high capacity of glucokinase to phosphorylate glucose\nand the increase in glucose in the portal vein during a meal, it\nprovides more glucose-6-phosphate than is required for liver\nglucose oxidation, thus a large fraction is used for glycogen\nsynthesis and a smaller amount is used for lipogenesis.HC\nHCO\nOH\nCH HO\nHC\n OH\nHC  OH\nCH 2OHHC\nHCO\nOH\nCH HO\nHC OH\nHC OH\nCH 2O\nPCH 2OH\nC\nCH HO\nHC\n OH\nHC  OH\nCH 2O  POCH 2O\nC\nCH HO\nHC\n OH\nHC  OH\nCH 2O  POPCH 2O\nC\nCH 2OHOP\nCH2O\nHCP\nOH\nHC O\nCH 2O\nHCP\nOH\nCOO\n PATP  ADPHexokinase,\nglucokinase\nH3PO 4\n*Glucose\n6-phosphata\nsePhosphohexose\nisomerase\nATP  ADP\nH3PO 4Phosphofructokinase\nFructose\nbisphosphataseAldolaseDihydroxyacetone\nphosphate\nTriose\nphosphate\nisomerase\nGlyceralde\nhyde-\n3-phosphate\nCH 2O\nHCP\nOH\nCOOHCH 2OH\nHC\n O\nCOOHPCH 2\nC  O\nCOOHP C  OHO C O\nCOOHCH 3\nCOOHCH3NAD+\nNADHH3PO 4\nGlyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate\ndehydrogenas\neGlucose Glucose-6-phosphate Fructose-6-phosphate  Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate\nATP ADP ATP NAD+NADH ADP\nBisphosphoglycer\natePhosphoglycerate\nkinasePhosphoglyceromutase Enolase Pyruvate kinase Lactate dehydrogenase\n2-Phosphoglycerate  3-Phosphoglycerate Phosphoenolpyruvate Pyruvate Lactate2 \u00d7 3 carbon sugar molecules per glucoseGlycogen\nGlucose-1-phosphate\nFIGURE 17\u20132 The pathway of glycolysis.

When glucose is increased more glu-\ncose is phosphorylated by glucokinase, increasing glycolysis,\nand leading to increased formation of ATP . The increase in\nATP leads to closure of an ATP sensitive potassium channel,\ncausing membrane depolarization and opening of a voltage-\ngated calcium channel. The resultant influx of calcium ions\nleads to fusion of the insulin secretory granules with the cell\nmembrane and the release of insulin.\nGlucose-6-phosphate is an important compound at the junc-\ntion of several metabolic pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis\n(see Chapter 19), the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 20),\nglycogenesis, and glycogenolysis (see Chapter 18). In glycolysis, it\nis converted to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphohexose isomer-\nase, which involves an aldose\u2013ketose isomerization. This reaction\nis followed by another phosphorylation catalyzed by the enzyme\nphosphofructokinase (phosphofructokinase-1) forming fructose\n1,6-bisphosphate. The phosphofructokinase reaction is irrevers-\nible under physiologic conditions. Phosphofructokinase is both\ninducible and subject to allosteric regulation, and has a major role\nin regulating the rate of glycolysis. Note up to this point in the path-\nway no ATP is generated; ATP is only being consumed. Fructose\n1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved by aldolase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate\naldolase) into two triose phosphates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\nand dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which are interconverted by\nthe enzyme phosphotriose isomerase .Glycolysis continues with the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and the formation of\nNADH. The enzyme catalyzing this oxidation, glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase , is NAD dependent. Structur-\nally, it consists of four identical polypeptides (monomers)\nforming a tetramer. Four \u2014SH groups are present on each\npolypeptide, derived from cysteine residues within the poly-\npeptide chain. One of the \u2014SH groups is found at the active\nsite of the enzyme ( Figure 17\u20133 ). The substrate initially com-\nbines with this \u2014SH group, forming a thiohemiacetal that is\noxidized to a thiol ester; the hydrogens removed in this oxida-\ntion are transferred to NAD+. The thiol ester then undergoes\nphospho\nrolysis; inorganic phosphate (Pi) is added, forming\n1,3-bisphos\nphoglycerate and the free \u2014SH group.\nIn the next reaction, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase ,\nphosphate is transferred from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate onto\nADP , forming ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) and\n3-phosphoglycerate. Since two molecules of triose phosphate\nare formed per molecule of glucose metabolized, 2\u00d7 ATP are\nformed in this reaction per molecule of glucose undergoing\nglycolysis. The toxicity of arsenic is the result of competition\nof arsenate with inorganic phosphate (Pi) forming 1-arseno-\n3-phosphogly\ncerate, which undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis\nto 3-phosphoglycerate without forming ATP . 3-Phosphoglycerate\nis isomerized to 2-phosphoglycerate by phosphoglycerate mutase .\nIt is likely that 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (diphosphoglycerate,\nDPG) is an intermediate in this reaction.\nCH2\nNAD+NAD+\nNAD+Bound\ncoenzymeP\nNADH +H+NADH +H+\nNAD+H C O\nH\nC OH\nO\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\nC HP O\nC O\nOH\n1,3-BisphosphoglycerateCH2 P O\nC HEnz S\nC\nO\nOH\nCH2 P O OC HEnzSubstrate\noxidation\nby bound\nNAD+\nS\nC\nO\nOH\nCH2 PC HEnz S\nC\nOHH OH\nO\nEnzyme\n\u2013substrate complexCH2 P\nPEnz HS\ni\nFIGURE 17\u20133 Mechanism of oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

Enolase is inhibited by\nfluoride . When blood samples are taken for measurement of\nglucose, the sample is placed into tubes containing fluoride to\ninhibit glycolysis and prevent the breakdown of the glucose\nuntil the sample is analyzed. Enolase is also dependent on the\npresence of either Mg2+or Mn2+ions.\nThe \nphosphate of phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to\nADP in another substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by\npyruvate kinase to form 2\u00d7 ATP per molecule of glucose oxi-\ndized. The reaction of pyruvate kinase is essentially irrevers-\nible under physiologic conditions, partly because of the large\nfree-energy change involved and partly because the immediate\nproduct of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is enolpyruvate,\nwhich undergoes spontaneous isomerization to pyruvate, so\nthat the product of the reaction is not available to undergo the\nreverse reaction.\nThe availability of oxygen determines which of the two path-\nways pyruvate follows. Under anaerobic conditions , the NADH\ncannot be reoxidized through the respiratory chain, and pyru-\nvate is reduced to lactate catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase .\nThis permits the oxidization of NADH to form NAD permit-\nting another molecule of glucose to undergo glycolysis. Under\naerobic conditions , pyruvate is transported into the mitochon-\ndria and undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA\nthen oxidation to CO2in th e citric acid cycle (see Chapter 16).\nThe reducing equivalents from the NADH formed in glycoly-\nsis are taken up into mitochondria for oxidation via either\nthe malate-aspartate shuttle or the glycerophosphate shuttle\n(see Chapter 13).\nTISSUES THAT FUNCTION\nUNDER \nHYPOXIC CONDITIONS\nOR HAVE INTRISICALLY HIGH\nRATES OF GLUCOSE OXIDATION\nPRODUCE LACTATE\nIn organs where glucose is the major substrate for oxidation,\na \nvariable fraction of the glucose uptake can be diverted to\nlactate depending on the metabolic state of the tissue. In tis-\nsues or metabolic states where pyruvate oxidation is absent or\nimpaired, pyruvate is diverted to lactate and released so as to\nrecycle the NAD to support glycolysis and the generation of\nATP to support cellular metabolic work. In erythrocytes pyru-\nvate always terminates in lactate. They lack mitochondria and\nthus cannot oxidize pyruvate. This is true of some skeletal mus-\ncle, particularly the white fibers. During states of high-work\noutput they mobilize muscle glycogen stores. Because they\nlack glucose-6-phosphatase the glucose-6-phosphate mobi-\nlized from glycogen traverses down the glycolytic pathway\nand combined with the relatively low rates of pyruvate oxi-\ndation due to lower mitochondrial oxidative capacity, lactate\nis released. The need for ATP formation may exceed the rate\nat which oxygen is delivered. In those tissues they rely onanaerobic glycolysis to support metabolism (eg, tumors, retina\nand renal medulla, skin). Lactate production is also increased\nin septic shock secondary to both impaired oxygen delivery\nand shifts on metabolic capacity due to cellular injury. Other\ntissues like the brain that normally derive much of their\nenergy from glucose oxidation produce some lactate (3-5% of\ntotal glycolytic flux) because of the high glycolytic rates. The\nliver, kidneys, oxidative skeletal muscle, and heart have very\nhigh oxidative capacity to oxidize multiple fuels. They nor-\nmally take up lactate and oxidize it, but can produce it under\nhypoxic conditions. When lactate production is high, as in\nvigorous exercise, septic shock, and cancer cachexia, lactate is\nused in the liver for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 19), leading\nto an increase in metabolic rate to provide the ATP and GTP\nneeded. This increase may contribute to the increase in meta-\nbolic rate after cessation of vigorous exercise.\nUnder some states lactate can be directly transported into\nthe mitochondria to generate pyruvate and NADH. This allows\nfor the transfer of reducing equivalents (eg, NADH) from the\ncytosol into the mitochondrion for the electron transport\nchain in addition to the glycerophosphate (see Figure 13\u201312)\nand malate-aspartate (see Figure 13\u201313) shuttles.\nGLYCOLYSIS IS REGULATED\nA\nT THREE NONEQUILIBRIUM\nREACTIONS\nAlthough most of the reactions of glycolysis are freely reversible,\nthr\nee are markedly exergonic and are considered to be physi-\nologically irreversible. These reactions, catalyzed by hexokinase\n(and glucokinase), phosphofructokinase , and pyruvate kinase ,\nare the major sites of regulation of glycolysis. Phosphofructo-\nkinase is significantly inhibited at normal intracellular con-\ncentrations of ATP; as discussed in Chapter 19, this inhibition\ncan be rapidly relieved by 5 \u2032AMP that is formed as ADP begins\nto accumulate. It is due to a failure to rapidly convert ADP\nto ATP , signaling the need for an increased rate of glycolysis.\nCells that are capable of gluconeogenesis (reversing the\nglycolytic pathway; see Chapter 19) have different enzymes\nthat catalyze reactions to reverse these irreversible steps:\nglucose-6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and, to\nreverse the reaction of pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxyl-\nase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The reciprocal\nregulation of phosphofructokinase in glycolysis and fruc-\ntose 1,6-bisphosphatase in gluconeogenesis is discussed in\nChapter 19.\nFructose enters glycolysis by phosphorylation to fructose-1-\nphosphate, and bypasses the main regulatory steps, resulting in\nformation of more pyruvate and acetyl-CoA than is required\nfor ATP formation. In addition, increases in fructose-1-P in\nthe liver activate glucokinase (compete for binding of gluco-\nkinase with the glucokinase regulatory protein), amplifying\nhepatic glucose uptake and increasing hepatic lipogenesis and\npredisposing to hepatic steatosis."

It then undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to\nacetyl-CoA, catalyzed by a multienzyme complex that is associatedwith the inner mitochondrial membrane. This pyruvate dehy-\ndrogenase complex is analogous to the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydro-\ngenase complex of the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 16). Pyruvate\nis decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase component\nof the enzyme complex to a hydroxyethyl derivative of the thia-\nzole ring of enzyme-bound thiamin diphosphate , which in\nturn reacts with oxidized lipoamide, the prosthetic group of\ndihydrolipoyl transacetylase , to form acetyl lipoamide\n(Figure 17\u20135 ). In thiamin (vitamin B1; see Chapter 44) defi-\nciency\n, pyruvate oxidation is impaired, and there is significant\n(and potentially life-threatening) lactic and pyruvic acidosis.\nAcetyl lipoamide reacts with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA\nand reduced lipoamide. The reaction is completed when the\nreduced lipoamide is reoxidized by a flavoprotein, dihydroli-\npoyl dehydrogenase , containing flavin adenine dinucleotide\n(FAD). Finally, the reduced flavoprotein is oxidized by NAD+,\nwhich \nin turn transfers reducing equivalents to the respiratory\nchain. The overall reaction is:\nPyruvate + NAD++ CoA \u2192Acetyl-CoA + NADH + H++ CO2\nThe pyruvate dehydrogenase complex consists of a num-\nber \nof polypeptide chains of each of the three component\nenzymes and the intermediates do not dissociate, but are\nchanneled from one enzyme site to the next.

It is also regulated by phosphory-\nlation (catalyzed by a kinase) of three serine residues on the\npyruvate dehydrogenase component of the multienzyme com-\nplex, resulting in decreased activity and by dephosphorylation\n(catalyzed by a phosphatase) that causes an increase in activity.\nThe kinase is activated by increases in the [ATP]/[ADP],\n[acetyl-CoA]/[CoA], and [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios. Thus, pyru-\nva\nte dehydrogenase, and therefore glycolysis, is inhibited both\nwhen there is adequate ATP (and reduced coenzymes for\nATP formation) available, and also when fatty acids are being\noxidized. In fasting, when nonesterified fatty acid concentra-\ntions increase, there is a decrease in the proportion of the\nenzyme in the active form, decreasing pyruvate oxidation.

It occurs mainly in liver an\ue036\nmuscle, with mo\ue036est amounts in the brain. The concentration\n(mg glycogen/g liver) of glycogen in the liver is greater than\nthat of muscle. The total muscle mass of the bo\ue036y is consi\ue036er-\nably greater than that of the liver. Thus, about three-quarters\nof total bo\ue036y glycogen is in muscle ( Table 18\u20131 ).\nGlycogen in liver an\ue036 muscle has \ue036iffering roles in glucose\nhomeostasis. Liver glycogen functions as a reserve to main-\ntain the blood glucose concentration in the fasting state. As\na remin\ue036er (see Chapter 14) the liver makes about 9 grams of\nglucose per hour after an overnight fast of which 6 g/hr is use\ue036\nby glucose requiring tissues (brain an\ue036 re\ue036 bloo\ue036 cells). The\ntotal glycogen mass in the liver is ~90 g ( Table 18\u20131 ). Thus, if\nliver glycogen was the only source of glucose we woul\ue036 have\nonly about 10 hours supply. Of course we have gluconeogen-\nesis (see Chapter 19) as another glucose source in the liver, so\nglycogen stores \ue036o not \ue036eplete as rapi\ue036ly. When we wake up\nin the morning (assuming we \ue036i\ue036 not have a late night snack!)\nwe will have faste\ue036 for ~6 to 8 hours. Our liver glycogen stores\nwill be about 20 g. This amount will \ue036epen\ue036 on when we ate\nour last meal, the rate of intestinal absorption of the carbo-\nhy\ue036rate, an\ue036 composition content of our last meal. If we skip\nbreakfast an\ue036 lunch, by \ue036inner time (>18 h of fasting) liver\nglycogen is almost totally \ue036eplete\ue036. Muscle glycogen pro-\nvi\ue036es a rea\ue036ily available source of glucose-1-phosphate for\nglycolysis within the muscle itself. Muscle glycogen break\ue036own\ue036oes not \ue036irectly yiel\ue036 free glucose because muscle lacks\nglucose-6-phosphatase. During muscle glycogenolysis, pyruvate\nforme\ue036 by glycolysis in muscle can un\ue036ergo transamination to\nalanine or re\ue036uce\ue036 to lactate. They can be exporte\ue036 from mus-\ncle an\ue036 use\ue036 for gluconeogenesis in the liver (see Figure 19\u20134).\nAfter a meal, the replenishment of liver glycogen stores is not\nsolely \ue036ue to the liver \ue036irectly taking up glucose an\ue036 convert-\ning it to glycogen. About 50% of the glycogen accretion is from\n\ue036iversion of gluconeogenic carbon (lactate, glucogenic amino\naci\ue036s) into glycogen (calle\ue036 in\ue036irect glycogen synthesis; see\nChapter 19).\nGlycogen storage diseases are a rare (<1:20,000) group of\ninherite\ue036 \ue036isor\ue036ers characterize\ue036 by \ue036eficient mobilization of\nglycogen or \ue036eposition of abnormal forms of glycogen, lea\ue036-\ning to liver \ue036amage an\ue036 muscle weakness; some result in early\n\ue036eath.

In both tissues, the enzyme is activate\ue036 by\nphosphorylation catalyze\ue036 by phosphorylase kinase (to yiel\ue036\nphosphorylase a) an\ue036 inactivate\ue036 by \ue036ephosphorylation cata-\nlyze\ue036 by phosphoprotein phosphatase (to yiel\ue036 phosphorylase\nb), in response to hormonal an\ue036 other signals.\nThere is instantaneous overri\ue036ing of this hormonal con-\ntrol. Active phosphorylase a in both tissues is allosterically\ninhibite\ue036 by ATP an\ue036 glucose-6-phosphate; in liver, but not\nmuscle, free glucose is also an inhibitor. Muscle phosphorylase\n\ue036iffers from the liver isoenzyme in having a bin\ue036ing site for 5 \u2032\nAMP (see Figure 18\u20135), which acts as an allosteric activator\nof the (inactive) \ue036ephosphorylate\ue036 b-form of the enzyme. 5 \u2032\nAMP acts as a potent signal of the energy state of the mus-\ncle cell; it is forme\ue036 as the concentration of ADP begins to\nincrease (in\ue036icating the nee\ue036 for increase\ue036 substrate metabo-\nlism to permit ATP formation), as a result of the reaction of\na\ue036enylate kinase: 2 \u00d7ADP \u2194ATP +5\u2032AMP . The \ue036iffering\nregulation of muscle an\ue036 liver glycogen phosphorylase likely\nreflects the \ue036iffering roles of glycogen in liver an\ue036 muscle.Liver glycogen is release\ue036 to control plasma glucose. It has to\nbe fast as glucose \ue036eman\ue036s can change rapi\ue036ly. For example in\nexercise liver glucose pro\ue036uction increases twofol\ue036 within a\nfew minutes of exercise. Glucose levels woul\ue036 fall if there was a\n\ue036elay. If exogenous glucose is given the liver must rapi\ue036ly stop\nmaking glucose an\ue036 become a glucose consumer to prevent\nhyperglycemia an\ue036 maximize glycogen repletion.

Muscle phosphorylase kinase,\nwhich activates glycogen phosphorylase, is a tetramer of four\n\ue036ifferent subunits, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, an\ue036 \u03b4. The \u03b1 an\ue036 \u03b2 subunits contain\nserine resi\ue036ues that are phosphorylate\ue036 by cAMP-\ue036epen\ue036ent\nprotein kinase. The \u03b4 subunit is i\ue036entical to the Ca2+-bin\ue036ing\npro\ntein calmodulin (see Chapter 42) an\ue036 bin\ue036s four Ca2+.\nThe b\nin\ue036ing of Ca2+activates the catalytic site of the \u03b3 subunit\neven while the enzyme is in the \ue036ephosphorylate\ue036 b state; the\nphosphorylate\ue036 a form is only fully activate\ue036 in the presence\nof high concentrations of Ca2+.\nGlycogenolysis in Liver Can Be\ncAMP-Independent\nIn the liver, there is cAMP-in\ue036epen\ue036ent activation of glyco-\ngenolysis \nin response to stimulation of \u03b11adrenergic recep-\ntors \nby norepinephrine (in humans the number of \u03b11recepto rs\nis low). This involves mobilization of Ca2+into the cytosol,\nfollowe\ue036 by the stimulation of a Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive\npho\nsphorylase kinase . cAMP-in\ue036epen\ue036ent glycogenolysis is\nalso activate\ue036 by vasopressin, oxytocin, an\ue036 angiotensin II acting\neither through calcium or the phosphati\ue036ylinositol bisphosphate\npathway (see Figure 42\u201310).\nProtein Phosphatase-1 Inactivates\nGlycogen \nPhosphorylase\nBoth phosphorylase a an\ue036 phosphorylase kinase a are \ue036ephos-\nphorylate\ue036 \nan\ue036 inactivate\ue036 by protein phosphatase-1 . Pro-\ntein phosphatase-1 is inhibite\ue036 by a protein, inhibitor-1 ,\nwhich is active only after it has been phosphorylate\ue036 by\ncAMP-\ue036epen\ue036ent protein kinase. Thus, cAMP controls\nboth the activation an\ue036 inactivation of phosphorylase (see\nFigure 18\u20136). Insulin reinforces this effect by inhibiting\nthe activation of phosphorylase b. It \ue036oes this in\ue036irectly by\nincreasing uptake of glucose, lea\ue036ing to increase\ue036 formation\nof glucose-6-phosphate, which is an inhibitor of phosphory-\nlase kinase.The Activities of Glycogen Synthase\n& \nPhosphorylase Are Reciprocally\nRegulated\nThere are \ue036ifferent isoenzymes of glycogen synthase in liver,\nm\nuscle, an\ue036 brain. Like phosphorylase, glycogen synthase exists\nin both phosphorylate\ue036 an\ue036 nonphosphorylate\ue036 states, an\ue036 the\neffect of phosphorylation is the reverse of that seen in phos-\nphorylase ( Figure 18\u20137 ). Active glycogen synthase a is \ue036ephos-\nphorylate\ue036 an\ue036 inactive glycogen synthase b is phosphorylate\ue036.\nSix \ue036ifferent protein kinases act on glycogen synthase, an\ue036\nthere are at least nine \ue036ifferent serine resi\ue036ues in the enzyme\nthat can be phosphorylate\ue036. Two of the protein kinases are Ca2+/\ncalmo\ue036ulin \ue036epen\ue036en\nt (one of these is phosphorylase kinase).\nAnother kinase is cAMP-\ue036epen\ue036ent protein kinase, which\nallows cAMP-me\ue036iate\ue036 hormone action to inhibit glycogen\nsynthesis synchronously with the activation of glycogenolysis.\nInsulin also promotes glycogenesis in muscle at the same time\nas inhibiting glycogenolysis by raising glucose-6-phosphate\nconcentrations, which stimulates the \ue036ephosphorylation an\ue036\nactivation of glycogen synthase. Dephosphorylation of glyco-\ngen synthase b is carrie\ue036 out by protein phosphatase-1, which\nis un\ue036er the control of cAMP-\ue036epen\ue036ent protein kinase.\nGLYCOGEN METABOLISM IS\nREGULA\nTED BY A BALANCE IN\nACTIVITIES BETWEEN GLYCOGEN\nSYNTHASE & PHOSPHORYLASE\nAt the same time, as phosphorylase is activate\ue036 by a rise in\ncon\ncentration of cAMP (via phosphorylase kinase), glycogen\nsynthase is converte\ue036 to the inactive form; both effects are\nme\ue036iate\ue036 via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Figure 18\u20138 ).\nThus, inhibition of glycogenolysis enhances net glycogenesis,\nan\ue036 inhibition of glycogenesis enhances net glycogenolysis.\nAlso, the \ue036ephosphorylation of phosphorylase a, phosphory-\nlase kinase, an\ue036 glycogen synthase b is catalyze\ue036 by a single\nenzyme with broa\ue036 specificity\u2014 protein phosphatase-1 . In\nturn, protein phosphatase-1 is inhibite\ue036 by cAMP-\ue036epen\ue036ent\nprotein kinase via inhibitor-1. Insulin ability to inhibit glyco-\ngenolysis is via its ability to increase protein phosphatase-1\nan\ue036 lower cAMP . Thus, glycogenolysis can be terminate\ue036 an\ue036\nglycogenesis can be stimulate\ue036, or vice versa, synchronously,\nbecause both processes are \ue036epen\ue036ent on the activity of cAMP-\n\ue036epen\ue036ent protein kinase an\ue036 the availability of cAMP . Both\nphosphorylase kinase an\ue036 glycogen synthase may be revers-\nibly phosphorylate\ue036 at more than one site by separate kinases\nan\ue036 phosphatases. These secon\ue036ary phosphorylations mo\ue036ify\nthe sensitivity of the primary sites to phosphorylation an\ue036\n\ue036ephosphorylation (multisite phosphorylation) . They allow\nincreases in glucose an\ue036 insulin by way of increase\ue036 glucose-\n6-phosphate (secon\ue036arily to an increase in plasma glucose that\nactivates glucokinase by translocating it from the nucleus to the\nglycogen granule in the liver), to have effects that act to amplify\nthe effects of insulin to attenuate glycogen mobilization or aug-\nment glycogen synthesis (see Figures 18\u20136 an\ue036 18\u20137)."

The major substrates are the\ng\ue03ducogenic amino aci\ue035s (see Chapter 29), \ue03dactate, g\ue03dycero\ue03d, an\ue035\npropionate. Liver an\ue035 ki\ue035ney are the major g\ue03duconeogenic tissues.\nThe \ue03diver is the primary g\ue03duconeogenic organ. Whi\ue03de the rena\ue03d\ncortex of the ki\ue035ney may contribute about 10% of who\ue03de bo\ue035y\ng\ue03duconeogenesis after a short-term fast (18-24 h), the ki\ue035ney is\nnot a net source of g\ue03ducose. This is because the rena\ue03d me\ue035u\ue03d\ue03da is\na consumer of g\ue03ducose. It is on\ue03dy with \ue03dong-term fasting ( ~7 \ue035ays)\nthat the ki\ue035ney can supp\ue03dy net g\ue03ducose carbon to contribute\nto g\ue03ducose homeostasis. The key g\ue03duconeogenic enzymes are\nexpresse\ue035 in the sma\ue03d\ue03d intestine. Propionate arising from intes-\ntina\ue03d bacteria\ue03d fermentation of carbohy\ue035rates is a substrate for\ng\ue03duconeogenesis in enterocytes. The intestine is not a net con-\nsumer of \ue03dactate an\ue035 a\ue03danine or g\ue03dycero\ue03d, the major substrates\nfor g\ue03duconeogenesis. It is a consumer of g\ue03ducose in the fasting\nstate. Thus, any g\ue03ducose synthesis that occurs \ue03doca\ue03d\ue03dy is \ue03dike\ue03dy\nmetabo\ue03dize\ue035 \ue03doca\ue03d\ue03dy.\nThe rate of hepatic g\ue03duconeogenesis is \ue035etermine\ue035 by\nfour factors: (1) the avai\ue03dabi\ue03dity of g\ue03duconeogenic substrates,\n(2) the capacity of the \ue03diver to take up g\ue03duconeogenic sub-\nstrates, (3) the quantity an\ue035 activity of the g\ue03duconeogenic\nenzymes, an\ue035 (4) the oxi\ue035ative capacity of the \ue03diver to not on\ue03dy\nsupp\ue03dy the energy to support the energy requiring process of\ng\ue03duconeogenesis but metabo\ue03dize the nitrogen from the g\ue03duco-\ngenic amino aci\ue035s (Ureagenesis; see Chapter 28).\nThroughout the 24-hour fee\ue035ing fasting cyc\ue03de g\ue03duconeo-\ngenic precursors are avai\ue03dab\ue03de. In the fasting state a\ue035iposetissue \ue03dipo\ue03dysis re\ue03deases g\ue03dycero\ue03d. Ske\ue03deta\ue03d musc\ue03de re\ue03deases \ue03dac-\ntate an\ue035 g\ue03duconeogenic amino aci\ue035s. As the fast is exten\ue035e\ue035\ng\ue03dycero\ue03d an\ue035 amino aci\ue035s provi\ue035e an increasing ro\ue03de in sup-\np\ue03dying carbon for g\ue03duconeogenesis. One might think that as a\nfast progresses g\ue03duconeogenesis increases even more. In fact,\nit \ue035oes not. This is because the g\ue03ducose \ue035eman\ue035s of periphera\ue03d\ntissues \ue035ecrease inc\ue03du\ue035ing the brain. This preserves the vita\ue03d\nprotein stores. In the fe\ue035 state g\ue03duconeogenic supp\ue03dy \ue035oes not\n\ue035ecrease, in fact it is e\ue03devate\ue035. The mix of carbon sources is\n\ue035ifferent. G\ue03dycero\ue03d supp\ue03dy \ue035ecreases because of a \ue035ecrease in\n\ue03dipo\ue03dysis. Lactate supp\ue03dy \ue035oes not \ue035ecrease primari\ue03dy because\nof the high rates of g\ue03dyco\ue03dysis in ske\ue03deta\ue03d musc\ue03de. Amino aci\ue035\nsupp\ue03dy increases as amino aci\ue035s \ue035erive\ue035 from \ue035ietary protein\nare \ue035irect\ue03dy \ue035e\ue03divere\ue035 into the porta\ue03d vein. During exercise \ue03dactate\nsupp\ue03dy from working musc\ue03de he\ue03dps support the increase\ue035 g\ue03du-\nconeogenic \ue035eman\ue035 of exercise.\nThe transport an\ue035 uptake of amino aci\ue035s, g\ue03dycero\ue03d, an\ue035\n\ue03dactate are regu\ue03date\ue035 \ue035ifferent\ue03dy. The \ue03diver is extreme\ue03dy effi-\ncient at taking up g\ue03dycero\ue03d. Greater than 60% of g\ue03dycero\ue03d\n\ue035e\ue03divere\ue035 to the \ue03diver is remove\ue035 on first pass. This frac-\ntion remains constant in response to increase or \ue035ecrease\nin insu\ue03din, g\ue03ducagon, an\ue035 epinephrine which are impor-\ntant regu\ue03dators of g\ue03duconeogenesis. In contrast amino aci\ue035\nremova\ue03d is very sensitive to g\ue03ducagon an\ue035 to a \ue03desser extent\ninsu\ue03din. G\ue03ducagon is a potent stimu\ue03dator of the transport\nof g\ue03ducogenic amino aci\ue035s by the \ue03diver. About 20% of these\namino aci\ue035s are remove\ue035 on first pass; first pass extraction\ncan increase to more than 60% in the presence of an increase\nin g\ue03ducagon. Insu\ue03din can stimu\ue03date amino aci\ue035 transport but\nthe response is much sma\ue03d\ue03der than that of g\ue03ducagon. Lactate\nuptake by the \ue03diver is comp\ue03dex because the \ue03diver can pro\ue035uce\n\ue03dactate \ue035uring high rates of g\ue03dycogen break\ue035own.

Mitochon\ue035ria\ue03d pyru-\nvate carboxylase cata\ue03dyzes the carboxy\ue03dation of pyruvate to\noxa\ue03doacetate, an ATP-requiring reaction in which the vitamin\nbiotin is the coenzyme. Biotin bin\ue035s CO2from b icarbonate as\ncarboxybiotin prior to the a\ue035\ue035ition of the CO2to pyruvate (see\nFigure 44\u201314).

            "Text": "206 SECTION V Metabolism of Lipids\nBIOMEDICAL IMPORTANCE\nThe lipids are a heterogeneous group of compounds, including\nfa\nts, oils, steroids, waxes, and related compounds. They have the\ncommon property of being (1) relatively insoluble in water and\n(2)soluble in nonpolar solvents such as ether and chloroform.\nThey are important dietary constituents, not only because of\nthe high energy value of fats (see Chapter 22), but also because\nessential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipophilic\nmicronutrients are contained in the fat of natural foods. Dietary\nsupplementation with long-chain \u03c93 fatty acids is believed to\nhave beneficial effects in a number of chronic diseases, includ-\ning cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and dementia.\nFat is stored in adipose tissue , where it also serves as a ther-\nmal insulator in the subcutaneous tissues and around certain\norgans. Nonpolar lipids act as electrical insulators , allowing\nrapid propagation of depolarization waves along myelinated\nnerves . Lipids are transported in the blood combined with pro-\nteins in lipoprotein particles (see Chapters 25 and 26). Lipids\nhave essential roles in nutrition and health, and knowledge of\nlipid biochemistry is necessary for the understanding of many\nimportant biomedical conditions, including obesity, diabetes\nmellitus ,and atherosclerosis .\nLIPIDS MAY BE SIMPLE, COMPLEX,\nOR \nDERIVED\n1. Simple lipids include fa ts, oils, and waxes which are esters\nof fatty acids with various alcohols:\na. Fats: Esters of fatty acids with glycerol\nb. Oils: Fats in the liquid state at room temperature\nc. Waxes: Esters of fatty acids with higher molecular weight\nmonohydric alcohols\n2. Complex lipids are esters of fatty acids, which always con-\ntain an alcohol and one or more fatty acids, but which also\nhave other groups. They can be divided into three types:\na. Phospholipids: Contain a phosphoric acid residue.\nThey frequently have nitrogen-containing bases (eg,\ncholine) and other substituents. In many phospholipids\nthe alcohol is glycerol ( glycerophospholipids ), but in\nsphingophospholipids it is sphingosine, which contains\nan amino group.\nb. Glycolipids (glycosphingolipids): Contain a fatty acid,\nsphingosine, and carbohydrate.\nc. Other complex lipids: These include lipids such as\nsulfolipids and amino lipids. Lipoproteins may also be\nplaced in this category.\n3. Derived lipids are formed from the hydrolysis of both sim-\nple and complex lipids. They include fatty acids , glycerol,\nsteroids/sterols (including cholesterol), other alcohols, fatty\naldehydes, ketone bodies (see Chapter 22), hydrocarbons,\nlipid-soluble vitamins and micronutrients, and hormones.\nSome of these (eg, free fatty acids, glycerol) also act as pre-\ncursor lipids in the formation of simple and complex lipids.Because they are uncharged, acylglycerols (glycerides), choles-\nterol, and cholesteryl esters are termed neutral lipids .\nFATTY ACIDS ARE ALIPHATIC\nCARBO\nXYLIC ACIDS\nFatty acids occur in the body mainly as esters in natural fats\nand oi\nls, but are found in the unesterified form as free fatty\nacids , a transport form in the plasma. Fatty acids that occur\nin natural fats usually contain an even number of carbon\natoms. The chain may be saturated (containing no double\nbonds) or unsaturated (containing one or more double\nbonds) ( Figure 21\u20131 ).\nFatty Acids Are Named After\nCorresponding \nHydrocarbons\nThe most frequently used systematic nomenclature names\nthe \nfatty acid after the hydrocarbon with the same number\nand arrangement of carbon atoms, with -oic being substi-\ntuted for the final -e(Genevan system). Saturated acids end\nin-anoic , for example, octanoic acid (C8) (from the hydrocar-\nbon octane), and unsaturated acids with double bonds end in\n-enoic , for example, octadecenoic acid (oleic acid, C18) (from\nthe hydrocarbon octadecane).\nCarbon atoms are numbered from the carboxyl carbon\n(carbon no. 1). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carboxyl car-\nbon (nos. 2, 3, and 4) are also known as the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 carbons,\nrespectively, and the terminal methyl carbon is known as the\n\u03c9- or n-carbon.\nVarious conventions are used for indicating the number\nand position of the double bonds ( Figure 21\u20132 ); for example,\n\u03949indicates a double bond on the ninth carbon countingCOOH\nCOOHA\n saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid, C16)\nA monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid, C18:1)\nCOOH\nA polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid, C18:2)\nFIGURE 21\u20131 Fatty acids. Examples of a saturated (palmitic\nacid), monounsaturated (oleic acid), and a polyunsaturated (linoleic\nacid) fatty acid are shown.\nFIGURE 21\u20132 Nomenclature for number and position of\ndouble \nbonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Illustrated using oleic\nacid as an example. In this example, C1 is the \u03941carbon  and C18 is\nthe \u03c9 or n-1 carbon. Thus oleic acid may be termed 18:1 \u03c99 (or n-9)\nor 18:1 \u03949."

Eicosanoids: These compounds, derived from eicosa\n(20-carbon) polyenoic fatty acids (see Chapter 23), com-\nprise the prostanoids ,leukotrienes (LTs) , and lipoxins\n(LXs) . Prostanoids include prostaglandins (PGs) ,prosta-\ncyclins (PGIs) , and thromboxanes (TXs) .\nProstaglandins exist in virtually every mammalian tis-\nsue, acting as local hormones; they have important physiologic\nand pharmacologic activities. They are synthesized in vivo\nby cyclization of the center of the carbon chain of 20-carbon\n(eicosanoic) polyunsaturated fatty acids (eg, arachidonic acid)\nto form a cyclopentane ring ( Figure 21\u20133 ). A related series of\ncompounds, the thromboxanes , have the cyclopentane ring\ninterrupted with an oxygen atom (oxane ring) ( Figure 21\u20134 ).\nThree different eicosanoic fatty acids give rise to three groups of\neicosanoids characterized by the number of double bonds in the\nside chains (see Figure 23\u201312), for example, PG1, PG2, and PG3\n(PG,\n prostaglandin). Different substituent groups attached to\nthe rings give rise to series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes\n(TX) labeled A, B, etc (see Figure 23\u201312)\u2014for example, the \u201cE\u201d\ntype of prostaglandin (as in PGE2) has a keto group in posi-\ntion \n9, whereas the \u201cF\u201d type has a hydroxyl group in this position.\nTheleukotrienes andlipoxins (Figure 21\u20135 ) are a third group\nof eicosanoid derivatives formed via the lipoxygenase pathway\n(see Figure 23\u201313). They are characterized by the presence of\nthree or four conjugated double bonds, respectively. Leukotrienes\ncause bronchoconstriction as well as being potent proinflam-\nmatory agents, and play a part in asthma .\nMost Naturally Occurring Unsaturated\nF\natty Acids Have cisDouble Bonds\nThe carbon chains of saturated fatty acids form a zigzag pat-\ntern \nwhen extended at low temperatures (see Figure 21\u20131). At\nhigher temperatures, some bonds rotate, causing chain short-\nening, which explains why biomembranes become thinner\nwith increases in temperature. Since carbon\u2013carbon double\nbonds do not allow rotation, a type of geometric isomerism\noccurs in unsaturated fatty acids, termed cis\u2013trans isomerism ,\nwhich depends on the orientation of atoms or groups around\nthe axes of their double bonds. If the acyl chains are on thesame side of the bond, it is cis-, as in oleic acid; if on oppo-\nsite sides, it is trans -, as in elaidic acid, the trans isomer of\noleic acid ( Figure 21\u20136 ). Double bonds in naturally occur-\nring unsaturated long-chain fatty acids are nearly all in the\ncisconfiguration, the molecules being \u201cbent\u201d 120\u00b0 at the\ndouble bond. Thus, oleic acid has a V shape, whereas elaidic\nacid remains \u201cstraight. \u201d Increase in the number of cisdouble\nbonds in a fatty acid leads to a variety of possible spatial con-\nfigurations of the molecule\u2014for example, arachidonic acid, with\nfour cisdouble bonds, is bent into a U shape ( Figure 21\u20137 ).\nThis has profound significance for molecular packing in cell\nmembranes (see Chapter 40) and on the positions occupied\nby fatty acids in complex lipids such as phospholipids. Trans\ndouble bonds alter these spatial relationships. Although\ndouble bonds in naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids\nare almost always in the cisconfiguration, trans -fatty acids\nare present in foods such as those derived from ruminant fat\n(caused by the action of microorganisms in the rumen) and\nthose containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (industrial\ntrans fats), which are a by-product of the saturation of fatty\nO\nO\nOHCOO\u2013\nFIGURE 21\u20134 Thromboxane A2(T XA2).COOH\nCOOHL\nTA4\nLXA4O\nOH\nOHOH\nFIGURE 21\u20135 Leukotriene and lipoxin structure.

Dietary trans -fatty acids, how-\never, are now known to be detrimental to health, being associ-\nated with increased risk of diseases including cardiovascular\ndisease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. For this reason the con-\ntent of industrial trans fats in foods is currently limited to a\nlow level by law in many countries. A plan to eliminate these\nindustrially generated fats completely from the world\u2019s food\nsupply was announced by the World Health Organization\nin 2018.\nPhysical and Physiologic Properties\nof \nFatty Acids Reflect Chain Length &\nDegree of Unsaturation\nThe melting points of even-numbered carbon fatty acids\nincrease with chain length \nand decrease according to unsatu-\nration. Thus, a triacylglycerol containing three saturated fatty\nacids of 12 or more carbons is solid at body temperature,\nwhereas if the fatty acid residues are polyunsaturated, it is liq-\nuid to below 0\u00b0C. In practice, natural acylglycerols contain a\nmixture of fatty acids tailored to suit their functional roles. For\nexample, membrane lipids, which must be fluid at all environ-\nmental temperatures, are more unsaturated than storage lip-\nids. Lipids in tissues that are subject to cooling, for example,\nduring hibernation or in the extremities of animals, are also\nmore unsaturated.\n\u03c93 Fatty Acids Are Anti-Inflammatory & Have\nHealth \nBenefits\nLong-chain \u03c93 fatty acids such as \u03b1-linolenic (ALA) (found\nin plant oils), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) (found in fish oil), and\ndocosahexaenoic (DHA) (found in fish and algal oils) (see\nTable 21\u20132) have anti-inflammatory effects, perhaps due to\ntheir promotion of the synthesis of less inflammatory prosta-\nglandins and leukotrienes as compared to \u03c96 fatty acids (see\nFigure 23\u201312). In view of this, their potential use as a therapy\nin severe chronic disease where inflammation is a contribu-\ntory cause is under intensive investigation. Current evidence\nsuggests that diets rich in \u03c93 fatty acids are beneficial, par-\nticularly for cardiovascular disease , but also for other chronic\ndegenerative diseases such as cancer ,rheumatoid arthritis ,\nand Alzheimer disease .TRIACYLGLYCEROLS\n(TRIGL\nYCERIDES)*ARE THE MAIN\nSTORAGE FORMS OF FATTY ACIDS\nThe triacylglycerols ( Fi gure 21\u20138 ) are esters of the trihydric alco-\nhol glycerol and fatty acids. Mono- and diacylglycerols, wherein\none or two fatty acids are esterified with glycerol, are also found\nin the tissues. These are of particular significance in the synthesis\nand hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (see Chapters 24 and 25).\nCarbons 1 & 3 of Glycerol\nAre \nNot Identical\nIt is important to realize that carbons 1 and 3 of glycerol are not\nidentical \nwhen viewed in three dimensions (shown as a projec-\ntion formula in Figure 21\u20138B). To number the carbon atoms of\nglycerol unambiguously, the -sn(stereochemical numbering)\nsystem is used. Enzymes readily distinguish between the sn-1\nandsn-3 positions and are nearly always specific for one or the\nother carbon; for example, glycerol kinase always phosphory-\nlates glycerol on sn-3, not sn-1 to give glycerol-3-phosphate\nand not glycerol-1-phosphate (see Figure 24\u20132).\nPHOSPHOLIPIDS ARE THE\nMAIN \nLIPID CONSTITUENTS OF\nMEMBRANES\nMany phospholipids are derivatives of phosphatidic acid\n(Figure 21\u20139 ), in which a glycerol moiety is esterified to a phos-\nphate group and two long-chain fatty acids (glycerophospho-\nlipids).

They are widely distributed in every tissue\nof the body, particularly in nervous tissue such as brain. They\noccur particularly in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane,\nwhere they contribute to cell surface carbohydrates which\nform the glycocalyx (see Chapter 15).\nThe major glycolipids found in animal tissues are glyco-\nsphingolipids. They contain ceramide and one or more sugars.\nGalactosylceramide (Figure 21\u201314) is a major glycosphingo-\nlipid of brain and other nervous tissue, found in relatively low\namounts elsewhere. It contains a number of characteristic C24\nfatty acids, for example, cerebronic acid.\nGalactosylceramide can be converted to sulfogalacto-\nsylceramide (sulfatide) which has a sulfo group attached to\nthe O in the three position of galactose and is present in high\namounts in myelin .Glucosylceramide resembles galactosyl-\nceramide, but the head group is glucose rather than galactose.\nIt is the predominant simple glycosphingolipid of extraneural\ntissues, also occurring in the brain in small amounts. Ganglio-\nsides are complex glycosphingolipids derived from glucosyl-\nceramide that contain in addition one or more molecules of\nsialic acid .Neuraminic acid (NeuAc; see Chapter 15) is the\nprincipal sialic acid found in human tissues. Gangliosides are\nalso present in nervous tissues in high concentration.

The simplest ganglioside found in tissues is GM3 (see\nFigure 24\u20138), which contains ceramide, one molecule of glu-\ncose, one molecule of galactose, and one molecule of NeuAc.\nIn the shorthand nomenclature used, G represents ganglio-\nside; M is a monosialo-containing species; and 3 is a number\nassigned on the basis of chromatographic migration. GM1\n(Figure 21\u201315 ), a more complex ganglioside derived from\nGM3, is of considerable biologic interest, as it is known to be\nthe receptor in human intestine for cholera toxin .

It is the precur-\nsor of a large number of equally important steroids that include\nthebile acids ,adrenocortical hormones ,sex hormones ,\nvitamin D (see Chapters 26, 41, 44), and cardiac glycosides .\nAll steroids have a similar cyclic nucleus resembling phen-\nanthrene (rings A, B, and C) to which a cyclopentane ring (D)\nis attached. The carbon positions on the steroid nucleus are\nnumbered as shown in Figure 21\u201316 . It is important to real-\nize that in structural formulas of steroids, a simple hexagonal\nring denotes a completely saturated six-carbon ring with all\nvalences satisfied by hydrogen bonds unless shown otherwise;\nthat is, it is not a benzene ring. All double bonds are shown as\nsuch. Methyl groups (shown as single bonds unattached at the\nfarther [methyl] end) occur typically at positions 10 and 13\nand constitute C atoms 19 and 18.

The\nmethyl groups attached to C10 and C13 are invariably in the\n\u03b2 configuration.\nCholesterol Is a Significant Constituent\nof \nMany Tissues\nCholesterol (Figure 21\u201319 ) is widely distributed in all cells\nof the body but particularly in nervous tissue. It is a major\nconstituent of the plasma membrane (see Chapter 40) and of\nplasma lipoproteins (see Chapters 25 and 26). It is often found\nascholesteryl ester , where the hydroxyl group on position 3 is\nesterified with a long-chain fatty acid. It occurs in animals but\nnot in plants or bacteria.Ergosterol Is a Precursor of Vitamin D\nErgosterol occurs in plants and yeast and is important as a\ndietary s\nource of vitamin D (see Chapter 44) (Figure 21\u201320 ).\nWhen irradiated with ultraviolet light in the skin, ring B is\nopened to form vitamin D2in a process similar to the one that\nforms vitamin D3from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin (see\nFigure 44\u20133).\nPolyprenoids Share the Same Parent\nCompound \nas Cholesterol\nPolyprenoids are n ot steroids but are related to them because\nthey are synthesized, like cholesterol (see Figure 26\u20132), from\nfive-carbon isoprene units ( Figure 21\u201321 ). They include ubi-\nquinone (see Chapter 13), which participates in the respi-\nratory chain in mitochondria, and dolichols, long-chain\nalcohols containing 15 to 23 isoprene units in animal cells\n(Figure 21\u201322 ), which take part in glycoprotein synthesis by\ntransferring oligosaccharide residues to asparagine residues of\nthe glycoprotein polypeptide chains as they are formed (see\nChapter 46). Plant-derived polyprenoids include rubber, cam-\nphor, the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, and \u03b2-carotene\n(provitamin A).\nLIPID PEROXIDATION IS A\nSOURCE \nOF FREE RADICALS\nPeroxidation (auto-oxi dation) of lipids exposed to oxygen-\nforming peroxides is responsible not only for deterioration\nof foods (rancidity) , but also for damage to tissues in vivo,\nwhere it may be a cause of cancer, inflammatory diseases,\natherosclerosis, and aging. The deleterious effects are con-\nsidered to be caused by free radicals , molecules that have\nunpaired valence electrons, making them highly reactive.\nFree radicals containing oxygen (eg, ROO\u2022, RO\u2022, OH\u2022) are termed\u201cChair\u201d form \u201cBoat\u201d  form\nFIGURE 21\u201317 Conformations of stereoisomers of the ste-\nroid \nnucleus.\nAA\nB\nH\nA\n BH\nHHHDCHH\nHCD\n35\n1\n1\n0\n59\n8141317\n3ABBH1 0\n5\n310\n1413\n98\nA B\nH1\n1\n0\n5\n3oror\nFIGURE 21\u201318 Generalized steroid nucleus, showing (A) an\nall-trans configurat\nion between adjacent rings and (B) a ciscon-\nfiguration between rings A and B.HOB\nFIGURE 21\u201320 Ergosterol.HO3\n5\n617\nFIGURE 21\u201319 Cholesterol."

These are produced during\nperoxide formation from fatty acids containing methylene-\ninterrupted double bonds, that is, those found in the naturally\noccurring polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Figure 21\u201323 ).Lipid\nperoxidation is a chain reaction in which free radicals\nformed in the initiation stage in turn generate more (prop-\nagation), and thus it has potentially devastating effects. The\nprocesses of initiation and propagation can be depicted as\nfollows:\n1. Initiation: A free radical (X\u2022) reacts with a polyunsaturated\nfatty \nacid forming the first fatty acid radical (R\u20221).\nX\u2022+R1H\u2192R\u20221+XH\n2. \nPropagation: The unstable fatty acid radical R\u20221reacts with\noxygen to produce a peroxyl radical (R1OO\u2022) which then\nattacks \nanother fatty acid to form a new fatty acid radical R\u20222\nand a pero\nxide of R1. R\u20222can then react with fa tty acid R3H\nand \nso on in a chain reaction.

Major dolichols in humans contain 19\nor 20 isoprene units.\nFIGURE 21\u201323 Lipid peroxidation. The reaction may be initiated by an existing free radical (X\u2022), by light, or by metal ions. Malondialde-\nhyde \nis only formed by fatty acids with three or more double bonds and is used as a measure of lipid peroxidation together with ethane from the\nterminal two carbons of \u03c93 fatty acids and pentane from the terminal five carbons of \u03c96 fatty acids.Antioxidants are used to control and reduce lipid per-\noxidation, both by humans in their activities and in nature.\nPropyl gallate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butyl-\nated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are antioxidants used as food\nadditives. Naturally occurring antioxidants include vitamin E\n(tocopherol) (see Chapter 44), which is lipid soluble, and\nurate and vitamin C, which are water soluble. \u03b2-Carotene is\nan antioxidant at low PO2. Antioxidants fall into two classes:\n(1)pr\neventive antioxidants , which reduce the rate of chain ini-\ntiation (stage 1 above) and (2) chain-breaking antioxidants ,\nwhich interfere with chain propagation (stage 2 above). Pre-\nventive antioxidants include catalase and other peroxidases\nsuch as glutathione peroxidase (see Figure 20\u20133) that react\nwith ROOH; selenium, which is an essential component of\nglutathione peroxidase and regulates its activity, and chelators\nof metal ions such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and\ndiethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA). In vivo, the principal\nchain-breaking antioxidants are superoxide dismutase, which\nacts in the aqueous phase to trap superoxide free radicals\n(O2\u2022\u2013), urate, and vitamin E, which acts in the lipid phase to\ntrap ROO\u2022radicals.\nPer\noxidation is also catalyzed in vivo by heme compounds\nand by lipoxygenases (see Figure 23\u201313) found in platelets\nand leukocytes. Other products of auto-oxidation or enzy-\nmic oxidation of physiologic significance include oxysterols\n(formed from cholesterol) and the prostaglandin-like iso-\nprostanes (formed from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated\nfatty acids such as arachidonic acid) which are used as reliable\nmarkers of oxidative stress in humans."

Liposomes\nconsist of spheres of lipid bilayers that enclose part of the\naqueous medium. They may be formed by sonicating an\namphipathic lipid in an aqueous medium.

In most mammals, glucose\nis the primary substrate for lipogenesis, but in ruminants it\nis acetate, the main fuel molecule they obtain from the diet.\nCritical diseases of the pathway have not been reported in\nhumans. However, inhibition of lipogenesis occurs in type 1\n(insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus , and variations in the\nactivity of the process affect the nature and extent of obesity .\nUnsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids of the cell mem-\nbrane are important in maintaining membrane fluidity (see\nChapter 40). A high ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to\nsaturated fatty acids (P:S ratio) in the diet is considered to be\nbeneficial in preventing coronary heart disease. Animal tissues\nhave limited capacity for desaturating fatty acids, and require\ncertain dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from plants.\nThese essential fatty acids are used to form eicosanoic (C20)\nfatty acids, which give rise to the eicosanoids prostagland\nins,thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Prostaglandins\nmediate inflammation ,pain, induce sleep , and also regulate\nblood coagulation and reproduction .Nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibupro-\nfenact by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

Acetyl-\nCoA carboxylase is a multienzyme protein containing biotin\ncarboxylase, and a carboxyl transferase as well as biotin carrier\nprotein (which binds biotin), and a regulatory allosteric site.\nThe reaction takes place in two steps: Step 1 catalyzed by biotin\ncarboxylase results in the carboxylation of biotin and uses\nATP and Step 2 catalyzed by carboxyl transferase results in\nthe transfer of the carboxyl group to acetyl-CoA forming the\nproduct, malonyl-CoA ( Figure 23\u20131 ). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase\nhas a major role in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis\n(see following discussion).\nThe Fatty Acid Synthase Complex Is a\nHomodimer \nof Two Polypeptide Chains\nContaining Six Enzyme Activities\n& the Acyl Carrier Protein\nAfter the formation of malonyl-CoA, fatty acids are formed\nby \nthefatty acid synthase enzyme complex . The individual\nenzymes required for fatty acid synthesis are linked in this\nmultienzyme polypeptide complex that incorporates the acyl\ncarrier protein (ACP) , which has a similar function to that of\nCoA in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway (see Chapter 22). It contains the\nvitamin pantothenic acid in the form of 4 \u2032-phosphopantetheine\n(see Figure 44\u201315). In the primary structure of the protein,the enzyme domains are believed to be linked in the sequence\nas shown in Figure 23\u20132 . X-ray crystallography of the three-\ndimensional structure, however, has shown that the complex\nis a homodimer, with two identical subunits, each containing six\nenzymes and an ACP , arranged in an X shape (see Figure 23\u20132).\nThe use of one multienzyme functional unit has the advan-\ntages of achieving compartmentalization of the process within\nthe cell without the necessity for permeability barriers, and\nsynthesis of all enzymes in the complex is coordinated since it\nis encoded by a single gene.\nInitially, a priming molecule of acetyl-CoA combines with\na cysteine \u2014SH group on the ACP of one monomer of the\nfatty acid synthase complex (Figure 23\u20133 , reaction 1a), while\nmalonyl-CoA combines with the adjacent \u2014SH on the 4 \u2032-\nphosphopantetheine of ACP of the other monomer (reaction 1b).\nThese reactions are catalyzed by malonyl acetyl transacylase ,\nto form acetyl (acyl)-malonyl enzyme . The acetyl group attacks\nthe methylene group of the malonyl residue, catalyzed by\n3-ketoacyl synthase , and liberates CO2, forming 3-ket oacyl\nenzyme (acetoacetyl enzyme) (reaction 2), freeing the cysteine\n\u2014SH group. Decarboxylation allows the reaction to go to com-\npletion, pulling the whole sequence of reactions in the forward\ndirection. The 3-ketoacyl group is reduced (3-ketoacylreductase),\ndehydrated (dehydratase), and reduced again (enoyl reductase)\n(reactions 3-5) to form the corresponding saturated acyl enzyme\n(product of reaction 5). The saturated acyl residue now transfers\nfrom the \u2014SH of the 4 \u2032phosphopantetheine to the free cysteine\n\u2014SH group as it is displaced by a new malonyl-CoA. The sequence\nof reactions is repeated six more times until a saturated\n16-carbon acyl radical (palmitoyl) has been assembled. It is\nliberated from the enzyme complex by the activity of the\nsixth enzyme in the complex, thioesterase (deacylase).

Other sources of NADPH include the reac-\ntion that converts malate to pyruvate catalyzed by the NADP\nmalate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme) (Figure 23\u20134 ) and the\nextramitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction (a sub-\nstantial source in ruminants).\nAcetyl-CoA Is the Principal Building\nBlock \nof Fatty Acids\nAcetyl-CoA is formed from glucose via the oxidation of pyru-\nvate\n in the matrix of the mitochondria (see Chapter 17).\nHowever, as it does not diffuse readily across the mitochondrial\nmembranes, its transport into the cytosol, the principal site\nof fatty acid synthesis, requires a special mechanism involv-\ningcitrate . After condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloac-\netate in the citric acid cycle within mitochondria, the citrate\nproduced can be translocated into the extramitochondrial\ncompartment via the tricarboxylate transporter, where in the\npresence of CoA and ATP , it undergoes cleavage to acetyl-\nCoA and oxaloacetate by ATP-citrate lyase , which increases\nin activity in the well-fed state. The acetyl-CoA is then avail-\nable for malonyl-CoA formation and synthesis of fatty acids\n(see Figures 23\u20131 and 23\u20133), and the oxaloacetate can form\nmalate via NADH-linked malate dehydrogenase, followed by\nthe generation of NADPH and pyruvate via the malic enzyme.\nThe NADPH becomes available in the cytosol for lipogen-\nesis, and the pyruvate can be used to regenerate acetyl-CoA\nafter transport into the mitochondrion (see Figure 23\u20134).\nThis pathway is a means of transferring reducing equivalents\nfrom extramitochondrial NADH to NADP to form NADPH.Ketoacyl\nsynthaseDehydrataseEnoyl\nreductaseKetoacyl\nreductaseACP\nKetoacyl\nreductaseEnoyl\nreductase\nHydratase\nKetoacyl\nsynthase\nMalonyl/acetyl\ntransacylaseMalonyl/acetyl\ntransacylaseEnoyl\nreductaseKetoacyl\nreductase\nACP\nThioesteraseACP\nThioesteraseThioesterase N- -C\nSequence of enzyme domains in primary structure of fatty acid synthase monomer\nFatty acid synthase homodimerMalonyl/acetyl\ntransacylase\nFIGURE 23\u20132 Fatty acid synthase multienzyme complex.

Lipogenesis converts surplus glucose and intermediates such\nas pyruvate, lactate, and acetyl-CoA to fat, assisting the anabolic\nphase of this feeding cycle. The nutritional state of the organism isthe main factor regulating the rate of lipogenesis. Thus, the rate\nis high in the well-fed animal whose diet contains a high pro-\nportion of carbohydrate. It is depressed by restricted caloric\nintake, high-fat diet, or a deficiency of insulin, as in diabetes\nmellitus. These latter conditions are associated with increased\nconcentrations of plasma-free fatty acids, and an inverse rela-\ntionship has been demonstrated between hepatic lipogenesis\nand the concentration of serum-free fatty acids. Lipogenesis\nis increased when sucrose (a disaccharide consisting of glu-\ncose and fructose) is fed instead of glucose because fructose\nbypasses the phosphofructokinase control point in glycolysis\nand floods the lipogenic pathway (see Figure 20\u20135).\nSHORT- & LONG-TERM\nMECHANISMS \nREGULATE\nLIPOGENESIS\nLong-chain fatty acid synthesis is controlled in the short term\nby allosteric a\nnd covalent modification of enzymes and in the\nlong term by changes in gene expression governing rates of\nsynthesis of enzymes.FIGURE 23\u20134 The provision of acetyl-CoA and NADPH for lipogenesis.

Citrate promotes the conversion of the enzyme from\nan inactive dimer (two subunits of the enzyme complex) to\nan active polymeric form, with a molecular mass of several\nmillion. Inactivation is promoted by phosphorylation of the\nenzyme and by long-chain acyl-CoA molecules, an example\nof negative feedback inhibition by a product of a reaction(Figure 23\u20136 ). Thus, if acyl-CoA accumulates because it is not\nesterified quickly enough or because of increased lipolysis or\nan influx of free fatty acids into the tissue, it will automatically\nreduce the rate of synthesis of new fatty acid. Acyl-CoA also\ninhibits the mitochondrial tricarboxylate transporter , thus\npreventing activation of the enzyme by egress of citrate from\nthe mitochondria into the cytosol (see Figure 23\u20136).\nAcetyl-CoA carboxylase is also regulated by hormones\nsuch as glucagon ,epinephrine , and insulin via changes in its\nphosphorylation state (details in Figure 23\u20137 ).\nPyruvate Dehydrogenase Is Also\nRegulated \nby Acyl-CoA\nAcyl-CoA causes an inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase,\nthe \nenzyme which catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA\nfrom pyruvate to link glycolysis with the citric acid cycle (see\nChapters 16 and 17), by inhibiting the ATP-ADP exchange\ntransporter of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This leads\nto increased intramitochondrial (ATP)/(ADP) ratios and\ntherefore to conversion of active to inactive pyruvate dehy-\ndrogenase (see Figure 17\u20136), thus regulating the availability\nof acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. Furthermore, oxidation of acyl-\nCoA due to increased levels of free fatty acids may increase the\nratios of (acetyl-CoA)/(CoA) and (NADH)/(NAD+) in mito-\nchondria, \nwhich also inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase.\nInsulin Also Regulates Lipogenesis by\nOther \nMechanisms\nInsulin stimula tes lipogenesis by several other mechanisms\nas well as by increasing acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity.

Trans fatty acids compete with\nessential fatty acids and may exacerbate essential fatty acid\ndeficiency. Moreover, they are structurally similar to saturated\nfatty acids (see Chapter 21) and have comparable effects in the\npromotion of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (see\nChapter 26).\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory\nDrugs \nInhibit COX\nAspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)\nthat \ninhibits COX-1 and COX-2.

Tri-\nacylglycerols \nare the major lipids in fat deposits and in food,\nand their roles in lipid transport and storage and in various\ndiseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipoproteinemia\nwill be described in subsequent chapters. The amphipathic\nnature of phospholipids and sphingolipids makes them ideally\nsuitable as the main lipid component of cell membranes.\nPhospholipids also take part in the metabolism of many\nother lipids. Some phospholipids have specialized functions;\nfor example, dipalmitoyl lecithin is a major component of lung\nsurfactant , which is lacking in respiratory distress syndrome\nof the newborn. Inositol phospholipids in the cell membrane\nact as precursors of hormone second messengers , and platelet-\nactivating factor (PAF), an alkylphospholipid, functions in\nthe mediation of inflammation. Glycosphingolipids, which\ncontain sphingosine and sugar residues as well as a fatty acid,\nare found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane with\ntheir oligosaccharide chains facing outward. They form part\nof the glycocalyx of the cell surface and are important (1) in\ncell adhesion and cell recognition, (2) as receptors for bacte-\nrial toxins (eg, the toxin that causes cholera), and (3) as ABOblood group substances.

This is followed by free fatty acid uptake into\ntissues (including liver, heart, kidney, muscle, lung, testis,\nand adipose tissue, but not readily by brain), where they are\noxidized to obtain energy or reesterified.

            "Text": "240 SECTION V Metabolism of Lipids\nTRIACYLGLYCEROLS &\nPHOSPHOGL\nYCEROLS ARE\nFORMED BY ACYLATION OF\nTRIOSE PHOSPHATES\nThe major pathways of triacylglycerol and phosphoglycerol\nbi\nosynthesis are outlined in Figure 24\u20131 . Important substances\nsuch as triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyletha-\nnolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin, a constituent\nof mitochondrial membranes, are formed from glycerol-\n3-phosphate . Significant branch points in the pathway occur at\nthephosphatidate anddiacylglycerol steps. Dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate is the precursor for phosphoglycerols containing an\nether link (\u2014C\u2014O\u2014C\u2014), the best known of which are plas-\nmalogens and PAF. Both glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxy-\nacetone phosphate are intermediates in glycolysis, making a very\nimportant connection between carbohydrate and lipid metabo-\nlism (see Chapter 14).\nBoth the glycerol and fatty acid components must be acti-\nvated by ATP before they can be incorporated into acylglycerols.\nGlycerol kinase catalyzes the activation of glycerol to sn-\nglycerol-3-phosphate. If the activity of this enzyme is absent or\nlow, as in muscle or adipose tissue, most of the glycerol-\n3-phosphate is formed from dihydroxyacetone phosphate by\nglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Figure 24\u20132 ).\nPhosphatidate Is the Common\nPrecursor \nin the Biosynthesis\nof Triacylglycerols, Many\nPhosphoglycerols, & Cardiolipin\nBiosynthesis of Triacylglycerols\nAcyl-CoA, formed by the activation of fatty acids by acyl- CoA\nsynthetase (see Chapter 22), combines with glycerol-3-phosphate\nin two successive reactions catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate\nacyltransferase and1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransfer-\nase, resulting in the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate orphosphatidate (see Figure 24\u20132). In the triacylglycerol branch\nof the pathway, phosphatidate is converted by phosphatidate\nphosphohydrolase (also called phosphatidate phosphatase\n[PAP]) to 1,2-diacylglycerol which is then converted to triacyl-\nglycerol by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) .Lipins , a\nfamily of three proteins, have phosphatidate phosphohydrolase\nactivity and they also act as transcription factors which regulate\nthe expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. DGAT\ncatalyzes the only step specific for triacylglycerol synthesis and\nis thought to be rate limiting in most circumstances. In intestinal\nmucosa, monoacylglycerol acyltransferase converts monoacyl-\nglycerol to 1,2-diacylglycerol in the monoacylglycerol pathway .\nMost of the activity of these enzymes resides in the endoplasmic\nreticulum, but some is found in mitochondria. Although phos-\nphatidate phosphohydrolase protein is found mainly in the cyto-\nsol, the active form of the enzyme is membrane bound.\nBiosynthesis of Phospholipids\nThe biosynthesis of phosp hatidylcholine andphosphatidyl-\nethanolamine also involves the conversion of phosphatidate\nto 1,2-diacylglycerol (see Figure 24\u20132). Before the next step,\nhowever, choline or ethanolamine must first be activated by\nphosphorylation by ATP and then linked to CDP . The resulting\nCDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine reacts with 1,2-diacylglycerol\nto form either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine,\nrespectively (see Figure 24\u20132, lower left). In the case of phospha-\ntidylinositol formation, it is phosphatidate that is linked to CDP ,\nforming CDP-diacylglycerol, which is then linked to inositol by\nphosphatidylinositol synthase . The second messenger, phos-\nphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) (see Chapter 21),\nwhich regulates essential cell functions including signal trans-\nduction and vesicle trafficking, is synthesized by two further\nkinase catalyzed steps (see Figure 24\u20132, lower right). Phosphati-\ndylserine is formed from phosphatidylethanolamine directly by\nreaction with serine. Phosphatidylserine may reform phospha-\ntidylethanolamine by decarboxylation (see Figure 24\u20132, bottom\nleft). An alternative pathway in liver enables phosphatidyletha-\nnolamine to give rise directly to phosphatidylcholine by pro-\ngressive methylation of the ethanolamine residue. Despite these\nendogenous sources of choline, it is considered to be an essential\nnutrient for humans and many other mammalian species.\nThe regulation of triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,\nand phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is driven by the\navailability of free fatty acids. Those not required for oxida-\ntion are preferentially converted to phospholipids, and when\nthis requirement is satisfied, they are used for triacylglycerol\nsynthesis.\nCardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol; see Figure 21\u20139) is\na phospholipid present in mitochondria. It is formed from\nphosphatidylglycerol, which in turn is synthesized from CDP-\ndiacylglycerol (see Figure 24\u20132) and glycerol-3-phosphate.\nCardiolipin, found in the inner membrane of mitochondria,\nhas a key role in mitochondrial structure and function, and\nis also thought to be involved in programmed cell death\n(apoptosis ).Phosphatidylcholine\nPhosphatidylethanolaminePhosphatidylinositol\n4,5-bisphosphateT riacylglycerolDiacylglycerol Phosphatidylinositol CardiolipinPhosphatidateGlycerol-3-phosphate  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate\nPlasmalogens PAF\nFIGURE 24\u20131 Overview of acylglycerol biosynthesis.\n(P\nAF, platelet-activating factor.)"

The\nincorporation of fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine occurs\nin three ways; by complete synthesis of the phospholipid\n(see Figure 24\u20134); by transacylation between cholesteryl\nester and lysophosphatidylcholine; and by direct acylation\nof lysophosphatidylcholine by acyl-CoA. Thus, a continuous\nexchange of the fatty acids is possible, particularly with regard\nto introducing essential fatty acids (see Chapter 21) into phospho-\nlipid molecules.\nALL SPHINGOLIPIDS ARE\nFORMED \nFROM CERAMIDE\nCeramide (see Chapter 21) is synthesized in the endoplasmic\nreticulum from the amino acid serine as shown in Figure 24\u20136 .\nCeramide is an important signaling molecule (second mes-\nsenger) regulating pathways including programmed cell death\n(apoptosis), the cell cycle , and cell differentiation and\nsenescence .\nSphingomyelins (see Figure 21\u201310) are phospholipids and\nare formed when ceramide reacts with phosphatidylcholine to\nform sphingomyelin plus diacylglycerol ( Figure 24\u20137A ).

Adminis-\ntration of either natural or artificial surfactant is of therapeutic\nbenefit.\nPhospholipids & Sphingolipids Are\nInvo\nlved in Multiple Sclerosis &\nLipidoses\nCertain diseases are characterized by abnormal quantities of\nthese \nlipids in the tissues, often in the nervous system. They\nmay be classified into two groups: (1) true demyelinating dis-\neases and (2) sphingolipidoses.\nInmultiple sclerosis , which is a demyelinating disease,\nthere is loss of both phospholipids (particularly ethanolamine\nplasmalogen) and of sphingolipids from white matter. Thus,\nthe lipid composition of white matter resembles that of gray\nmatter. The cerebrospinal fluid shows raised phospholipid\nlevels.\nThesphingolipidoses (lipid storage diseases) are a group\nof inherited diseases that are caused by a genetic defect in the\ncatabolism of lipids containing sphingosine. They are part of a\nlarger group of lysosomal disorders and exhibit several constant\nfeatures: (1) complex lipids containing ceramide accumulate\nin cells, particularly neurons, causing neurodegeneration and\nshortening the life span. (2) The rate of synthesis of the stored\nlipid is normal. (3) The enzymatic defect is in the degradation\npathway of sphingolipids in lysosomes. (4) The extent to which\nthe activity of the affected enzyme is decreased is similar in all\ntissues. There is no effective treatment for many of the dis-\neases, although some success has been achieved with enzyme\nreplacement therapy and bone marrow transplantation in\nthe treatment of Gaucher and Fabry diseases. Other promising\napproaches are substrate deprivation therapy to inhibit the\nsynthesis of sphingolipids and chemical chaperone therapy .Gene therapy for lysosomal disorders is also currently under\ninvestigation. Some examples of the more important lipid stor-\nage diseases are shown in Table 24\u20131 .\nMultiple sulfatase deficiency results in accumulation of\nsulfogalactosylceramide, steroid sulfates, and proteoglycans\nowing to a combined deficiency of arylsulfatases A, B, and C\nand steroid sulfatase. Symptoms include abnormalities in neu-\nrologic and metabolic functions, as well as in hearing, sight,\nand bone. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is characterized by\na build-up of sulfatides in tissues caused by a defect in arylsul-\nfatase A, and leads to irreversible damage to the myelin sheath.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Triacylglycerols and some phosphoglycerols are synthesized\nby \nprogressive acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate.

The simplest\nglycosphingolipids are a combination of ceramide plus a sugar\nresidue (eg, GalCer in myelin). Gangliosides are more complex\nglycosphingolipids containing more sugar residues plus\nsialic acid.

This latter fraction, the FFA, is metabolically\nthe most active of the plasma lipids.\nFour Major Groups of Plasma\nLipoproteins \nHave Been Identified\nSince fat is less dense than water, the density of a lipopro-\ntein \ndecreases as the proportion of lipid to protein increases\n(Table 25\u20131 ). Four major groups of lipoproteins have been iden-\ntified that are important physiologically and in clinical diagnosis.These are (1) chylomicrons , derived from intestinal absorption\nof triacylglycerol and other lipids; (2) VLDL , derived from the\nliver for the export of triacylglycerol; (3) low-density lipo-\nproteins (LDL), responsible for the transport of cholesterol\nin humans and representing a final stage in the catabolism of\nVLDL; and (4) high-density lipoproteins , (HDL), involved in\nreverse cholesterol transport (see later and Chapter 26) and\nalso in VLDL and chylomicron metabolism. Triacylglycerol\nis the predominant lipid in chylomicrons and VLDL, whereas\ncholesterol and phospholipid are the predominant lipids in\nLDL and HDL, respectively (see Table 25\u20131).

Some apolipoproteins are integral and\ncannot be removed (eg, apo B), whereas others are bound to the\nsurface and are free to transfer to other lipoproteins (eg, apos C\nand E). The major apolipoproteins of HDL (\u03b1-lipoprotein)\nare apo As (see Table 25\u20131). The main apolipoprotein of LDL\n(\u03b2-lipoprotein) is apo B (B-100), which is found also in VLDL.\nChylomicrons contain a truncated form of apo B-100, termed\napoB-48 as it constitutes 48% of the full-sized molecule. Apo B-48\nis synthesized in the intestine, while B-100 is synthesized in the\nliver. Apo B-100 is one of the longest single polypeptide chains\nknown, having more than 4500 amino acids and a molecular\nmass of 540,000 Da. To produce Apo B-48, a stop signal is intro-\nduced into the mRNA transcript for apo B-100 by an RNA edit-\ning enzyme. Apos C-I, C-II, and C-III are smaller polypeptides\n(molecular mass 7000-9000 Da) freely transferable between\nseveral different lipoproteins. Apo E, found in VLDL, HDL,\nchylomicrons, and chylomicron remnants, is also freely trans-\nferable; it accounts for 5 to 10% of total VLDL apolipoproteins\nin normal subjects.\nApolipoproteins carry out several roles: (1) they can form\npart of the structure of the lipoprotein, for example, apo B;\n(2) they are enzyme cofactors, for example, C-II for lipopro-\ntein lipase, A-I for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT),\nor enzyme inhibitors, for example, apo A-II and apo C-III for\nlipoprotein lipase, apo C-I for cholesteryl ester transfer protein\n(see Chapter 26); and (3) they act as ligands for interaction\nwith lipoprotein receptors in tissues, for example, apo B-100\nand apo E for the LDL receptor, apo E for the LDL-receptor\u2013\nrelated protein-1 (LRP-1), which recognizes remnant lipopro-\nteins (see later), and apo A-I for the HDL receptor. Apo A-IVis thought to have a role in chylomicron metabolism and may\nalso act as a regulator of satiety and glucose homeostasis, making\nit a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes\nand obesity, while apo D is believed to be an important factor\nin human neurodegenerative disorders.\nFREE FATTY ACIDS ARE RAPIDLY\nMET\nABOLIZED\nThe FFAs (also termed nonesterified fatty acids [NEFAs] or\nunesterified \nfatty acids) arise in the plasma from the break-\ndown of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue or as a result of the\naction of lipoprotein lipase on the plasma triacylglycerols.\nThey are found in combination with albumin , a very effec-\ntive solubilizer. Levels are low in the fully fed condition and\nrise to 0.7 to 0.8 mEq/mL in the starved state. In uncontrolled\ndiabetes mellitus , the level may rise to as much as 2 mEq/mL.\nFFAs are removed from the blood extremely rapidly by the\ntissues and oxidized (fulfilling 25-50% of energy requirements\nin starvation) or esterified to form triacylglycerol. In starva-\ntion, esterified lipids from the circulation or in the tissues are\nalso oxidized, particularly in heart and skeletal muscle cells,\nwhere considerable stores of lipid are found.\nThe FFA uptake by tissues is related directly to the plasma-\nFFA concentration, which in turn is determined by the rate\nof lipolysis in adipose tissue. After dissociation of the fatty\nacid\u2013albumin complex at the plasma membrane, fatty acids\nbind to a membrane fatty acid transport protein that acts\nas a transmembrane cotransporter with Na+. On entering the\ncytosol, \nFFAs are bound by intracellular fatty acid\u2013binding\nproteins . The role of these proteins in intracellular transport is\nthought to be similar to that of serum albumin in extracellular\ntransport of long-chain fatty acids.\nTRIACYLGLYCEROL IS\nTRANSPORTED \nFROM THE\nINTESTINES IN CHYLOMICRONS\n& FROM THE LIVER IN VERY-LOW-\nDENSITY LIPOPROTEINS\nBy definition, chylomicrons are found in chyle formed only by\nthe lymphatic system draining the intestine . They are respon-\nsible for the transport of all dietary lipids into the circulation.\nSmall quantities of VLDL are also to be found in chyle; how-\never, most VLDL in the plasma are of hepatic origin. They are\nthe vehicles of transport of triacylglycerol from the liver to\nthe extrahepatic tissues .\nThere are striking similarities in the mechanisms of for-\nmation of chylomicrons by intestinal cells and of VLDL by\nhepatic parenchymal cells ( Figure 25\u20132 ), perhaps because\u2014\napart from the mammary gland\u2014the intestine and liver are\nthe only tissues from which particulate lipid is secreted.

Fatty acids originating from chylomicron triacylglyc-\nerol are delivered mainly to adipose tissue, heart, and muscle\n(80%), while ~20% goes to the liver. However, the liver does\nnot metabolize native chylomicrons or VLDL significantly ;\nthus, the fatty acids in the liver must be secondary to their\nmetabolism in extrahepatic tissues.\nTriacylglycerols of Chylomicrons &\nVLDL \nAre Hydrolyzed by Lipoprotein\nLipase to Form Remnant Lipoproteins\nLipoprotein lipase is a n enzyme located on the walls of blood\ncapillaries, anchored to the endothelium by negatively charged\nproteoglycan chains of heparan sulfate. It has been found in\nheart, adipose tissue, spleen, lung, renal medulla, aorta, dia-\nphragm, and lactating mammary gland, although it is not active\nin adult liver. It is not normally found in blood; however, fol-\nlowing injection of heparin , lipoprotein lipase is released from\nits heparan sulfate\u2013binding sites into the circulation. Hepatic\nlipase is bound to the sinusoidal surface of liver cells and is\nalso released by heparin. This enzyme, however, does not reactreadily with chylomicrons or VLDL but is involved in chylomi-\ncron remnant and HDL metabolism (see later).\nBoth phospholipids andapo C-II are required as cofactors\nfor lipoprotein lipase activity, while apo A-II andapo C-III\nact as inhibitors. Hydrolysis takes place while the lipoproteins\nare attached to the enzyme on the endothelium. Triacylglyc-\nerol is hydrolyzed progressively through a diacylglycerol to a\nmonoacylglycerol and finally to FFA plus glycerol. Some of the\nreleased FFA return to the circulation, attached to albumin,\nbut the bulk is transported into the tissue (see Figures 25\u20133\nand 25\u20134). Heart lipoprotein lipase has a low Kmfor triacyl-\nglycerol, about one-tenth of that for the enzyme in adipose\ntissue. This enables the delivery of fatty acids from triacylg-\nlycerol to be redirected from adipose tissue to the heart in\nthe starved state when the plasma triacylglycerol decreases.\nA similar redirection to the mammary gland occurs during lac-\ntation, allowing uptake of lipoprotein triacylglycerol fatty acid\nformilk fat synthesis. The VLDL receptor plays an important\npart in the delivery of fatty acids from VLDL triacylglycerol to\nadipocytes by binding VLDL and bringing it into close contact\nwith lipoprotein lipase. In adipose tissue, insulin enhances\nlipoprotein lipase synthesis in adipocytes and its translocation\nto the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium.\nReaction with lipoprotein lipase results in the loss of\n70 to 90% of the triacylglycerol of chylomicrons and in the\nloss of apo C (which returns to HDL) but not apo E, which\nis retained.

Similar changes occur\nto VLDL, with t\nhe formation of VLDL remnants (also called\nintermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) (see Figure 25\u20134).\nThe Liver Is Responsible for the Uptake\nof \nRemnant Lipoproteins\nChylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver by receptor-\nmediated \nendocytosis, and the cholesteryl esters and triacyl-\nglycerols are hydrolyzed and metabolized. Uptake is mediated\nbyapo E (see Figure 25\u20133), via two apo E-dependent receptors,\ntheLDL (apo B-100, E) receptor andLDL receptor\u2013related\nprotein-1 (LRP-1) . Hepatic lipase has a dual role: (1) it acts\nas a ligand to facilitate remnant uptake and (2) it hydrolyzes\nremnant triacylglycerol and phospholipid.\nAfter VLDL has been converted to IDL, the remnant\nparticles may be taken up by the liver directly via the LDL\n(apo B-100, E) receptor, or they may be further metabolized\nto LDL in the circulation. Only one molecule of apo B-100\nis present in each of these lipoprotein particles, and this is\nconserved during the transformations. Thus, each LDL par-\nticle is derived from a single precursor VLDL particle (see\nFigure 25\u20134). In humans, a relatively large proportion of IDL\nforms LDL, accounting for the increased concentrations of\nLDL in humans compared with many other mammals.LDL IS METABOLIZED VIA\nTHE \nLDL RECEPTOR\nThe liver and many extrahepatic tissues express the LD L\n(apo B-100, E) receptor (LDL receptor). It is so designated\nbecause it is specific for apo B-100 but not B-48, which lacks the\ncarboxyl terminal domain of B-100 containing the LDL recep-\ntor ligand, and it also takes up lipoproteins rich in apo E. The\nLDL receptor is found in many tissues in the body, including\nthe liver, arterial wall, ovary, testes, and adrenocortex. A positive\ncorrelation exists between the incidence of atherosclerosis and\nthe plasma concentration of LDL cholesterol. The LDL recep-\ntor is defective in familial hypercholesterolemia , a genetic\ncondition in which blood LDL cholesterol levels are increased,\ncausing premature atherosclerosis (see Table 26\u20131).

A major function of HDL is\nto act as a repository for the apo C and apo E required in the\nmetabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL. Nascent HDL con-\nsists of discoid phospholipid bilayers containing apo A and\nfree cholesterol. These lipoproteins are similar to the particles\nfound in the plasma of patients with a deficiency of the plasma\nenzyme LCAT and in the plasma of patients with obstructive\njaundice . LCAT\u2014and the LCAT activator apo A-I\u2014bind to\nthe discoidal particles, and the surface phospholipid and free\ncholesterol are converted into cholesteryl esters and lysoleci-\nthin (see Chapter 24). The nonpolar cholesteryl esters move\ninto the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer, whereas lysoleci-\nthin is transferred to plasma albumin. Thus, a nonpolar core is\ngenerated, forming a spherical, pseudomicellar HDL covered\nby a surface film of polar lipids and apolipoproteins. This aids\nthe removal of excess unesterified cholesterol from lipopro-\nteins and tissues as described in the following discussion.\nReverse Cholesterol Transport Is a\nMajor \nFunction of HDL\nThe removal of cholesterol from the tissues and its return to the\nliver \nfor excretion is termed reverse cholesterol transport .\nTheclass B scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) is an HDL recep-\ntor with a dual role in this process. In the liver, it binds HDL\nvia apo A-I, and cholesteryl ester is selectively delivered to\nthe cells, although the particle itself, including apo A-I, is not\ntaken up. In the extrahepatic tissues, on the other hand, SR-B1\nmediates the acceptance of cholesterol effluxed from the cells\nby HDL, which then transports it to the liver where it is excreted\nin the bile either as cholesterol or after conversion to bile acids\n(see Figure 25\u20135). HDL3, generated from discoidal HDL by the\naction \nof LCAT, accepts cholesterol from the tissues via the\nSR-B1 and the cholesterol is then esterified by LCAT, increas-\ning the size of the particles to form the less dense HDL2. HDL3\nis \nthen reformed, either after selective delivery of cholesteryl\nester to the liver via the SR-B1 or by hydrolysis of HDL2phos-\npholip\nid and triacylglycerol by hepatic lipase and endothelial\nlipase. This interchange of HDL2and HD L3is called the HDL\ncycl\ne(see Figure 25\u20135). Free apo A-I is released by these pro-\ncesses and forms pre\u03b2-HDL after associating with a minimum\namount of phospholipid and cholesterol. Surplus apo A-I is\ndestroyed in the kidney. A second important mechanism for\nreverse cholesterol transport involves the ATP-binding cas-\nsette transporters A1 (ABCA1) (also called cholesterol efflux\nregulatory protein) and G1 (ABCG1) . These transporters are\nmembers of a family of transporter proteins that couple the\nhydrolysis of ATP to the binding of a substrate, enabling it to\nbe transported across the membrane. ABCG1 mediates the\ntransport of cholesterol from cells to HDL, while ABCA1 pref-\nerentially promotes efflux to poorly lipidated particles such as\npre\u03b2-HDL or apo A-1, which are then converted to HDL3via\ndiscoidal \nHDL (see Figure 25\u20135). Pre\u03b2-HDL is the most potent\nform of HDL inducing cholesterol efflux from the tissues.\nHDL concentrations vary reciprocally with plasma tri-\nacylglycerol concentrations and directly with the activity oflipoprotein lipase. This may be due to surplus surface constit-\nuents, for example, phospholipid and apo A-I, being released\nduring hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL and contribut-\ning toward the formation of pre\u03b2-HDL and discoidal HDL.\nHDL2concen trations are inversely related to the incidence\nof atherosclerosis , possibly because they reflect the efficiency\nof reverse cholesterol transport. HDLc(HDL1) is found in the\nblood of \ndiet-induced hypercholesterolemic animals. It is rich\nin cholesterol, and its sole apolipoprotein is apo E. It appears\nthat all plasma lipoproteins are interrelated components of\none or more metabolic cycles that together are responsible for\nthe complex process of plasma lipid transport.\nTHE LIVER PLAYS A CENTRAL\nROLE \nIN LIPID TRANSPORT &\nMETABOLISM\nThe liver is responsible for a number of major functions in\nlipid \nmetabolism including:\n1.Facilitation of the digestion and absorption of lipids by the\nproduction of bile(see Chapter 26).\n2.Active synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids (see Chapters 22\nand 23) and also synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospho-\nlipids (see Chapter 24).\n3. Conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies (ketogenesis)\n(see Chapter 22).\n4. Synthesis and metabolism of plasma lipoproteins .\nHepatic VLDL Secretion Is Related to\nDietary \n& Hormonal Status\nThe cellular events involved in hepatic VLDL formation and\nsecretion are sh\nown in Figure 25\u20136 . VLDL assembly requires\nthe synthesis of apo B-100 and a source of triacylglycerol.\nApo B-100 is synthesized on polyribosomes and translocated to\nthe lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as it is formed.\nAs the protein enters the lumen, it is lipidated with phospho-\nlipid with the aid of the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer\nprotein (MTP) , which also facilitates the transfer of triacylglyc-\nerol across the ER membrane, and apo B\u2013containing VLDL2\n(or precursor VLDL) particles are formed. The triacylglycerol\nis derived from lipolysis of cytosolic triacylglycerol lipid drop-\nlets (this pool of triacylglycerol is formed using FFA either\nsynthesized de novo or taken up from the plasma, see later) fol-\nlowed by reesterification in a pathway requiring phospholipid\nderivatives and diacylglycerol acyl transferases. Triacylglyc-\nerol not used for VLDL1 formation is recycled to the cytosolic\ndroplets. After assembly in the ER, VLDL2 are carried in coat\nprotein II (COPII) vesicles (see Chapter 49) to the golgi, where\nthey fuse with triacylglycerol-rich lipid droplets to produce\nVLDL1 .

These nascent VLDL then acquire apolipoproteins C\nand E from HDL in the circulation to become mature VLDL.\nTriacylglycerol for VLDL formation is synthesized from\nFFA. The fatty acids used are derived from two possible sources:\n(1) de novo synthesis within the liver from acetyl-CoA derived\nmainly from carbohydrate (perhaps not so important in\nhumans) and (2) uptake of FFA from the circulation. The first\nsource is predominant in the well-fed condition, when fatty\nacid synthesis is high and the level of circulating FFAs is low.\nAs triacylglycerol does not normally accumulate in the liver in\nthese conditions, it must be inferred that it is transported from\nthe liver in VLDL as rapidly as it is synthesized. FFAs from the\ncirculation are the main source during starvation, the feeding of\nhigh-fat diets, or in diabetes mellitus, when hepatic lipogenesis\nis inhibited. Factors that enhance both the synthesis of triacyl-\nglycerol and the secretion of VLDL by the liver include (1) the\nfed state rather than the starved state; (2) the feeding of diets\nhigh in carbohydrate (particularly if they contain sucrose or\nfructose), leading to high rates of lipogenesis and esterification\nof fatty acids; (3) high levels of circulating FFA; (4) ingestion of\nethanol; and (5) the presence of high concentrations of insulin\nand low concentrations of glucagon, which enhance fatty acid\nsynthesis and esterification and inhibit their oxidation.\nInsulin suppresses hepatic VLDL secretion by inhibiting\nboth apo B-100 synthesis and the conversion of the smaller\nVLDL2 into VLDL1 by fusion with bulk triacylglycerol. Someother factors which are known to inhibit or prevent VLDL\nassembly in the liver include the antibiotic brefeldin A, which\ninhibits the action of ARF-1; the sulfonylurea hypoglycemic\ndrug, tolbutamide, dietary \u03c93 fatty acids (see Chapter 21),\nand orotic acid, an intermediate in the synthesis of pyrimi-\ndines (see Chapter 33), all of which decrease the rate of triacyl-\nglycerol lipolysis; and a defect in the MTP gene, which lowers\nMTP levels. The regulation of VLDL formation in the liver\nis complex and involves interactions between hormonal and\ndietary factors that are not yet fully understood.\nCLINICAL ASPECTS\nImbalance in the Rate of Triacylglycerol\nForma\ntion & Export Causes Fatty Liver\nFor a variety of reasons, lipid\u2014mainly as triacylglycerol\u2014can\naccumulat\ne in the liver.

Theoretically, the lesion\nmay be due to (1) a block in apolipoprotein synthesis (or an\nincrease in its degradation before it can be incorporated into\nVLDL), (2) a block in the synthesis of the lipoprotein from\nlipid and apolipoprotein, (3) a failure in provision of phos-\npholipids that are found in lipoproteins, or (4) a failure in the\nsecretory mechanism itself.\nOne type of fatty liver that has been studied extensively in\nrats is caused by a deficiency of choline , which has therefore\nbeen called a lipotropic factor .Orotic acid also causes fatty\nliver; it is believed to interfere with glycosylation of VLDL,\nthus inhibiting release, and may also impair the recruitment\nof triacylglycerol to the particles. A deficiency of vitamin E\nenhances the hepatic necrosis of the choline deficiency type of\nfatty liver. Added vitamin E or a source of selenium has a pro-\ntective effect by combating lipid peroxidation. In addition to\nprotein deficiency, essential fatty acid and vitamin deficiencies\n(eg, linoleic acid, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid) can cause\nfatty infiltration of the liver.\nEthanol Also Causes Fatty Liver\nAlcoholic fatty liver is th e first stage in alcoholic liver disease\n(ALD) which is caused by alcoholism and ultimately leads to\ncirrhosis . The fat accumulation in the liver is caused by a com-\nbination of impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased lipo-\ngenesis, which is thought to be due to changes in the [NADH]/\n[NAD+] redox potential in the liver, and also to interference\nwit\nh the action of transcription factors regulating the expres-\nsion of the enzymes involved in the pathways. Oxidation of\nethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase leads to excess production\nof NADH, which competes with reducing equivalents from\nother substrates, including fatty acids, for the respiratory chain.\nThis inhibits their oxidation and causes increased esterification\nof fatty acids to form triacylglycerol, resulting in the fatty liver.\nOxidation of ethanol leads to the formation of acetaldehyde,\nwhich is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase , producing acetate.\nThe increased (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio also causes increased\n(lacta\nte)/(pyruvate), resulting in hyperlacticacidemia , which\ndecreases excretion of uric acid, aggravating gout.\nSome metabolism of ethanol takes place via a cytochrome\nP450\u2013dependent microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)\ninvolving NADPH and O2. This system increases in activity\ninchronic \nalcoholism and may account for the increased\nmetabolic clearance of ethanol in this condition, but may alsopromote the development of ALD. Ethanol also inhibits the\nmetabolism of some drugs, for example, barbiturates, by com-\npeting for cytochrome P450\u2013dependent enzymes.\nIn some Asian populations and Native Americans, alcohol\nconsumption results in increased adverse reactions to acetal-\ndehyde owing to a genetic defect of mitochondrial aldehyde\ndehydrogenase.\nADIPOSE TISSUE IS THE MAIN\nSTORE\n OF TRIACYLGLYCEROL\nIN THE BODY\nTriacylglycerols are stored in adipose tissue in large lipid\ndropl\nets and are continually undergoing lipolysis (hydrolysis)\nand reesterification. These two processes are entirely differ-\nent pathways involving different reactants and enzymes. This\nallows the processes of esterification or lipolysis to be regu-\nlated separately by many nutritional, metabolic, and hormonal\nfactors. The balance between these two processes determines\nthe magnitude of the FFA pool in adipose tissue, which in turn\ndetermines the level of FFA circulating in the plasma. Since\nthe latter has most profound effects on the metabolism of\nother tissues, particularly liver and muscle, the factors oper-\nating in adipose tissue that regulate the outflow of FFA exert\nan influence far beyond the tissue itself. Moreover, since the\ndiscovery in the last 20 years that adipose tissue secretes hor-\nmones such as leptin andadiponectin , known as adipokines ,\nits role as an endocrine organ has been recognized. Leptin\nregulates energy homeostasis by stimulating energy use and\nlimiting food intake. If it is lacking, food intake may be uncon-\ntrolled, causing obesity. Adiponectin modulates glucose and\nlipid metabolism in muscle and liver, and enhances the sensi-\ntivity of tissues to insulin.\nThe Provision of Glycerol-3-Phosphate\nRegulates \nEsterification: Lipolysis\nIs Controlled by Hormone-Sensitive\nLipase\nTriacylglycerol is synthesized from acyl-CoA and glycerol-\n3-phospha\nte (see Figure 24\u20132). Since the enzyme glycerol\nkinase is not expressed in adipose tissue, glycerol cannot be\nutilized for the provision of glycerol-3-phosphate, which must\nbe supplied from glucose via glycolysis ( Figure 25\u20137 ).\nTriacylglycerol undergoes hydrolysis by a hormone-\nsensitive lipase to form FFA and glycerol. This lipase is distinct\nfrom lipoprotein lipase, which catalyzes lipoprotein triacyl-\nglycerol hydrolysis before its uptake into extrahepatic tissues\n(see earlier). Since the glycerol cannot be utilized, it enters the\nblood and is taken up and transported to tissues such as\nthe liver and kidney, which possess an active glycerol kinase.\nThe FFA formed by lipolysis can be reconverted in adipose tis-\nsue to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase and reesterified with\nglycerol-3-phosphate to form triacylglycerol. Thus, there is a\ncontinuous cycle of lipolysis and reesterification within the"

However, the release of glycerol\ncontinues, demonstrating that the effect of glucose is not medi-\nated by reducing the rate of lipolysis. The effect is due to the\nincreased provision of glycerol-3-phosphate, which enhancesesterification of FFA. Glucose can take several pathways in adi-\npose tissue, including oxidation to CO2via acetyl-CoA and the\ncitric acid cycle, oxidation in the pentose phosphate pathway,\nconversion to long-chain fatty acids (via acyl-CoA), and forma-\ntion of acylglycerol via glycerol-3-phosphate (see Figure 25\u20137).\nWhen glucose utilization is high, a larger proportion of the\nuptake is oxidized to CO2and converted to fatty acids. However,\nas total glucose utilization decreases, the greater proportion of\nthe glucose is directed to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate\nfor the esterification of acyl-CoA to form triacylglycerol, which\nhelps to minimize the efflux of FFA.\nHORMONES REGULATE FAT\nMOBILIZA\nTION\nAdipose Tissue Lipolysis Is Inhibited\nby \nInsulin\nThe rate of release of FFA from adipose tissue is affected by\nman\ny hormones that influence either the rate of esterifica-\ntion or the rate of lipolysis. Insulin inhibits the release of\nFFA from adipose tissue, which results in a fall in circulating\nplasma FFA. Insulin also enhances lipogenesis and the syn-\nthesis of acylglycerol and increases the oxidation of glucose to\nCO2via the  pentose phosphate pathway. All of these effects are\ndependent on the presence of glucose and can be explained, to\na large extent, on the basis of the ability of insulin to enhance\nthe uptake of glucose into adipose cells via the GLUT 4\ntransporter . In addition, insulin increases the activity of the\nenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase,\nand glycerol phosphate acyltransferase, reinforcing the effects\nof increased glucose uptake on the enhancement of fatty acid\nand acylglycerol synthesis. These three enzymes are regulated\nin a coordinate manner by phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation\nmechanisms (see Chapters 17, 23, and 24).\nAnother principal action of insulin in adipose tissue is to\ninhibit the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase , reducing the\nrelease not only of FFA but also of glycerol. Adipose tissue is\nmuch more sensitive to insulin than many other tissues, and is\nthus a major site of insulin action in vivo.\nSeveral Hormones Promote Lipolysis\nOther hormones accelerate the release of FFA from adipose\ntissue \nand raise the plasma-free fatty acid concentration by\nincreasing the rate of lipolysis of the triacylglycerol stores\n(Figure 25\u20138 ). These include epinephrine, norepinephrine,\nglucagon, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-\nstimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH) . Many\nof these activate hormone-sensitive lipase. For an optimal\neffect, most of these lipolytic processes require the presence of\nglucocorticoids andthyroid hormones . These hormones act\nin afacilitatory orpermissive capacity with respect to other\nlipolytic endocrine factors.\nThe hormones that act rapidly in promoting lipolysis, that\nis, catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), do so byFIGURE 25\u20137 Triacylglycerol metabolism in adipose tissue.\nHormone\n-sensitive lipase is activated by ACTH, TSH, glucagon, epi-\nnephrine and norepinephrine, and inhibited by insulin, prostaglandin\nE1, and nicotinic acid.

Thus, processes\nwhich destroy or preserve cAMP influence lipolysis. cAMP\nis degraded to 5 \u2032-AMP by the enzyme cyclic 3 \u2032,5\u2032-nucleotide\nphosphodiesterase . This enzyme is inhibited by methylxan-\nthines such as caffeine andtheophylline .Insulin antagonizes\nthe effect of the lipolytic hormones. Lipolysis appears to be\nmore sensitive to changes in concentration of insulin than are\nglucose utilization and esterification. The antilipolytic effects\nof insulin, as well as those of nicotinic acid and prostaglandin\nE1which also act in this way, are accounted for by inhibition\nof the synthesis of cAMP at the adenylyl cyclase site, acting\nthrough a Gipro tein. Insulin also stimulates the phosphodi-\nesterase and the lipase phosphatase that inactivates hormone-\nsensitive lipase. The effect of growth hormone in promoting\nlipolysis is dependent on synthesis of proteins involved in the\nformation of cAMP . Glucocorticoids promote lipolysis via syn-\nthesis of new lipase protein by a cAMP-independent pathway,\nwhich may be inhibited by insulin, and also by promoting tran-\nscription of genes involved in the cAMP signal cascade.

Cholesterol is an\namphipathic lipid and as such is an essential structural com-\nponent of membranes, where it is important for the mainte-\nnance of the correct permeability and fluidity (see Chapter 40),\nand of the outer layer of plasma lipoproteins. It is synthesized\nin many tissues from acetyl-CoA and is the precursor of allother steroids in the body, including corticosteroids, sex hor-\nmones, bile acids, andvitamin D .

However, its\nchief role in pathologic processes is as a factor in the develop-\nment of atherosclerosis of vital arteries, causing cerebrovas-\ncular, coronary, and peripheral vascular disease.\nCHOLESTEROL IS\nBIOSYNTHESIZED\nFROM \nACETYL-CoA\nA little more than half the cholesterol of the body arises by\nsynthesis \n(about 700 mg/d), and the remainder is provided by\nthe average diet. The liver and intestine account for approxi-\nmately 10% each of total synthesis in humans. Virtually all\ntissues containing nucleated cells are capable of cholesterol\nsynthesis, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and the\ncytosolic compartments.\nAcetyl-CoA Is the Source of All\nCarbon \nAtoms in Cholesterol\nCholesterol is a 27-carbon compound consisting of four rings\nan\nd a side chain (see Figure 21\u201319). It is synthesized from acetyl-\nCoA by a lengthy pathway that may be divided into five steps:\n(1) synthesis of mevalonate from acetyl-CoA ( Figure 26\u20131 );\n(2) formation of isoprenoid units from mevalonate by loss of\nCO2(Figure 26\u20132 ); (3) condensation of six isoprenoid units\nform squalene (see Figure 26\u20132); (4) cyclization of squalene gives\nrise to the parent steroid, lanosterol (Figure 26\u20133) ; (5) formation\nof cholesterol from lanosterol (see Figure 26\u20133).\nStep 1\u2014Biosynthesis of Mevalonate: HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-\n3-methylglutaryl-CoA) is formed by the reactions used in\nmitochondria to synthesize ketone bodies (see Figure 22\u20137).\nHowever, since cholesterol synthesis is extramitochondrial, the\ntwo pathways are distinct. Initially, two molecules of acetyl-\nCoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA catalyzed by cytosolic\nthiolase . Acetoacetyl-CoA condenses with a further molecule\nof acetyl-CoA catalyzed by HMG-CoA synthase to form\nHMG-CoA, which is reduced to mevalonate by NADPH in\na reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase . This last step\nis the principal regulatory step in the pathway of cholesterol\nsynthesis and is the site of action of the most effective class of\ncholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, which are HMG-CoA\nreductase inhibitors (see Figure 26\u20131).\nStep 2\u2014Formation of Isoprenoid Units: Mevalonate is\nphosphorylated sequentially using ATP by three kinases, and\nafter decarboxylation (see Figure 26\u20132) of the active isoprenoid\nunit, isopentenyl diphosphate , is formed.\nStep 3\u2014Six Isoprenoid Units Form Squalene: Isopentenyl\ndiphosphate is isomerized by a shift of the double bond to form\ndimethylallyl diphosphate , and then condensed with another\nmolecule of isopentenyl diphosphate to form the 10-carbon\nintermediate geranyl diphosphate (see Figure 26\u20132). A fur-\nther condensation with isopentenyl diphosphate forms farnesyl\ndiphosphate . Two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate condenseat the diphosphate end to form squalene . Initially, inorganic\npyrophosphate is eliminated, forming presqualene diphosphate,\nwhich is then reduced by NADPH with elimination of a further\ninorganic pyrophosphate molecule. Farnesyl diphosphate is\nalso an intermediate in the formation of other important com-\npounds which contain isoprenoid units such as dolichol and\nubiquinone (see following discussion and Figure 26\u20132).\nStep 4\u2014Formation of Lanosterol: Squalene can fold\ninto a structure that closely resembles the steroid nucleus\n(see Figure 26\u20133). Before ring closure occurs, squalene is\nconverted to squalene 2,3-epoxide by squalene epoxidase,\na mixed-function oxidase in the endoplasmic reticulum. The\nmethyl group on C14is transferred to C13and that on C8to C14\nas cycliz\nation occurs, catalyzed by oxidosqualene-lanosterol\ncyclase .\nStep 5\u2014Formation of Cholesterol: The formation of\ncholesterol from lanosterol takes place in the membranes of\nthe endoplasmic reticulum and involves changes in the ste-\nroid nucleus and the side chain (see Figure 26\u20133). The methyl\ngroups on C14and C4ar e removed to form 14-desmethyl lanos-\nterol and then zymosterol. The double bond at C8\u2014C9is sub-\nsequen\ntly moved to C5\u2014C6in tw o steps, forming desmosterol\n(24-dehydrocholesterol) .

An increase in cell cholesterol may\nbe caused by: (1) Uptake of cholesterol-containing lipopro-\nteins by receptors, for example, the LDL receptor or scavenger\nreceptors such as CD36. (2) Uptake of free cholesterol from\ncholesterol-rich lipoproteins to the cell membrane. (3) Cho-\nlesterol synthesis. (4) Hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters by the\nenzyme cholesteryl ester hydrolase . A decrease may be due\nto: (1) Efflux of cholesterol from the membrane to HDL via\nthe ABCA1, ABCG1, or SR-B1 (see Figure 25\u20135). (2) Esteri-\nfication of cholesterol by ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl-\ntransferase).

The glycoprotein receptor spans the\nmembrane, the B-100 binding region being at the exposed\namino terminal end. After binding, LDL is taken up intact by\nendocytosis . The apoprotein and cholesteryl ester are then\nhydrolyzed in the lysosomes, and cholesterol is translocated\ninto the cell. The receptors are recycled to the cell surface.\nThis influx of cholesterol inhibits the transcription of the\ngenes encoding HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase,\nand other enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, as well\nas the LDL receptor itself, via the SREBP pathway, and thus\ncoordinately suppresses cholesterol synthesis and uptake.\nACAT activity is also stimulated, promoting cholesterol esteri-\nfication.

Dietary cholesterol equilibrates with plasma\ncholesterol in days and with tissue cholesterol in weeks. Cho-\nlesteryl ester in the diet is hydrolyzed to cholesterol, which is\nthen absorbed by the intestine together with dietary unesteri-\nfied cholesterol and other lipids.

Of the cholesterol absorbed, 80 to 90% is esterified\nwith long-chain fatty acids in the intestinal mucosa. Ninety-five\npercent of the chylomicron cholesterol is delivered to the liver\nin chylomicron remnants, and most of the cholesterol secreted\nby the liver in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is retained\nduring the formation of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)\nand ultimately LDL, which is taken up by the LDL receptor in\nliver and extrahepatic tissues (see Chapter 25).Plasma LCAT Is Responsible for\nVirtually \nAll Plasma Cholesteryl Ester\nin Humans\nLecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity is asso-\nciated with HDL containing apo A-I.

Coprostanol is the principal sterol in the feces; it is\nformed from cholesterol by the bacteria in the lower intestine.\nBile Acids Are Formed from Cholesterol\nThe primary bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cho-\nlesterol. These are cholic acid (found in the largest amount in\nmost mammals) and chenodeoxycholic acid (Figure 26\u20137 ).\nThe 7\u03b1-hydroxylation of cholesterol is the first and principal\nregulatory step in the biosynthesis of bile acids and is catalyzed\nbycholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase , a microsomal cytochrome\nP450 enzyme\u2013designated CYP7A1 (see Chapter 12).

This is known as the enterohepatic circulation (see\nFigure 26\u20136). However, lithocholic acid, because of its insolu-\nbility, is not reabsorbed to any significant extent. Only a small\nfraction of the bile acids escapes absorption and is therefore\neliminated in the feces. Nonetheless, this represents a major\npathway for the elimination of cholesterol.

Elevated plasma cholesterol levels (>5.2 mmol/L) are\none of the most important factors in promoting atherosclero-\nsis, but it is now recognized that elevated blood triacylglycerol\nis also an independent risk factor. Diseases in which there is a\nprolonged elevation of levels of VLDL, IDL, chylomicron rem-\nnants, or LDL in the blood (eg, diabetes mellitus, lipid nephro-\nsis, hypothyroidism, andother conditions of hyperlipidemia )\nare often accompanied by premature or more severe athero-\nsclerosis. There is also an inverse relationship between HDL\n(HDL2) concentrations and coronary heart disease, making the\nLD\nL:HDL cholesterol ratio a good predictive parameter . This\nis consistent with the function of HDL in reverse cholesterol\ntransport. Susceptibility to atherosclerosis varies widely among\nspecies, and humans are one of the few in which the disease can\nbe induced by diets high in cholesterol.\nDiet Can Play an Important Role in\nReducing \nSerum Cholesterol\nHereditary factors play the most important role in determining\nthe \nserum cholesterol concentrations of individuals; however,\ndietary and environmental factors also play a part, and the most\nbeneficial of these is the substitution in the diet of polyunsat-\nurated andmonounsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty\nacids. Plant oils such as corn oil and sunflower seed oil contain\na high proportion of \u03c96 polyunsaturated fatty acids, while olive\noil contains a high concentration of monounsaturated fatty\nacids. \u03c93 fatty acids found in fish oils are also beneficial (see\nChapter 21). On the other hand, butter fat, beef fat, and palm oil\ncontain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sucrose and\nfructose have a greater effect in raising blood lipids, particularly\ntriacylglycerols, than do other carbohydrates.\nOne of the mechanisms by which unsaturated fatty acids\nlower blood cholesterol levels is by the upregulation of LDL\nreceptors on the cell surface, causing an increase in the catabolic\nrate of LDL, the main atherogenic lipoprotein. In addition, \u03c93\nfatty acids have anti-inflammatory and triacylglycerol-lowering\neffects. Saturated fatty acids also cause the formation of smaller\nVLDL particles that contain relatively more cholesterol, and they\nare utilized by extrahepatic tissues at a slower rate than are larger\nparticles\u2014tendencies that may be regarded as atherogenic.\nLifestyle Affects the Serum\nCholesterol \nLevel\nAdditional factors considered to play a part in coronary heart\ndisease include high blood pressure, smoking, male gender\n,obesity (particularly abdominal obesity), lack of exercise,\nand drinking soft as opposed to hard water . Factors associ-\nated with elevation of plasma-free fatty acids (FFAs) followed\nby increased output of triacylglycerol and cholesterol into\nthe circulation in VLDL include emotional stress and cof-\nfee drinking . Premenopausal women appear to be protected\nagainst many of these deleterious factors, and this is thought\nto be related to the beneficial effects of estrogen . There is an\nassociation between moderate alcohol consumption and a\nlower incidence of coronary heart disease. This may be due\nto elevation of HDL concentrations resulting from increased\nsynthesis of apo A-I and changes in activity of cholesteryl ester\ntransfer protein. It has been claimed that red wine is particu-\nlarly beneficial, perhaps because of its content of antioxidants.\nRegular exercise lowers plasma LDL but raises HDL. Triacyl-\nglycerol concentrations are also reduced, due most likely to\nincreased insulin sensitivity, which enhances the expression of\nlipoprotein lipase.\nWhen Diet Changes Fail, Hypolipidemic\nDrugs \nCan Reduce Serum Cholesterol &\nTriacylglycerol\nA family of drugs known as statins hav e proved highly effi-\ncacious in lowering plasma cholesterol and preventing heart\ndisease. Statins act by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and\nupregulating LDL receptor activity. Examples currently in use\ninclude atorvastatin ,simvastatin ,fluvastatin , and pravas-\ntatin .Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting\nthe absorption of cholesterol by the intestine via blockage of\nuptake by the Niemann-Pick C-like 1 protein . Other drugs\nused include fibrates such as clofibrate ,gemfibrozil , and nic-\notinic acid , which act mainly to lower plasma triacylglycerols\nby decreasing the secretion of triacylglycerol and cholesterol-\ncontaining VLDL by the liver. Since PCSK9 reduces the num-\nber of LDL receptors exposed on the cell membrane, it has\nthe effect of raising blood cholesterol levels, thus drugs that\ninhibit its activity are potentially antiatherogenic and two such\ncompounds, alirocumab andevolocumab , have recently been\napproved for use and others are currently in development.\nPrimary Disorders of the Plasma\nLipoproteins \n(Dyslipoproteinemias)\nAre Inherited\nInherited defects in lipoprotein metabolism lead to the pri-\nmary \ncondition of either hypo- orhyperlipoproteinemia\n(Table 26\u20131 ). For example, familial hypercholesterolemia\n(FH) , causes severe hypercholesterolemia and is associated\nwith premature atherosclerosis. The defect is most often in the\ngene for the LDL receptor, so that LDL is not cleared from the\nblood. In addition, diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypo-\nthyroidism, kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome), and athero-\nsclerosis are associated with secondary abnormal lipoprotein\npatterns that are similar to one or another of the primary\ninherited conditions.

A much more common clinical\ncondition is jaundice , a consequence o\ue03e an elevated level o\ue03e\nplasma bilirubin, due either to overproduction o\ue03e bilirubin\nor to \ue03eailure o\ue03e its excretion. Jaundice occurs in numerous\ndiseases ranging \ue03erom hemolytic anemias to viral hepatitis\nand to cancer o\ue03e the pancreas.\nPORPHYRINS\nPorphyrins are  cyclic compounds \ue03eormed by the linkage\no\ue03e \ue03eour pyrrole rings through methyne ( \u2014\u2014HC\u2014) bridges\n(Figure 31\u20131 ).

Examples include iron porphyrins such as the\nheme o\ue03e hemoglobin and the magnesium-containing porphy-\nrinchlorophyll , the photosynthetic pigment o\ue03e plants. Heme\nproteins are ubiquitous in biology and serve diverse \ue03eunctions\nincluding, but not limited to, oxygen transport and storage\n(eg, hemoglobin and myoglobin) and electron transport (eg,\ncytochrome c and cytochrome P450). Hemes are tetrapyr-\nroles , o\ue03e which two types, heme band heme c, predominate\n(Figure 31\u20132 ). In heme cthe vinyl groups o\ue03e heme bare\nreplaced by covalent thioether links to an apoprotein, typically\nvia cysteinyl residues. Unlike heme b, heme cthus does not\nreadily dissociate \ue03erom its apoprotein.\nProteins that contain heme are widely distributed in nature\n(Table 31\u20131 ).

A 70-kg human there\ue03eore turns over approximately\n6 g of hemoglobin daily. All products are reused. \ue034he globin\nis degraded to its constituent amino acids, and the released\niron enters the iron pool. \ue034he iron-\ue03eree porphyrin portion o\ue03e\nheme is also degraded, mainly in the reticuloendothelial cells\no\ue03e the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.\n\ue034he catabolism o\ue03e heme \ue03erom all heme proteins takes\nplace in the microsomal fraction o\ue03e cells by heme oxygenase ,\nEC 1.14.18.18.

Birds and amphibians excrete the green-colored bili-\nverdin directly. In humans, biliverdin reductase (EC 1.3.1.24)\nreduces the central methylene bridge o\ue03e biliverdin to a methyl\ngroup, producing the yellow-pigment bilirubin (Figure 31\u201311 ):\nBiliverdin + NADPH + H+\u2192bilirubin + NADP+\nSince 1 g o\ue03e hemoglobin yields about 35 mg o\ue03e bilirubin,\nhuma\nn adults form 250 to 350 mg of bilirubin per day. \ue034his\nis derived principally \ue03erom hemoglobin, and also \ue03erom ine\ue03e\ue03eec-\ntive erythropoiesis and \ue03erom catabolism o\ue03e other heme proteins.\nConversion o\ue03e heme to bilirubin by reticuloendothe-\nlial cells can be observed visually as the purple color o\ue03e the\nheme in a hematoma slowly converts to the yellow pigment\no\ue03e bilirubin.\nBilirubin Is Transported to the Liver\nBound \nto Serum Albumin\nBilirubin is only sparingly soluble in water.

Subsequent\nreduction by the \ue03eecal \ue03elora \ue03eorms a group o\ue03e colorless tetra-\npyrroles called urobilinogens . Small portions o\ue03e urobilino-\ngens are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and large intestine\nand subsequently are reexcreted via the enterohepatic urobi-\nlinogen cycle . Under abnormal conditions, particularly when\nexcessive bile pigment is \ue03eormed or when liver disease disrupts\nthis intrahepatic cycle, urobilinogen may also be excreted in\nthe urine. Most o\ue03e the colorless urobilinogens \ue03eormed in the\ncolon are oxidized there to colored urobilins and excreted in\nthe \ue03eeces.

In\nthe absence o\ue03e hepatic damage, obstruction o\ue03e the excretory\nducts o\ue03e the liver prevents the excretion o\ue03e bilirubin, and will\nalso cause hyperbilirubinemia. In all these situations, when\nthe blood concentration o\ue03e bilirubin reaches 2 to 2.5 mg/dL, it\ndi\ue03e\ue03euses into the tissues, which turn yellow, a condition termed\njaundice oricterus .\nOccurrence of Unconjugated Bilirubin\nin \nBlood\nForms o\ue03e hyperbilirubinemia include reten tion hyperbiliru-\nbinemia due to overproduction o\ue03e bilirubin, and regurgita-\ntion hyperbilirubinemia due to re\ue03elux into the bloodstream\nbecause o\ue03e biliary obstruction.\nBecause o\ue03e its hydrophobicity , only unconjugated bilirubin\ncan cross the blood\u2013brain barrier into the central nervous sys-\ntem.

Accordingly,\ncholuric jaundice (choluria is the presence o\ue03e bile pigments\nin the urine) occurs only in regurgitation hyperbilirubine-\nmia, and acholuric jaundice occurs only in the presence o\ue03e an\nexcess o\ue03e unconjugated bilirubin.

Syndromes whose clinical\npresentation re\ue03elects the severity o\ue03e the impairment include\nGilbert syndrome and two types o\ue03e Crigler-Najjar syndrome.\nGilbert Syndrome\nProviding that about 30% o\ue03e the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl-\ntrans\ue03eerase \nactivity is retained in Gilbert syndrome, the condi-\ntion is harmless.\nType I Crigler-Najjar Syndrome\n\ue034he severe congenital jaundice (over 20 mg bilirubin per dL\nserum) \nand accompanying brain damage o\ue03e type I Crigler-\nNajjar syndrome re\ue03elect the complete absence o\ue03e hepatic\nUDP-glucuronosyltrans\ue03eerase activity.

Serum bilirubintends not to exceed 20 mg/dL o\ue03e serum, and patients respond\nto treatment with large doses o\ue03e phenobarbital.\nToxic Hyperbilirubinemia\nUnconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result \ue03erom toxin-\ninduced liver dysfunction caused by, \ue03eor example, chloro-\n\ue03eorm, arsphenamines, carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen,\nhepatitis virus, cirrhosis, or Amanita mushroom poisoning.\n\ue034hese acquired disorders involve hepatic parenchymal cell\ndamage, which impairs bilirubin conjugation.\nObstruction in the Biliary Tree Is the\nMost \nCommon Cause of Conjugated\nHyperbilirubinemia\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia common ly results \ue03erom\nblockage o\ue03e the hepatic or common bile ducts, most o\ue03eten\ndue to a gallstone or to cancer of the head of the pancreas\n(Figure 31\u201314 ).

Some patients there\ue03eore\ncontinue to appear jaundiced even a\ue03eter the circulating conju-\ngated bilirubin level has returned to normal.\nUrinary Urobilinogen & Bilirubin Are\nClinical \nIndicators\nIncomplete obstruction of the bile duct , bilirubin has no\naccess to the intestine \ue03eor conversion to urobilinogen, so no\nurobilinogen is present in the urine. \ue034he presence o\ue03e conju-\ngated bilirubin in the urine without urobilinogen suggests\nintrahepatic or posthepatic obstructive jaundice.\nInjaundice secondary to hemolysis , the increased pro-\nduction o\ue03e bilirubin leads to increased production o\ue03e urobilin-\nogen , which appears in the urine in large amounts. Bilirubin\nis not usually \ue03eound in the urine in hemolytic jaundice, so\nthe combination o\ue03e increased urobilinogen and absence o\ue03e\nbilirubin is suggestive o\ue03e hemolytic jaundice. Increased blood\ndestruction \ue03erom any cause brings about an increase in urine\nurobilinogen.\nTable 31\u20134 summarizes laboratory results obtained in\npatients with jaundice due to prehepatic, hepatic, or pos-\nthepatic causes: hemolytic anemia (prehepatic), hepatitis\n(hepatic), and obstruction of the common bile duct (posthe-\npatic); see Figure 31\u201314. Laboratory tests on blood (evalua-\ntion o\ue03e the possibility o\ue03e a hemolytic anemia and measuremento\ue03e prothrombin time) and on serum (eg, electrophoresis o\ue03e\nproteins; alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotrans\ue03eerase\nand aspartate aminotrans\ue03eerase activities) also help to distin-\nguish between prehepatic, hepatic, and posthepatic causes o\ue03e\njaundice.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Te heme o\ue03e hemoproteins such as hemoglobin and the\ncytochromes \nis an iron-porphyrin complex. Porphyrin consists\no\ue03e \ue03eour pyrrole rings joined by methyne bridges.\n\u25a0Te eight methyl, vinyl, and propionyl substituents on the \ue03eour\npyrrole \nrings o\ue03e heme are arranged in a speci\ue005c sequence. Te\nmetal ion (Fe2+in hem oglobin; Mg2+in c hlorophyll) is linked to\nthe \ue03eour nitrogen atoms o\ue03e the pyrrole rings.\n\u25a0Biosynthesis o\ue03e the heme ring involves eight enzyme-catalyzed\nreactions, \nsome o\ue03e which occur in mitochondria, others in the\ncytosol.\n\u25a0Synthesis o\ue03e heme commences with the condensation o\ue03e\nsuccinyl-CoA \nand glycine to \ue03eorm ALA. Tis reaction\nis catalyzed by ALAS1, the regulatory enzyme o\ue03e heme\nbiosynthesis.\n\u25a0Synthesis o\ue03e ALAS1 increases in response to a low level o\ue03e\navailab\nle heme. For example, certain drugs (eg, phenobarbital)\nindirectly trigger enhanced synthesis o\ue03e ALAS1 by promoting\nsynthesis o\ue03e the heme protein cytochrome P450, which thereby\ndepletes the heme pool. By contrast, ALAS2 is not regulated\nby heme levels, and consequently not by drugs that promote\nsynthesis o\ue03e cytochrome P450.\n\u25a0Genetic abnormalities o\ue03e seven o\ue03e the eight enzymes o\ue03e heme\nbiosynthesis \nresult in inherited porphyrias. Erythrocytes\nand liver are the major sites o\ue03e expression o\ue03e the porphyrias.\nPhotosensitivity and neurologic problems are common\ncomplaints. Intake o\ue03e certain toxins (eg, lead) can cause\nacquired porphyrias. Increased amounts o\ue03e porphyrins or their\nprecursors can be detected in blood and urine, \ue03eacilitating\ndiagnosis.\n\u25a0Catabolism o\ue03e the heme ring, initiated by the mitochondrial\nenzyme hem\ne oxygenase, produces the linear tetrapyrrole,\nbiliverdin. Subsequent reduction o\ue03e biliverdin in the cytosol\n\ue03eorms bilirubin.TABLE 31\u20134 Laboratory Results in Normal Patients and Patients With Three Different Causes of Jaundice\nCondition Serum Bilirubin Urine Urobilinogen Urine Bilirubin Fecal Urobilinogen\nNormal\nDirect: 0.1-0.4 mg/dL 0-4 mg/24 h Absent 40-280 mg/24 h\nIndirect: 0.2-0.7 mg/dL\nHemolytic anemia \u2191Indirect Increased Absent Increased\nHepatitis \u2191Direct and indirect Decreased i\ue039 micro-obstruction\nis presentPresent i\ue039 micro-obstruction\noccursDecreased\nObstructive jaundicea\u2191Direct Absent Present Trace to absent\naThe most common causes o\ue039 obstructive (posthepatic) jaundice are cancer o\ue039 the head o\ue039 the pancreas and a gallstone lodged in the common bile duct. The presence o\ue039 bili-\nrubin in the urine is sometimes re\ue039erred to as choluria\u2014there\ue039ore, hepatitis and obstruction o\ue039 the common bile duct cause choluric jaundice, whereas the jaundice o\ue039 hemolytic\nanemia is re\ue039erred to as acholuric. The laboratory results in patients with hepatitis are variable, depending on the extent o\ue039 damage to parenchymal cells and the extent o\ue039\nmicro-obstruction to bile ductules.

When linke\ue035 to\nvitamins or vitamin \ue035erivatives, nucleoti\ue035es \ue037orm a portion\no\ue037 many coenzymes. As the principal \ue035onors an\ue035 acceptors o\ue037\nphosphoryl groups in metabolism, nucleosi\ue035e tri- an\ue035 \ue035iphos-\nphates such as A\ue02fP an\ue035 ADP are the principal players in the\nenergy trans\ue035uctions that accompany metabolic interconver-\nsions an\ue035 oxi\ue035ative phosphorylation. Linke\ue035 to sugars or lip-\ni\ue035s, nucleosi\ue035es constitute key biosynthetic interme\ue035iates. \ue02fhe\nsugar \ue035erivatives UDP-glucose an\ue035 UDP-galactose participate\nin sugar interconversions an\ue035 in the biosynthesis o\ue037 starch an\ue035\nglycogen. Similarly, nucleosi\ue035e-lipi\ue035 \ue035erivatives such as CDP-\nacylglycerol are interme\ue035iates in lipi\ue035 biosynthesis. Roles that\nnucleoti\ue035es per\ue037orm in metabolic regulation inclu\ue035e A\ue02fP-\n\ue035epen\ue035ent phosphorylation o\ue037 key metabolic enzymes, allo-\nsteric regulation o\ue037 enzymes by A\ue02fP , ADP , AMP , an\ue035 C\ue02fP , an\ue035\ncontrol by ADP o\ue037 the rate o\ue037 oxi\ue035ative phosphorylation. \ue02fhe\ncyclic nucleoti\ue035es cAMP an\ue035 cGMP serve as the secon\ue035 mes-\nsengers in hormonally regulate\ue035 events, an\ue035 G\ue02fP an\ue035 GDP\nplay key roles in the casca\ue035e o\ue037 events that characterize signal\ntrans\ue035uction pathways. In a\ue035\ue035ition to the central roles that\nnucleoti\ue035es play in metabolism, their me\ue035ical applications\ninclu\ue035e the use o\ue037 synthetic purine an\ue035 pyrimi\ue035ine analogs\nthat contain halogens, thiols, or a\ue035\ue035itional nitrogen atoms in\nthe chemotherapy o\ue037 cancer an\ue035 AIDS, an\ue035 as suppressors o\ue037\nthe immune response \ue035uring organ transplantation.\nCHEMISTRY OF PURINES,\nPY\nRIMIDINES, NUCLEOSIDES,\n& NUCLEOTIDES\nPurines & Pyrimidines Are\nHeterocyclic \nCompounds\nPurines an\ue035 pyrimi\ue035ines are aromatic heteroc ycles , cyclic\nstructures that contain, in a\ue035\ue035ition to carbon, other (hetero)\natoms such as nitrogen. Note that the smaller pyrimi\ue035ine\nmolecule has the longer name an\ue035 the larger purine mol-\necule the shorter name, an\ue035 that their six-atom rings are\nnumbere\ue035 in opposite \ue035irections ( Figure 32\u20131 ). Purines orpyrimi\ue035ines with an NH2group are weak bases (p Kavalues\n3-4), although the pro\nton present at low pH is associate\ue035, not\nas one might expect with the exocyclic amino group, but with\na ring nitrogen, typically N1 o\ue037 a\ue035enine, N7 o\ue037 guanine, an\ue035 N3\no\ue037 cytosine. \ue02fhe planar character o\ue037 purines an\ue035 pyrimi\ue035ines\n\ue037acilitates their close association, or \u201cstacking, \u201d that stabilizes\n\ue035ouble-stran\ue035e\ue035 DNA (see Chapter 34). \ue02fhe oxo an\ue035 amino\ngroups o\ue037 purines an\ue035 pyrimi\ue035ines exhibit keto\u2013enol an\ue035\namine\u2013imine tautomerism (Figure 32\u20132 ), although physi-\nologic con\ue035itions strongly \ue037avor the amino an\ue035 oxo \ue037orms.\nNucleosides Are N-Glycosides\nNucleo sides are \ue035erivatives o\ue037 purines an\ue035 pyrimi\ue035ines that\nhave a sugar linke\ue035 to a ring nitrogen o\ue037 a purine or pyrimi-\n\ue035ine. Numerals with a prime (eg, 2 \u2032or 3\u2032) \ue035istinguish atoms\no\ue037 the sugar \ue037rom those o\ue037 the heterocycle. \ue02fhe sugar in ribo-\nnucleosides is d-ribose, an\ue035 in deoxyribonucleosides is\n2-\ue035eoxy-d-ribose. Both sugars are linke\ue035 to the heterocycle by\nana-N-glycosidic bond , almost always to the N-1 o\ue037 a pyrimi-\n\ue035ine or to N-9 o\ue037 a purine ( Figure 32\u20133 ).\nNucleotides Are Phosphorylated\nNucleosides\nMononucleo tides are nucleo sides with a phosphoryl group\nesteri\ue037ie\ue035 to a hy\ue035roxyl group o\ue037 the sugar. \ue02fhe 3 \u2032- an\ue035\n5\u2032-nucleoti\ue035es are nucleosi\ue035es with a phosphoryl group on the\n3\u2032- or 5 \u2032-hy\ue035roxyl group o\ue037 the sugar, respectively. Since most\nnucleoti\ue035es are 5 \u2032-, the pre\ue037ix \u201c5 \u2032-\u201d usually is omitte\ue035 when\nnaming them.

This polymeric molecule, deoxy-\nribonucleic acid (DNA) , is the chemical basis of heredity\nand is organized into genes, the fundamental units of genetic\ninformation. The basic information pathway\u2014that is, DNA,\nwhich directs the synthesis of RNA, which in turn both directs\nand regulates protein synthesis\u2014has been elucidated. Genes\ndo not function autonomously; rather their replication and\nfunction are controlled by various gene products, primarily\nproteins often in collaboration with components of various\nsignal transduction pathways. Knowledge of the structure and\nfunction of nucleic acids is essential in understanding genetics\nand many aspects of pathophysiology as well as the genetic\nbasis of disease.\nDNA CONTAINS THE GENETIC\nINFORMA\nTION\nThe demonstration that DNA contained the genetic infor-\nmation\n was first made in 1944 in a series of classic experi-\nments by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty. They showed that thegenetic determination of the character (type) of the capsule of\na specific pneumococcus bacterium could be transmitted to\nanother of a different capsular type by introducing purified\nDNA from the former pneumococcus into the latter. These\nauthors referred to the agent (later shown to be DNA) accom-\nplishing the change as \u201ctransforming factor. \u201d Subsequently,\nthis type of genetic manipulation has become commonplace.\nConceptually similar experiments are now regularly performed\nutilizing a variety of cells, including human cells and mamma-\nlian embryos as recipients and molecularly cloned DNA as the\ndonor of genetic information.\nDNA Contains Four Distinct\nDeoxynucleotides\nThe chemical nature of the monomeric deoxynucleotide\nunits of DN\nA\u2014deoxyadenylate ,deoxyguanylate ,deoxycyti-\ndylate , and thymidylate \u2014is described in Chapter 32.

Since the genetic information\nresides in the order of the monomeric units within the poly-\nmers, there must exist a mechanism of reproducing or repli-\ncating this specific information with a high degree of fidelity.\nThat requirement, together with x-ray diffraction data from\nthe DNA molecule generated by Franklin, and the observa-\ntion of Chargaff that in DNA molecules the concentration of\ndeoxyadenosine (A) nucleotides equals that of thymidine (T)\nnucleotides (A = T), while the concentration of deoxyguanosine\n(G) nucleotides equals that of deoxycytidine (C) nucleotides\n(G = C), led Watson, Crick, and Wilkins to propose in the early\n1950s a model of a double-stranded (ds) DNA molecule. The\nmodel they proposed is depicted in Figure 34\u20132 . The two\nstrands of this double-stranded helix are held in register by\nboth hydrogen bonds (H-bonds; see Figure 2\u20132) between\nthe purine and pyrimidine bases of the respective linear mol-\necules and by van der Waals andhydrophobic interactions\n(see Chapter 2 and Figure 2\u20134) between the stacked adjacent\nbase pairs. The pairings between the purine and pyrimidine\nnucleotides on the opposite strands are very specific, and are\ndependent on hydrogen bonding of A with T andG with C\n(see Figure 34\u20132). A\u2013T and G\u2013C base pairs are often referred\nto as Watson-Crick base pairs .This common form of DNA is said to be right handed\nbecause as one looks down the double helix, the base residues\nform a spiral in a clockwise direction. In the double-stranded\nmolecule, restrictions imposed by the rotation about the phos-\nphodiester bond, the favored anti-configuration of the glyco-\nsidic bond (see Figure 32\u20135), and the predominant tautomers\n(see Figure 32\u20132) of the four bases (A, G, T, and C) allow A to\npair only with T, and G only with C, as depicted in Figure 34\u20133 .\nThese base-pairing restrictions explain the earlier observa-\ntion that in a double-stranded DNA molecule the content of\nA equals that of T and the content of G equals that of C. The\ntwo strands of the double-helical molecule, each of which pos-\nsesses a polarity , are antiparallel ; that is, one strand runs in\nthe 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction and the other in the 3 \u2032to 5\u2032 direction.\nWithin a particular gene in the double-stranded DNA mole-\ncules, the genetic information resides in the sequence of nucle-\notides on one strand, the template strand . This is the strand\nof DNA that is copied, or transcribed, during ribonucleic acid\n(RNA) synthesis. It is sometimes referred to as the noncoding\nstrand . The opposite strand is considered the coding strand\nbecause it matches the sequence of the RNA transcript (but\ncontaining uracil in place of thymine; see Figure 34\u20138) that\nencodes the protein.FIGURE 34\u20131 A segment of one strand of a DNA molecule in which the purine and pyrimidine bases guanine (G), cytosine (C),\nthymine \n(T), and adenine (A) are held together by a phosphodiester backbone between 2 \u2032-deoxyribosyl moieties attached to the\nnucleobases by an N-glycosidic bond. Note that the phosphodiester backbone is negatively charged and has a polarity (ie, a direction).\nConvention dictates that a single-stranded DNA sequence is written in the 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction (ie, pGpCpTpAp, where G, C, T, and A represent the\nfour bases and P represents the interconnecting phosphates)."

In the test tube, double-stranded\nDNA can exist in at least six forms (A-DNA, through E-DNA\nand Z-DNA). These different forms of DNA differ with regard\nto intra- and interstrand interactions and involve structural\nrearrangements within the monomeric units of DNA. The B\nform is usually found under physiologic conditions. A sin-\ngle turn of B form DNA about the long axis of the molecule\ncontains 10 bp. The distance spanned by one turn of B-DNA\nis 3.4 nm (34 \u00c5). The width (helical diameter) of the double\nhelix in B-DNA is 2 nm (20 \u00c5).\nThere Are Grooves in the DNA Molecule\nExamination of the model depicted in Figure 34\u20132 reveals a ma jor\ngroove and a minor groove winding along the molecule parallel\nto the phosphodiester backbones. In these grooves, proteins often\ninteract specifically with exposed atoms of the nucleotides (via\nspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions), thereby recogniz-\ning and binding to specific nucleotide sequences as well as the\nunique shapes formed therefrom. Binding usually occurs without\ndisrupting the base pairing of the double-helical DNA molecule.\nAs discussed in Chapters 35, 36, and 38, regulatory proteins that\ncontrol DNA replication, repair, and recombination as well as the\ntranscription of specific genes occur through such protein-DNA\ninteractions, and thus contribute critically to cellular function.\nThe Denaturation of DNA Is Used to\nAnalyze \nIts Structure\nAs depicted in Figure 34\u20133, three H-bonds, formed by hydro-\ngen \natoms bonded to electronegative N or O atoms, hold the\ndeoxyguanosine nucleotide to the deoxycytidine nucleotide.\nBy contrast, the other canonical base pair, the A\u2013T pair, is held\ntogether by two H-bonds. Note that the four DNA nucleotide\nbases ([dG, dA] purines and [dT, dC] pyrimidines) are flat,\nplanar molecules (see Figure 32\u20131 and Table 32\u20131). These two\nkey properties of the nucleotide bases allow them to closely\nstack within duplex DNA (see Figure 34\u20132). Moreover, the\natoms within the aromatic, heterocyclic bases are highly polariz-\nable and, coupled with the fact that many of the atoms within the\nbases contain partial charges, allows for the stacked bases to form\nvan der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Collectively these\nforces are referred to as base-stacking forces or base-stacking\ninteractions. The base-stacking interactions between adjacent\nG\u2013C (or C\u2013G) base pairs are stronger than A\u2013T (or T\u2013A) base\npairs. Thus, overall, G\u2013C-rich DNA sequences are more resistant\nto denaturation, or strand separation, termed \u201cmelting, \u201d than are\nA\u2013T-rich regions of DNA.\nDNA Can be Reversibly Denatured &\nSpecifically \nRenatured, Both in the\nTest Tube & in Living Cells\nIn the laboratory the do uble-stranded structure of DNA can\nbe separated , ordenatured into its two component strandsS A  T S\nS S T  A\nP PP PP P\nS G C S\nS G  C SMinor groove\n34 A\n20 AMajor grooveo\no\nFIGURE 34\u20132 A diagrammatic representation of the Watson\nand \nCrick model of the double-helical structure of the B form of\nDNA.

Concomitant\nwith the denaturation of the DNA molecule into two single\nstrands is an increase in the optical absorbance in the ultravio-\nlet light spectrum (260 nm; see Chapter 32) of the purine and\npyrimidine bases of each strand; this phenomenon is referred\nto as hyperchromicity of denaturation. Because of the com-\nbined strength of base stacking andthe H-bonding between the\ncomplementary bases in each strand, the double-stranded DNA\nmolecule exhibits properties of a rigid rod. Thus, native double-\nstranded DNA in solution is an extremely viscous material.\nHowever, on denaturation, DNA solutions lose their viscosity.\nThe strands of a given molecule of double-stranded DNA\nseparate over a temperature range. The midpoint of the mea-\nsured DNA denaturation is called the melting temperature ,\norTm. The Tmis influenced by the base composition of the\nDNA and by the salt concentration or other components of\nthe solution (see following discussion). DNA rich in G\u2013C pairs\nmelts at a higher temperature than DNA rich in A\u2013T pairs,\ndue to differences in hydrogen bond content and base stack-\ning, as discussed earlier. A 10-fold increase of monovalent cat-\nion concentration significantly increases the Tmby  neutralizing\nthe intrinsic interchain repulsion between the highly negatively\ncharged phosphates of the phosphodiester backbone of each\nDNA strand. For example, an increase of NaCl concentra-\ntion from 0.01 to 0.1 M increases Tmby  16.6\u00b0C. By contrast,\nchaotropes such as urea (NH2CONH2; see Figure 28\u201316) and\nfo\nrmamide (CH3NO) can efficiently form H-bonds with the\nnu\ncleotide bases, which destabilizes H-bonding between bases.\nSuch solution conditions will lower the Tm. Chaotrope addition\nallo\nws the strands of DNA or complementary DNA\u2013RNA, and\nintramolecular RNA-RNA hybrids (see following discussion) to\nbe separated at much lower temperatures. Lower temperatures\nminimize phosphodiester bond breakage and chemical damage\nto nucleotides that can occur on extended incubation in solu-\ntion. In living cells, both DNA denaturation and renaturation\n(see following discussion) occurs naturally during the processes\nof DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair (see\nChapter 35), and DNA gene transcription (see Chapter 36). In\nall of these instances DNA strand separation and renaturation\nis mediated through the action of specific nucleic acid binding\nproteins and various enzymes, in combination with thermal\nand/or chemical energy supplied via ATP hydrolysis.\nRenaturation of DNA Requires Precise\nBase \nPair Matching\nImportantly, separated strands of DNA will renat ure, or reas-\nsociate when appropriate temperature and salt conditions are\nachieved. Reannealing is often referred to as renaturation orhybridization . The rate of strand reassociation depends on the\nconcentration of the complementary strands. At a given tem-\nperature and salt concentration, a particular nucleic acid strand\nwill associate tightly only with its complementary strand. Thus,\nrenaturation is highly specific . Indeed, researchers have shown\nthat renatured DNA hybrid molecules with but one base pair\nmismatch can readily be detected and quantified. Importantly,\nDNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and RNA-RNA hybrid molecules will\nalso form under appropriate conditions. For example, DNA\nwill form a perfect double-stranded hybrid molecule with a\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA ) sequence, or with a cognate,\ncomplementary RNA . When hybridization is combined with\nvarious sophisticated analytical techniques scientists can spe-\ncifically detect, identify, and even determine the sequence of\nvanishingly small amounts of nucleic acids (both DNA and\nRNA). An overview of much of the enabling technology of\nsuch nucleic acid analyses is described in Chapter 39.\nDNA Exists in Relaxed &\nSupercoiled \nForms\nIn some organisms such as bacteria, bacteriophages, many\nDN\nA-containing animal viruses, as well as organelles such as\nmitochondria (see Figure 35\u20138), the ends of the DNA molecules\nare joined to create a closed circle with no covalently free ends.\nThis of course does not destroy the polarity of the molecules, but\nit eliminates all free 3 \u2032and 5 \u2032hydroxyl and phosphoryl groups.\nClosed circles exist in relaxed or supercoiled forms. Supercoils\nare introduced when a closed circle is twisted around its own axis\nor when a linear piece of duplex DNA, whose ends are fixed, is\ntwisted. This energy-requiring process puts the molecule under\ntorsional stress, and the greater the number of supercoils, the\ngreater the stress or torsion (test this by twisting a rubber band).\nNegative supercoils are formed when the molecule is twisted\nin the direction opposite from the clockwise turns of the right-\nhanded double helix found in B-DNA. Such DNA is said to be\nunderwound. The energy required to achieve this state is, in a\nsense, stored in the supercoils. The transition to another form that\nrequires energy is thereby facilitated by the underwinding (see\nFigure 35\u201319). One such transition is strand separation, which is\na prerequisite for DNA replication and transcription. Supercoiled\nDNA is therefore a preferred form in biologic systems. Enzymes\nthat catalyze topologic changes of DNA are called topoisomer-\nases. Topoisomerases can relax or insert supercoils, using ATP as\nan energy source. Homologs of this enzyme exist in all organisms\nand are important targets for cancer chemotherapy. Supercoils\ncan also form within linear DNAs if particular segments of DNA\nare constrained by interacting tightly with nuclear proteins that\nestablish two boundary sites defining a topologic domain.\nDNA PROVIDES A TEMPLATE FOR\nREPLICA\nTION & TRANSCRIPTION\nThe genetic information stored in the nucleotide sequence of\nDN\nA serves two purposes. It is the source of information for\nthe synthesis of all protein molecules of the cell and organism,"

Although RNA contains the ribonucleotides of\nadenine, guanine, and cytosine, it does not possess thymine\nexcept in the rare case mentioned in the following discus-\nsion. Instead of thymine, RNA contains the ribonucleotide\nof uracil.\n3.RNA can exist as a single strand, whereas DNA exists as\na double-stranded helical molecule.

Many other very abundant cyto-\nplasmic RNA molecules (ribosomal RNAs [rRNAs]) have\nstructural roles wherein they contribute to the formation and\nfunction of ribosomes (the organellar machinery for pro-\ntein synthesis) or serve as adapter molecules (transfer RNAs\n[tRNAs]) for the translation of RNA information into specific\nsequences of polymerized amino acids.\nInterestingly, some RNA molecules have intrinsic catalytic\nactivity. The activity of these RNA enzymes, or ribozymes ,\noften involves the cleavage of a nucleic acid. Two ribo-\nzymes are the ribozymes involved in the RNA splicing, andpeptidyl transferase that catalyzes peptide bond formation on\nthe ribosome.\nIn all eukaryotic cells, there are small nuclear RNA\n(snRNA) species that are not directly involved in protein syn-\nthesis but play pivotal roles in RNA processing, particularly\nmRNA processing. These relatively small molecules vary in\nsize from 90 to about 300 nucleotides ( Table 34\u20131 ). The prop-\nerties of the several classes of cellular RNAs are detailed in the\nfollowing discussion.\nThe genetic material for some animal and plant viruses\nis RNA rather than DNA. Although some RNA viruses never\nhave their information transcribed into a DNA molecule\n(eg, Influenza and Coronaviruses like COVID-19), certain ani-\nmal RNA viruses\u2014specifically, the retroviruses (eg, the human\nimmunodeficiency, or HIV virus)\u2014are transcribed by viral\nRNA\u2013dependent DNA polymerase, the so-called reverse\ntranscriptase , to produce a double-stranded DNA copy of their\nRNA genome. In many cases, the resulting double-stranded\nDNA transcript is integrated into the host genome and sub-\nsequently serves as a template for gene expression and from\nwhich new viral RNA genomes and viral mRNAs can be tran-\nscribed and subsequently translated by the host cell machin-\nery into viral proteins. Genomic insertion of such integrating\n\u201cproviral\u201d DNA molecules can, depending on the site involved,\nbe mutagenic, inactivating a gene or disregulating its expres-\nsion (see Figure 35\u201311).FIGURE 34\u20138 The relationship between the sequences of an RNA transcript and its gene, in which the coding and template strands\nare \nshown with their polarities.

Each differs from the others by abun-\ndance, size, function, and general stability.\nMessenger RNA\nThis class is the most heterogeneous in abundance, size, and\nstability; \nfor example, in brewer\u2019s yeast, specific mRNAs are\npresent in 100s/cell to, on average, \u22640.1/mRNA/cell in a genet-\nically homogeneous population. As detailed in Chapters 36\nand 38, both specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional\nmechanisms contribute to this large dynamic range in mRNA\ncontent. In mammalian cells, specific mRNA abundance likely\nvaries over a 104-fold range. All members of this RNA class\nfunction \nas messengers conveying the information in a gene to\nthe protein-synthesizing machinery, where each mRNA serves\nas a template on which a specific sequence of amino acids is\npolymerized to form a specific protein molecule, in this case\nthe ultimate gene product ( Figure 34\u20139 ).\nEukaryotic mRNAs have unique chemical characteristics.\nThe 5 \u2032terminus of mRNA is \u201ccapped\u201d by a 7-methylguanosine\ntriphosphate that is linked to an adjacent 2 \u2032-O-methyl ribo-\nnucleoside at its 5 \u2032-hydroxyl through the three phosphates\n(Figure 34\u201310 ). mRNA molecules frequently contain internal\nN6-methyladenine and other 2\u2032 -O-ribose-methylated nucleo-\ntides. The cap is involved in the recognition of mRNA by the\ntranslation machinery, and also helps stabilize the mRNA by\npreventing the nucleolytic attack by 5 \u2032-exoribonucleases. The\nprotein-synthesizing machinery begins translating the mRNA\ninto proteins beginning downstream of the 5 \u2032or capped ter-\nminus. At the other end of almost all eukaryotic mRNA mole-\ncules, the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl terminus has an attached, nongenetically\nencoded polymer of adenylate residues 20 to 250 nucleotidesin length. The poly(A) \u201ctail\u201d at the 3 \u2032-end of mRNAs maintains\nthe intracellular stability of the specific mRNA by preventing\nthe attack of 3 \u2032-exoribonucleases and also facilitates translation\n(see Figure 37\u20137). Both the mRNA \u201ccap\u201d and \u201cpoly(A) tail\u201d are\nadded posttranscriptionally by nontemplate-directed enzymes\nto mRNA precursor molecules (pre-mRNA). mRNA represents\n2 to 5% of total eukaryotic cellular RNA.\nIn mammalian cells, including cells of humans, the mRNA\nmolecules present in the cytoplasm are not the RNA products\nimmediately synthesized from the DNA template but must\nbe formed by processing from the precursor, or pre-mRNA\nbefore entering the cytoplasm. Thus, in mammalian cell nuclei,\nthe immediate products of gene transcription (primary tran-\nscripts) are very heterogeneous and can be 10- to 50-fold longer\nthan mature mRNA molecules. As discussed in Chapter 36,\npre-mRNA molecules are processed to generate mRNA mol-\necules, which then enter the cytoplasm to serve as templates\nfor protein synthesis.\nTransfer RNA\ntRNA molecules vary in length from 74 to 95 nucleotides and,\nlik\ne many other RNAs, are also generated by nuclear processing\nof a precursor molecule (see Chapter 36). The tRNA molecules\nserve as adapters for the translation of the information in the\nsequence of nucleotides of the mRNA into specific amino acids.\nThere are at least 20 species of tRNA molecules in every cell,\nat least one (and often several) corresponding to each of the\n20 amino acids required for protein synthesis. Although each spe-\ncific tRNA differs from the others in its sequence of nucleotides,\nthe tRNA molecules as a class have many features in common.\nThe primary structure\u2014that is, the nucleotide sequence\u2014of\nall tRNA molecules allows extensive folding and intrastrand\ncomplementarity to generate a secondary structure that appears\nin two dimensions like a cloverleaf ( Figure 34\u201311 ).\nAll tRNA molecules contain four main double-stranded\narms or stems, connected by single-stranded loops named\nfor their respective nucleotide composition or function.\nThe amino acid acceptor arm terminates in the nucleotides\nCpCpAOH. As with the mRNA 5\u2032 -Cap an d 3\u2032Poly A tail, these\nthree nucleotides (CCA) are added posttranscriptionally,\nin this case by a specific nucleotidyl transferase enzyme. The\ntRNA-appropriate amino acid is attached, or \u201ccharged, \u201d onto\nthe posttranscriptionally added 3 \u2032-OH group of the A moiety\nof the acceptor arm through the action of specific aminoacyl\ntRNA synthetases (see Figure 37\u20131). The D,T\u03c8C , and extra\narms help define a specific tRNA. tRNAs compose roughly\n20% of total cellular RNA. Recent work has shown that many\ntRNAs are specifically cleaved by certain ribonucleases to gen-\nerate unique subfragments termed tRNA-derived small RNA\n(tsRNAs ). These relatively stable tsRNAs are thought to regu-\nlate both transcription and translation (see Chapters 36\u201338).\nRibosomal RNA\nA ribosome is a cytoplasmic nucleoprotein structure that acts\nas \nthe machinery for the synthesis of proteins from the mRNAFIGURE 34\u20139 The expression of genetic information within\nDNA \ninto the form of an mRNA transcript with 5 \u2032to 3\u2032polarity\nand then into protein with N- to C-polarity is shown. DNA is tran-\nscribed into mRNA that is subsequently translated by ribosomes into\na specific protein molecule that exhibits polarity, N-terminus ( N) to\nC-terminus (C )."

Regulatory ncRNAs\nhave been described in most eukaryotes (see Chapter 38).\nThe small ncRNAs termed miRNAs and siRNAs typi-\ncally inhibit gene expression at the level of specific protein\nproduction by targeting mRNAs through one of several distinctmechanisms. miRNAs are generated by specific nucleolytic\nprocessing of the products of distinct genes/transcription units\n(see Figure 36\u201317). miRNA precursors, which are 5 \u2032-capped\nand 3 \u2032-polyadenylated, usually range in size from about 500 to\n1000 nucleotides.\nBy contrast, siRNAs are generated by the specific nucleo-\nlytic processing of large dsRNAs that are either produced from\nother endogenous RNAs, or dsRNAs introduced into the cell\nby, for example, RNA viruses. Both siRNAs and miRNAs\nhybridize via the formation of RNA\u2013RNA hybridization\nto their targeted mRNAs (see Figure 38\u201319). To date, hun-\ndreds of distinct miRNAs and siRNAs have been described\nin humans; estimates suggest that there are likely 1000s of\nhuman miRNA-encoding genes. Given their exquisite genetic\nspecificity, both miRNAs and siRNAs represent exciting new\npotential agents for therapeutic drug development . In the\nlaboratory siRNAs are frequently used to decrease or \u201cknock-\ndown\u201d specific protein levels (via siRNA homology\u2013directed\nmRNA degradation), and thus serve as an extremely useful\nand powerful alternative to gene-knockout technology (see\nChapter 39). Indeed, several siRNA-based therapeutic clinical\ntrials are in progress to test the efficacy of these novel mol-\necules as drugs for treating human disease.\nOther exciting recent observations in the RNA realm are\nthe identification and characterization of two classes of larger\nnoncoding RNAs, the circular RNAs (circRNAs) and the long\nnoncoding RNAs , orlncRNAs . Many circRNAs have recently\nbeen discovered and characterized. circRNAs appear to be pro-\nduced by RNA splicing-type reactions from a wide range of pre-\ncursor RNAs, both mRNA precursors and nonprotein coding\nlncRNA precursors (see following discussion for more infor-\nmation on lncRNAs). Though not an abundant class of RNA\nmolecules in most cells, circRNAs have been detected in all\neukaryotes tested, and seem particularly abundant in metazo-\nans. While the functions of circRNAs are still being elucidated\nthey seem to be particularly abundant in cells of the nervous sys-\ntem. Similar to lncRNAs, these molecules likely play important\nroles in cellular biology by regulating gene expression at mul-\ntiple levels. LncRNAs, which as their name implies, do not code\nfor protein, and range in size from ~300 to 1000s of nucleotides\nin length. These RNAs are typically transcribed from the large\nregions of eukaryotic genomes that do not encode for protein\n(ie, the mRNA encoding genes).

Bacterial sRNAs range in\nsize from 50 to 500 nucleotides, and like eukaryotic mi/si/\nlncRNAs, control the expression/activity of a large array of\ndistinct genes. sRNAs often repress, but sometimes activate\nprotein synthesis by binding to specific mRNA.\nSPECIFIC NUCLEASES DIGEST\nNUCLEIC \nACIDS\nEnzymes capable of degrading nucleic acids have been recog-\nnized f\nor many years. These nucleases can be classified in sev-\neral ways. Those that exhibit specificity for DNA are referred\nto as deoxyribonucleases . Those nucleases that specifically\nhydrolyze RNA are ribonucleases . Some nucleases degrade\nDNA and RNA. Within both of these classes are enzymes\ncapable of cleaving internal phosphodiester bonds to produce\neither 3 \u2032-hydroxyl and 5 \u2032-phosphoryl terminals or, 5 \u2032-hydroxyl\nand 3 \u2032-phosphoryl terminals. These are referred to as endo-\nnucleases . Some are capable of hydrolyzing both strands of\nadouble-stranded molecule, whereas others can only cleave\nsingle strands of nucleic acids. Some nucleases can hydro-\nlyze only unpaired single strands, while others are capable of\nhydrolyzing single strands participating in the formation of a\ndouble-stranded molecule. There exist classes of endonucle-\nases that recognize specific sequences in DNA. One class of\nthese DNA cleaving enzymes, the restriction endonucleases ,\nalso termed restriction enzymes, do so directly by binding\nspecific (usually) contiguous DNA base pairs (typically 4, 5,\n6, or 8 bp), and cleaving both strands of DNA, usually DNA\nwithin the binding/recognition sequence element. The second\nclass of enzymes, which are ribonucleoprotein complexes, uti-\nlizes a \u201cguide RNA \u201d of specific nucleotide sequence that targets\na nuclease to cleave distinct DNA or RNA sequences. These\nare the CRISPR-Cas family of enzymes. Both classes of DNA-\ncleaving enzyme are described in greater detail in Chapter 39.\nSome nucleases are capable of hydrolyzing a nucleotide\nonly when it is present at a terminal of a molecule; these are\nreferred to as exonucleases . Exonucleases act in one direction\n(3\u2032\u2192 5\u2032or 5\u2032\u2192 3\u2032) only. In bacteria, a 3 \u2032\u2192 5\u2032exonuclease is\nan integral part of the DNA replication machinery and there\nserves to edit\u2014or proofread\u2014the most recently added deoxy-\nnucleotide for base-pairing errors.In addition to their roles in nucleic acid metabolism in liv-\ning cells, the nucleases described here, in concert with a pano-\nply of other nucleic acid synthesizing and modifying enzymes,\ncoupled with nucleic acid cloning and sequencing techniques\nrepresent the essential tools of modern molecular genetics and\nmolecular medicine (see Chapter 39).\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0DNA consists of four bases\u2014A, G, C, and T\u2014that are held in\nlinear a\nrray by phosphodiester bonds through the 3 \u2032and 5 \u2032\npositions of adjacent deoxyribose moieties.\n\u25a0DNA is organized into two strands by the pairing of bases A to\nT a\nnd G to C on complementary strands. These strands form a\ndouble helix around a central axis.\n\u25a0The ~3 \u00d7 109bp of DNA in humans are organized into the\nhaploid complement of 23 chromosomes. The exact sequence\nof these 3 billion nucleotides defines the uniqueness of each\nindividual.\n\u25a0DNA provides a template, both for its own replication and thus\nmain\ntenance of the genotype, and for the transcription of the\nroughly 25,000 protein coding human genes as well as a large\narray of nonprotein coding regulatory ncRNAs.\n\u25a0RNA exists in several different cellular nucleoprotein\nstructures, m\nost of which are directly or indirectly involved\nin protein synthesis or its regulation. The linear array of\nnucleotides in RNA consists of A, G, C, and U, and the sugar\nmoiety is ribose.\n\u25a0The major forms of RNA include mRNA, rRNA, tRNA,\nsnRN\nAs and regulatory ncRNAs.

These processes provide a means of\nensuring adaptability and diversity for the organism, but\nwhen they go awry, can also result in disease. A number of\nenzyme systems are involved in DNA replication, alteration,\nand repair. Mutations are due to a change in the base sequence\nof DNA and may result from the faulty replication, transposi-\ntion, or repair of DNA and occur with a frequency of about\none in every 106cell divisions. Abnormalities in gene products\n(either in RNA, protein function, or amount) can be the result\nof mutations that occur in transcribed protein coding, and\nnonprotein coding DNA, or nontranscribed regulatory-region\nDNA. A mutation in a germ cell is transmitted to offspring\n(so-called vertical transmission of hereditary disease). A num-\nber of factors, including viruses, chemicals, ultraviolet light,\nand ionizing radiation can all increase the rate of mutation.O B J E C T I V E S\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou \nshould be able to:\u25a0Appreciate that the roughly 3 \u00d7 109base pairs of DNA that compose the\nhaploid genome of humans are divided uniquely between 23 linear DNA\nunits, the chromosomes. Humans, being diploid, have 23 pairs of these linear\nchromosomes: 22 autosomes and two sex chromosomes.\n\u25a0Understand that human genomic DNA, if extended end-to-end, would be\nmeters \nin length, yet still fits within the nucleus of the cell, an organelle that is\nonly microns (\u03bc; 10\u22126meters) in diameter. Such condensation in DNA length,\nin part, is induced following its association with the highly positively charged\nhistone proteins resulting in the formation of a unique DNA-histone complex\ntermed the nucleosome. Nucleosomes have DNA wrapped around the surface\nof an octamer of histones.\n\u25a0Explain that strings of nucleosomes form along the linear sequence of genomic\nDNA \nto form chromatin, which itself can be more tightly packaged and\ncondensed, this ultimately leads to the formation of the chromosomes.\n\u25a0Appreciate that while the chromosomes are the macroscopic functional units\nfo\nr DNA transcription, replication, recombination, gene assortment, and\ncellular division, it is DNA function at the level of the individual nucleotides that\ncomposes regulatory sequences linked to specific genes that are essential for life.\n\u25a0Describe the steps, phase of the cell cycle, and the molecules responsible for\nthe \nreplication, repair, and recombination of DNA, and understand the negative\neffects that errors in any of these processes can have on cellular, and thus,\norganismal integrity and health.35DNA Organization,\nRe\nplication, & Repair\nP .

It is becoming apparent that a number of\ndiseases\u2014and perhaps most cancers\u2014are due to the com-\nbined effects of vertical transmission of mutations as well as\nhorizontal transmission of induced mutations and the impact\nthereof on cellular function.\nCHROMATIN IS THE\nCHROMOSOMAL \nMATERIAL\nIN THE NUCLEI OF CELLS OF\nEUKARYOTIC ORGANISMS\nChromatin consists of very long double-stranded DNA\n(dsDNA) molecules and a nearly equal mass of small basic\nproteins termed histones as well as a smaller amount of non-\nhistone proteins (most of which are acidic and larger than\nhistones) and a small quantity of RNA. The nonhistone pro-\nteins include enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair,\nand the proteins involved in RNA synthesis, processing, and\ntransport to the cytoplasm as well as an array of proteins that\nregulate these various processes. The dsDNA helix in each\nchromosome has a length that is thousands of times the diam-\neter of the cell nucleus. One purpose of the molecules that\ncomprise chromatin, particularly the histones, is to condense\nthe DNA; however, it is important to note that the histones\nalso integrally participate in gene regulation (see Chapters 36,\n38, and 42); indeed, histones contribute importantly to all\nDNA-directed molecular transactions. Electron microscopic\nstudies of chromatin have demonstrated dense spherical par-\nticles called nucleosomes , which are approximately 10 nm in\ndiameter and connected by DNA filaments ( Figure 35\u20131 ).\nNucleosomes are composed of DNA wound around an octa-\nmeric complex of histone molecules. Biochemical, biophysi-\ncal, and X-ray crystallography data all corroborate this model\nof nucleosome structure.\nHistones Are the Most Abundant\nChromatin \nProteins\nHistones are a small family of closely related basic proteins.\nH1 \nhistones are the ones least tightly bound to chromatin\n(Figures 35\u20131 ,35\u20132 , and 35\u20133 ) and are, therefore, easily\nremoved with a salt solution, after which chromatin becomes\nmore soluble. The organizational unit of this soluble chro-\nmatin is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes contain four major\ntypes of histones: H2A ,H2B, H3, and H4. The sequence\nand structures of all four histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4,\nthe so-called core histones that form the nucleosome, have\nbeen highly conserved between species, although variants of\nthese four histones exist in various organisms, and are used for\nspecialized purposes. The extreme conservation of core his-\ntone sequences implies that the overall functions of histones\nare identical in all eukaryotes, and that the entire moleculeis involved quite specifically in carrying out these functions.\nThe carboxyl terminal two-thirds of the histone molecules are\nhydrophobic, while their amino terminal thirds are particu-\nlarly rich in basic amino acids. These four core histones are\nsubject to at least six major, or frequent, types of covalent\nmodification or posttranslational modifications (PTMs) :\nacetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation,\nmonoubiquitylation, and sumoylation. These histone modifi-\ncations play important roles in chromatin structure and func-\ntion, as illustrated in Table 35\u20131 . Chapters 38 and 42 provide\na more detailed discussion of the role of histone PTMs in cel-\nlular biology.FIGURE 35\u20131 Electron micrograph of chromatin showing\nindividual \nnucleosomes (white, ball-shaped) attached to strands\nof DNA (thin, gray line); see also Figure 35\u20132.

Under\nphysiologic conditions, these histone oligomers associate to form\nthehistone octamer of the composition (H3\u2013H4)2\u2013(H2A\u2013H2B)2.\nThe Nucleosome Contains\nHistone \n& DNA\nWhen the histone octamer is mixed with purified dsDNA\nunder \nappropriate ionic conditions, the same x-ray diffraction\npattern is formed as that observed in freshly isolated chroma-\ntin. Biochemical and electron microscopic studies confirm\nthe existence of reconstituted nucleosomes in such in vitro-\ngenerated preparations. Furthermore, the reconstitution of\nnucleosomes from DNA and histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4\nis independent of the organismal or cellular origin of the vari-\nous components. A result argues that nucleosome formation is\nan ancient and evolutionarily conserved, fundamental cellular\nprocess. Moreover, neither the histone H1, nor the nonhistone\nproteins are necessary for the reconstitution of the nucleo-\nsome core.\nIn the nucleosome, the DNA is supercoiled in a left-handed\nhelix over the surface of the disk-shaped histone octamer (see\nFigure 35\u20132). The majority of core histone proteins interact\nwith the DNA on the inside of the supercoil without protrud-\ning, although the amino terminal tails of all the histones are\nthought to extend outside of this structure and are available\nfor regulatory PTMs (see Table 35\u20131).\nThe (H3\u2013H4)2tetramer itself can confer nuc leosome-like\nproperties on DNA and thus has a central role in the forma-\ntion of the nucleosome. The addition of two H2A\u2013H2B dimersstabilizes the primary particle and firmly binds two addi-\ntional half-turns of DNA previously bound only loosely to the\n(H3\u2013H4)2. Thus, 1.75 superhelical turns of DNA are wrapped\narou\nnd the surface of the histone octamer, protecting 145 to\n150 bp of DNA and forming the nucleosome core particle\n(see Figure 35\u20132). In chromatin, core particles are separated\nby a roughly 30-bp region of DNA termed \u201clinker .\u201dMost\nof the DNA is in a repeating series of these structures, giving\nchromatin a repeating \u201cbeads-on-a-string\u201d appearance when\nexamined by electron microscopy (see Figure 35\u20131).\nIn vivo the assembly of nucleosomes is mediated by one of\nseveral nuclear chromatin assembly factors whose functions\nare facilitated by histone chaperones, a group of proteins that\nexhibit high affinity for binding histones. As the nucleosome is\nassembled, histones are released from the histone chaperones.\nNucleosomes appear to exhibit preference for certain regions\non specific DNA molecules, but the basis for this nonrandom\ndistribution, termed phasing , is not yet completely understood.\nPhasing is likely related both to the relative physical flexibility of\nparticular nucleotide sequences to accommodate the regions\nof kinking within the nucleosomal supercoil, as well as the\npresence of other DNA-bound factors that limit the sites of\nnucleosome deposition.\nHIGHER-ORDER STRUCTURES\nPROVIDE \nFOR THE COMPACTION\nOF CHROMATIN\nElectron microscopy of chromatin reveals two higher orders of\nstructure\u2014the 10-nm fibril and the 30-nm chr\nomatin fiber\u2014\nbeyond that of the nucleosome itself. The disk-like nucleo-\nsome structure has a 10-nm diameter and a height of 5 nm.\nThe10-nm fibril consists of nucleosomes arranged with their\nedges separated by a small distance (30 bp of linker DNA) with\ntheir flat faces parallel to the fibril axis (see Figure 35\u20133). The\n10-nm fibril is probably further supercoiled with six or seven\nnucleosomes per turn to form the 30-nm chromatin fiber\n(see Figure 35\u20133). Each turn of the supercoil is relatively flat,\nand the faces of the nucleosomes of successive turns would be\nnearly parallel to each other. H1 histones appear to stabilize the\n30-nm fiber, but their position and that of the variable length\nlinker DNA are not clear. It is probable that nucleosomes can\nform a variety of packed structures. In order to form a mitotic\nchromosome, the 30-nm fiber must be compacted in length\nanother 100-fold (see following discussion).\nIninterphase chromosomes , chromatin fibers appear\nto be organized into 30,000 to 100,000 bp loops or domains\nanchored in a scaffolding , or supporting matrix structure\nwithin the nucleus, the so-called nuclear matrix . Within these\ndomains, referred to as Topologically Associated Domains,\nor TADs ; see Figure 35\u20133, some DNA sequences are located\nnonrandomly. It has been suggested that at least some of the\nlooped domains of chromatin correspond to one or more\nseparate genetic functions, containing both coding and non-\ncoding regions of the cognate gene or genes.

DNase I makes single-strand cuts in\nnearly any segment of DNA due to its low-sequence specificity.\nHowever, DNase I will only avidly digest DNA that is not pro-\ntected, or bound by protein. The sensitivity to DNase I of active\nchromatin regions reflects only a potential for transcription rather\nthan transcription itself, and in several different cellular systems\ncan be correlated with a relative lack of 5-methyldeoxycytidine\n(meC; see Figure 32\u20137) in the DNA, and particular histone\nvariants and/or histone PTMs (phosphorylation, acetylation,\netc.; see Table 35\u20131).\nWithin the large regions of active chromatin there exist\nshorter stretches of 100 to 300 nucleotides that exhibit an even\ngreater (another 10-fold) sensitivity to DNase I. These hyper-\nsensitive sites probably result from a structural conformation\nthat favors access of the nuclease to the DNA. These regions are\noften located immediately upstream from the active gene and\nare the location of interrupted nucleosomal structure caused\nby the binding of nonhistone regulatory transcription factor\nproteins (enhancer-binding transcriptional activator proteins;\nsee Chapters 36 and 38). In many cases, it seems that if a gene\nis capable of being transcribed, it very often has a DNase-\nhypersensitive site(s) in the chromatin immediately upstream.\nAs noted earlier, nonhistone regulatory proteins involved in\ntranscription control and those involved in maintaining access\nto the template strand lead to the formation of hypersensitive\nsites. Such sites often provide the first clue about the presence\nand location of a transcription control element.\nBy contrast, transcriptionally inactive chromatin is densely\npacked during interphase as observed by electron microscopic\nstudies and is referred to as heterochromatin ; transcription-\nally active chromatin stains less densely and is referred to aseuchromatin . Generally, euchromatin is replicated earlier\nthan heterochromatin in the mammalian cell cycle (see fol-\nlowing discussion). The chromatin in these regions of inactiv-\nity is often high in meC content, and histones therein contain\nrelatively lower levels of certain \u201cactivating\u201d covalent modifi-\ncations and higher levels of \u201crepressing\u201d histone PTMs (see\nTable 35\u20131).\nThere are two types of heterochromatin: constitutive and\nfacultative. Constitutive heterochromatin is always relatively\nhighly condensed (ie, heterochromatic), and thus essentially\nalways inactive. Such constitutive heterochromatin is found in\nthe regions near the chromosomal centromere and at chro-\nmosomal ends (telomeres). Facultative heterochromatin\nis at times condensed, but at other times it is actively tran-\nscribed and, thus, uncondensed and appears as euchromatin.\nOf the two members of the X-chromosome pair in mamma-\nlian females, one X chromosome is almost completely inac-\ntive transcriptionally and is heterochromatic. However, the\nheterochromatic X chromosome decondenses during game-\ntogenesis and becomes transcriptionally active during early\nembryogenesis\u2014thus, it is facultative heterochromatin.\nCertain cells of insects, for example, Chironomus and\nDrosophila , contain giant chromosomes that have been rep-\nlicated for multiple cycles without separation of daughter\nchromatids. These copies of DNA line up side by side in pre-\ncise register and produce a banded chromosome containing\nregions of condensed chromatin and lighter bands of more\nextended chromatin. Transcriptionally active regions of these\npolytene chromosomes are especially decondensed into\n\u201cpuffs \u201d that can be shown to contain the enzymes respon-\nsible for transcription and to be the sites of RNA synthesis\n(Figure 35\u20134 ). Using highly sensitive fluorescently labeled\nhybridization probes, specific gene sequences can be mapped,\nor \u201cpainted, \u201d within the nuclei of human cells, even without\npolytene chromosome formation, using fluorescence in situ\nhybridization, or FISH techniques (see Chapter 39).\nDNA IS ORGANIZED INTO\nCHROMOSOMES\nIn preparation for cell duplication via the cyclical process termed\nmi\ntosis, cellular DNA content is doubled (see Figure 35\u201320).\nDuring one phase of the mitotic cycle termed metaphase, the\nduplicated chromosomes condense and can readily be visualized.\nCondensed chromosomes possess a twofold symmetry, with the\nidentical duplicated sister chromatids connected at a chromo-\nsomal structure termed the centromere , the relative position of\nwhich is characteristic for a given chromosome ( Figure 35\u20135 ).\nThe centromere is an adenine\u2013thymine (A\u2013T)-rich region con-\ntaining repeated DNA sequences that range in size from 102\n(b\nrewers\u2019 yeast) to 106(m ammals) base pairs (bp). Metazoan\ncentromeres are bound by nucleosomes containing the special\nhistone H3 variant protein CENP-A and other specific centro-\nmere-binding proteins. This complex, called the kinetochore ,\nprovides the anchor for the mitotic spindle, on which chromo-\nsomal segregation occurs during mitosis."

Since\ntelomere shortening has been associated with both malignant\ntransformation (see Chapter 56) and aging (see Chapter 58), this\nenzyme has become an attractive target for cancer chemo-\ntherapy and drug development (see Chapter 56). Each sister\nchromatid contains one dsDNA molecule. As schematized in\nFigure 35\u20133, during interphase, the packing of the DNA mol-\necule is less dense than it is in the condensed chromosome\nduring metaphase.

Thus,\nthe packaging of the nucleoproteins in chromosomes of higher\neukaryotes must in some way be dependent on species-specific\ncharacteristics of the DNA molecules.\nA combination of specialized staining techniques and\nhigh-resolution microscopy has allowed cytogeneticists to\nquite precisely map many genes to specific regions of mouse\nand human chromosomes. With the recent elucidation of the\nhuman and mouse genome sequences (among others), it has\nbecome clear that many of these visual mapping methods were\nremarkably accurate.\nCoding Regions Are Often Interrupted\nby \nIntervening Sequences\nThe protein coding regions of DNA, the transcripts of which\nulti\nmately appear in the cytoplasm as single mRNA molecules,\nare usually interrupted in the eukaryotic genome by large inter-\nvening sequences of nonprotein-coding DNA. Accordingly, the\nprimary transcripts ormRNA precursors (originally termed\nhnRNA because this species of RNA was quite heterogeneous\nin size [length] and mostly restricted to the nucleus), contain\nnonprotein coding intervening sequences of RNA that must be\nremoved in a process that also joins together the appropriate\nprotein-coding segments to form the mature mRNA. Most cod-\ning sequences for a single mRNA are interrupted in the genome(and thus in the primary transcript) by at least one\u2014and in\nsome cases as many as 50\u2014noncoding intervening sequences\ntermed introns . In most cases, the introns are much longer than\nthe coding regions termed exons . The processing of the primary\ntranscript, which involves precise removal of introns and splic-\ning of adjacent exons, is described in Chapter 36.\nThe function of the intervening sequences, or introns, is\nnot totally clear. However, mRNA precursor molecules can\nbe differentially spliced thereby increasing the number of dis-\ntinct (yet related) proteins produced by a single gene and its\ncorresponding primary mRNA gene transcript. Introns may\nalso serve to separate functional domains (exons) of coding\ninformation in a form that permits genetic rearrangement\nby recombination to occur more rapidly than if all coding\nregions for a given genetic function were contiguous. Such an\nenhanced rate of genetic rearrangement of functional domains\nmight allow more rapid evolution of biologic function. In some\ninstances, other protein-coding or noncoding RNAs are local-\nized within the intronic DNA of certain genes (see Chapter 34).\nThe relationships among chromosomal DNA, gene clusters on\nthe chromosome, the exon\u2013intron structure of genes, and the\nfinal mRNA product are illustrated in Figure 35\u20137 .\nTHE EXACT FUNCTION OF MUCH\nOF \nTHE MAMMALIAN GENOME IS\nNOT WELL UNDERSTOOD\nThe haploid genome of each human cell consists of 3.3 \u00d7 109\nbp \nof DNA subdivided into 23 chromosomes.

However, early studies of mutation\nrates a\nnd of the complexities of the genomes of higher organ-\nisms suggested that humans have significantly fewer than\n100,000 proteins encoded by the ~1% of the human genome\nthat is composed of exonic DNA. Indeed, current estimates\nbased on sequencing of the human genome and the collection\nof mRNA species produced therefrom suggest there are about\n25,000 protein-coding genes in humans. This implies that most\ngenomic DNA is nonprotein coding\u2014that is, its information\nis never translated into an amino acid sequence of a protein\nmolecule. Certainly, some of the excess DNA sequences serve\nto regulate the expression of genes during development, differ-\nentiation, and adaptation to the environment, either by serving\nas binding sites for regulatory proteins or by encoding regula-\ntory ncRNAs. Some excess clearly makes up the intervening\nsequences or introns that split the coding regions of genes, and\nanother portion of the excess appears to be composed of many\nfamilies of repeated sequences for which clear functions have\nyet to be defined, though some small RNAs transcribed from\nthese repeats can modulate transcription, either directly by\ninteracting with the transcription machinery or indirectly by\naffecting the activity of the chromatin template.

Further research will elucidate the\nrole(s) played by such transcripts.\nThe DNA in an eukaryotic genome can be divided into two\nbroad \u201csequence classes. \u201d These are unique-sequence DNA, or\nnonrepetitive DNA and repetitive-sequence DNA. In the hap-\nloid genome, unique-sequence DNA generally includes thesingle copy genes that code for proteins. The repetitive DNA\nin the haploid genome includes sequences that vary in copy\nnumber from 2 to as many as 107copies per cell.\nMore Than Half the DNA in\nEukaryotic \nOrganisms Is in Unique or\nNonrepetitive Sequences\nThis estimation and genome-wide organization of repetitive\nsequence \nDNA was based on a variety of techniques, and most\nrecently on direct genomic DNA sequencing. Similar techniques\nwere used to determine the number of protein-encoding genes.\nIn brewers\u2019 yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a lower eukaryote),\nabout two-thirds of its 6200 genes are expressed, but only\napproximately one-fifth are required for viability under labo-\nratory growth conditions. In typical tissues in a higher eukaryote\n(eg, mammalian liver and kidney), between 10,000 and\n15,000 genes are actively expressed. Different combinations\nof genes are expressed in each tissue of course, and how this\nis accomplished is one of the major unanswered questions in\nbiology.\nIn Human DNA, at Least 30% of\nthe \nGenome Consists of Repetitive\nSequences\nRepetitive-sequence DNA can be broadly classified as mod-\neratel\ny repetitive or as highly repetitive. The highly repeti-\ntive sequences consist of 5 to 500 base pair lengths repeated\nmany times in tandem. These sequences are often clustered in\ncentromeres and telomeres of the chromosome and some are\npresent in about 1 to 10 million copies per haploid genome."

In many cases, these long interspersed repeats are\ntranscribed by RNA polymerase II and the produced RNAs\ncontain 5\u2032 -Cap structures (see Figure 34\u201310) indistinguish-\nable from those on mRNA. Depending on their length, mod-\nerately repetitive sequences are classified as long interspersed\nnuclear elements (LINEs) orshort interspersed nuclear\nelements (SINEs) . Both types appear to be retroposons ; that\nis, they arose from movement from one location to another\n(transposition) through an RNA intermediate by the action\nof reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template into\nDNA. Mammalian genomes contain 20,000 to 50,000 copies of\nthe 6 to 7 kbp LINEs. These represent species-specific families\nof repeat elements. SINEs are shorter (70-300 bp), and there\nmay be more than 100,000 copies per genome. Of the SINEs\nin the human genome, one family, the Alu family , is present\nin about 500,000 copies per haploid genome and accounts for\n~10% of the human genome. Members of the human Alu fam-\nily and their closely related analogs in other animals can be\ntranscribed as integral components of mRNA precursors or as\ndiscrete RNA molecules, including the well-studied 4.5S RNA\nand 7S RNA. These particular family members are highly con-\nserved within a species as well as between mammalian species.\nComponents of the short-interspersed repeats, including the\nmembers of the Alu family, may be mobile elements, capable\nof jumping into and out of various sites within the genome\n(see following discussion). These transposition events can\nhave disastrous results, as exemplified by the insertion of\nAlu sequences into a gene, which, when so mutated, causes\nneurofibromatosis. Additionally, Alu B1 and B2 SINE RNAs\nhave been shown to regulate mRNA production at the levels of\ntranscription and mRNA splicing.\nMicrosatellite Repeat Sequences\nOne category of repeat sequences exists as both dispersed and\ngrouped \ntandem arrays. The sequences consist of 2 to 6 bp\nrepeated up to 50 times. These microsatellite sequences most\ncommonly are found as dinucleotide repeats of AC on one\nstrand and TG on the opposite strand, but several other forms\noccur, including CG, AT, and CA. The AC repeat sequences\noccur at 50,000 to 100,000 locations in the genome. At any\nlocus, the number of these repeats may vary on the two chro-\nmosomes, thus providing heterozygosity of the number of\ncopies of a particular microsatellite number in an individual.\nThis is a heritable trait, and because of their number and the\nease of detecting them using the polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) (see Chapter 39), such repeats are useful in construct-\ning genetic linkage maps. Most genes are associated with one\nor more microsatellite markers, so the relative position of\ngenes on chromosomes can be assessed, as can the associationof a gene with a disease. Using PCR, a large number of family\nmembers can be rapidly screened for a certain microsatellite\npolymorphism . The association of a specific polymorphism\nwith a gene in affected family members\u2014and the lack of this\nassociation in unaffected members\u2014may be the first clue\nabout the genetic basis of a disease.\nTrinucleotide sequences that increase in number (micro-\nsatellite instability) can cause disease. The unstable (CGG)n\nrepeat \nsequence (n = the number of repeats; in this case CGG)\nis associated with the fragile X syndrome. Other trinucleotide\nrepeats that undergo dynamic mutation (usually an increase\nin repeat numbers) are associated with Huntington chorea\n(CAG), myotonic dystrophy (CTG), spinobulbar muscular\natrophy (CAG), and Kennedy disease (CAG). The advent of\nnext-generation, high-throughput DNA sequencing tech-\nnologies (see Chapter 39) has dramatically impacted both the\nspeed, accuracy, and precision with which scientists and clini-\ncians can analyze human genome structure. Some newly insti-\ntuted clinical tests involve targeted genomic DNA sequencing\nprepared either from tissues or serum samples.\nONE PERCENT OF CELLULAR DNA\nIS \nIN MITOCHONDRIA\nThe majority of the polypeptides in mitochondria (about 54 out\nof \n67) are encoded by nuclear genes, while the rest are coded by\ngenes found in mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Human mitochondria\ncontain 2 to 10 copies of a small circular ~16 kbp dsDNA mol-\necule that makes up approximately 1% of total cellular DNA.\nThis mtDNA codes for mt-specific ribosomal and transfer\nRNAs and for 13 proteins that play key roles in the respira-\ntory chain (see Chapter 13). The linearized structural map of\nthe human mitochondrial genes is shown in Figure 35\u20138 . Some\nof the features of mtDNA are shown in Table 35\u20133 .\nAn important feature of human mitochondrial mtDNA\nis that\u2014because all mitochondria are contributed by the\novum during zygote formation\u2014it is transmitted by maternal\nnonmendelian inheritance. Thus, in diseases resulting from\nmutations of mtDNA, an affected mother would in theory\npass the disease to all of her children but only her daughters\nwould transmit the trait. However, in some cases, deletions in\nmtDNA occur during oogenesis and thus are not inherited\nfrom the mother. A number of diseases have now been shown\nto be due to mutations of mtDNA. These include a variety of\nmyopathies, neurologic disorders, and some forms of diabetes\nmellitus.\nGENETIC MATERIAL CAN BE\nAL\nTERED & REARRANGED\nAn alteration in the sequence of purine and pyrimidine bases\nin a gene d\nue to a change\u2014a removal or an insertion\u2014of one\nor more bases may result in an altered gene product or altera-\ntion of gene expression if nonprotein coding DNA is involved."

The backbone of\nthe circularized bacteriophage genome is broken, as is that\nof the DNA molecule of the host; the appropriate ends are\nresealed with the proper polarity. The bacteriophage DNA is\nfiguratively straightened out (\u201clinearized\u201d) as it is integrated\ninto the bacterial DNA molecule\u2014frequently a closed circle as\nwell. The site at which the bacteriophage genome integrates or\nrecombines with the bacterial genome is chosen by one of two\nmechanisms. If the bacteriophage contains a DNA sequence\nhomologous to a sequence in the host DNA molecule, thena recombination event analogous to that occurring between\nhomologous chromosomes can occur. However, some bacte-\nriophages synthesize proteins that bind specific sites on bac-\nterial chromosomes to a nonhomologous site characteristic\nof the bacteriophage DNA molecule. Integration occurs at the\nsite and is said to be \u201csite specific . \u201d\nMany animal viruses, particularly the oncogenic viruses\u2014\neither directly or, in the case of RNA viruses such as HIV that\ncauses AIDS, double-stranded DNA copies generated by the\naction of the viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase , or\nreverse transcriptase \u2014can be integrated into chromosomes\nof the mammalian cell. Integration of the viral DNA into the\ngenome of the infected cells generally is not \u201csite specific\u201d but\ndoes display site preferences. Not surprisingly a subset of such\nintegration events is mutagenic.\nTransposition Can Produce\nProcessed \nGenes\nIn eukaryotic cells, small DNA elements that clearly are not\nviruses \nare capable of transposing themselves in and out of\nthe host genome in ways that affect the function of neigh-\nboring DNA sequences. These mobile elements, sometimes\ncalled \u201cjumping DNA ,\u201dor jumping genes, can carry flanking\nregions of DNA and, therefore, profoundly affect evolution.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Alu family of moderately repeated\nDNA sequences has structural characteristics similar to the\ntermini of retroviruses, which would account for the ability\nof the latter to move into and out of the mammalian genome.\nDirect evidence for the transposition of other small DNA\nelements into the human genome has been provided by the\ndiscovery of \u201c processed genes \u201d for immunoglobulin mol-\necules, \u03b1-globin molecules, and many others.

This particular DNA sequence arrangement\nmust have resulted from the reverse transcription of an appro-\npriately processed messenger RNA molecule from which the\nintron regions had been removed and the poly(A) tail added.\nThe only recognized mechanism that this reverse transcript\ncould have used to integrate into the genome would have been\na transposition event. In fact, these \u201cprocessed genes\u201d have\nshort terminal repeats at each end, as do known transposed\nsequences in other organisms. In the absence of their tran-\nscription and thus genetic selection for function, many of the\nprocessed genes have been randomly altered through evolu-\ntion so that they now contain nonsense codons that preclude\ntheir ability to encode a functional, intact protein even if they\ncould be transcribed (see Chapter 37). Thus, such transposed\nsequences are referred to as \u201c pseudogenes . \u201d\nGene Conversion Produces\nRearrangements\nBesides unequal crossover and transposition, a third mecha-\nnism can ef\nfect rapid changes in the genetic material. Similar\nsequences on homologous or nonhomologous chromosomes\nmay occasionally pair up and eliminate any mismatched\nsequences between them. This may lead to the accidental fixa-\ntion of one variant or another throughout a family of repeated\nsequences and thereby homogenize the sequences of the\nmembers of repetitive DNA families. This process is referred\nto as gene conversion .\nSister Chromatids Exchange\nIn diploid eukaryotic organisms such as humans, after cells\nprogr\ness through the DNA synthetic, or S phase of the mitotic\ncell cycle (see Figure 35\u201320), they contain a tetraploid content\nof DNA. This is in the form of sister chromatids of chromo-\nsome pairs (see Figure 35\u20136). Each of these sister chromatids\ncontains identical genetic information since each is a prod-\nuct of the semiconservative replication of the original par-\nent DNA molecule of that chromosome. Crossing over can\noccur between these genetically identical sister chromatids.\nOf course, these sister chromatid exchanges (Figure 35\u201312 )\nhave no genetic consequence as long as the exchange is the\nresult of an equal crossover.\nImmunoglobulin Genes Rearrange\nIn mammalian cells, some interesting gene rearrangements\noccur \nnormally during development and differentiation. For\nexample, the VLand CLgenes, which encode for the immuno-\nglobulin G (IgG) light-chain variable (VL) and constant (CL)\nportions \nof the IgG light chain in a single IgG molecule (see\nChapters 38, 52), are widely separated in the germ line DNA.\nIn the DNA of a differentiated IgG-producing (plasma) cell,the same VLand CLgenes have been moved physically clos er,\nand linked together in the genome within a single transcrip-\ntion unit. However, even then, this rearrangement of DNA\nduring differentiation does not bring the VLand CLgenes\ninto \ncontiguity in the DNA. Instead, the DNA contains an\nintron of about 1200 bp at or near the junction of the V and C\nregions. This intron sequence is transcribed into RNA along\nwith the VLand CLexons, and the interspersed, intronic non-\nIgG sequence information is removed from the RNA during\nits nuclear processing via mRNA splicing (see Chapters 36\nand 38).\nDNA SYNTHESIS & REPLICATION\nARE \nRIGIDLY CONTROLLED\nThe primary function of DNA replication is the provision of\npr\nogeny with the genetic information possessed by the parent.\nThus, the replication of DNA must be complete and carried\nout in such a way as to maintain genetic stability within the\norganism and the species. The process of DNA replication is\ncomplex and involves many cellular functions and several\nverification procedures to ensure fidelity in replication. About\n30 proteins are involved in the replication of the Escherichia coli\nchromosome; this process is significantly more complex in\neukaryotic organisms.FIGURE 35\u201312 Sister chromatid exchanges between human\nchrom\nosomes. The exchanges are detectable by Giemsa staining\nof the chromosomes of cells replicated for two cycles in the pres-\nence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU ; 5-Bromo-2 \u2032-deoxyuridine; see\nFigure 32\u201313 with a depiction of 5-Iodo-2 \u2032deoxyuridine).

Therefore, mechanisms must exist\nto target the site of initiation of replication and to unwind the\ndsDNA in that region. The replication complex must then form.\nAfter replication is complete in an area, the parent and daughter\nstrands must reform dsDNA. In eukaryotic cells, an additional\nstep must occur. The dsDNA must reform the chromatin struc-\nture, including nucleosomes that existed prior to the onset of\nreplication. Although this entire process is not completely\nunderstood in eukaryotic cells, replication has been quite pre-\ncisely described in prokaryotic cells, and the general principles\nare the same in both. The major steps are listed in Table 35\u20134 ,\nillustrated in Figure 35\u201313 , and discussed, in sequence, in fol-\nlowing discussion. A number of proteins, most with specific\nenzymatic action, are involved in this process ( Table 35\u20135 ).\nThe Origin of Replication\nAt the origin of replication (ori) , there is an association of\nsequence-specific dsDNA-binding proteins with a series of\ndirect repeat DNA sequences. In E. coli , the origin of DNAsynthesis termed oriC is bound by the protein dnaA, which\nforms a complex consisting of 150 to 250 bp of DNA and\nmultimers of this single-strand DNA-binding protein. This\nbinding event leads to the local denaturation and unwinding\nof an adjacent A+T-rich region of DNA.

This figure describes DNA replication in an E. coli cell, but the general steps are similar\nin eukaryotes. A specific interaction of a protein (the dnaA protein) to the origin of replication (oriC) results in local unwinding of DNA at an adja-\ncent A+T-rich region. The DNA in this area is maintained in the single-strand conformation (ssDNA) by single-strand-binding proteins (SSBs). This\nallows a variety of proteins, including helicase, primase, and DNA polymerase, to bind and to initiate DNA synthesis. The replication fork proceeds\nas DNA synthesis occurs continuously (long red arrow) on the leading strand and discontinuously (short black arrows) on the lagging strand. The\nnascent DNA is always synthesized in the 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction, as DNA polymerases can add a nucleotide only to the 3 \u2032end of a DNA strand."

The ORE binds a set of proteins, analogous to the dnaA\nprotein of E. coli , the group of proteins is collectively called\ntheorigin recognition complex (ORC) . ORC homologs have\nbeen found in all eukaryotes examined. The ORE is located\nadjacent to an approximately 80-bp A+T-rich sequence that is\neasy to unwind. This is called the DNA unwinding element\n(DUE) . The DUE is the origin of replication in yeast and is\nbound by the MCM protein complex.\nConsensus sequences similar in sequence to oriC or ARS\nin structure have not been precisely defined in mammalian\ncells. However, several of the proteins that participate in ori\nrecognition and function have been identified in human cells\nand appear quite similar to their yeast counterparts in both\namino acid sequence and function. This fact argues that at the\nfunctional level ORE-like elements exist in humans.\nUnwinding of DNA\nThe interaction of proteins with ori defines the start site of\nreplica\ntion and provides a short region of ssDNA essential for\ninitiation of synthesis of the nascent DNA strand. This pro-\ncess requires the formation of a number of protein\u2013protein\nand protein-DNA interactions. A critical step is provided by\na DNA helicase that allows for processive unwinding of DNA.\nThis function is provided by a complex of dnaB helicase and\nthe dnaC protein. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins\n(SSBs) stabilize this complex once formed.\nFormation of the Replication Fork\nA replication fork consists of four components that form in\nthe \nfollowing order: (1) the DNA helicase unwinds a short seg-\nment of the parental duplex DNA; (2) SSBs bind to ssDNA and\nprevent premature reannealing of ssDNA back into dsDNA;\n(3) a primase initiates synthesis of an RNA molecule that is\nessential for priming DNA synthesis; and (4) the DNA poly-\nmerase initiates nascent, daughter-strand synthesis on the free\n3\u2032-OH of the primer.\nThe DNA polymerase III enzyme (the dnaE gene prod-\nuct in E. coli ) binds to template DNA as part of a multiproteincomplex that consists of several polymerase accessory factors\n(\u03b2\u2032, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b4 \u2032, and \u03c4). DNA polymerases only synthesize DNA\nin the 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction, and only one of the several differ-\nent types of polymerases is involved at the replication fork.\nBecause the DNA strands are antiparallel (see Chapter 34),\nthe polymerase functions asymmetrically. On the leading\n(forward) strand , the DNA is synthesized continuously. On\nthelagging (retrograde) strand , the DNA is synthesized\nin short (1-5 kb; see Figure 35\u201316) fragments, the so-called\nOkazaki fragments , so named after the scientist who discov-\nered them. Several Okazaki fragments (up to 1000) must be\nsequentially synthesized for each replication fork. To ensure that\nthis happens, the helicase acts on the lagging strand to unwind\ndsDNA in a 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction. The helicase associates with the\nprimase to afford the latter proper access to the template. This\nallows the RNA primer to be made and, in turn, the polymerase\nto begin replicating the DNA. This is an important reaction\nsequence since DNA polymerases cannot initiate DNA synthesis\nde novo. The mobile complex between helicase and primase\nhas been called a primosome . As the synthesis of an Okazaki\nfragment is completed and the polymerase is released, a new\nprimer has been synthesized. The same polymerase molecule\nremains associated with the replication fork and proceeds to\nsynthesize the next Okazaki fragment.\nThe DNA Polymerase Complex\nA number of different DNA polymerase molecules engage\nin \nDNA replication. These share three important properties:\n(1)chain elongation , (2) processivity , and (3) proofread-\ning. Chain elongation accounts for the rate (in nucleotides\nper second ;nt/s) at which polymerization (ie, phosphodiester\nbond formation) occurs. Processivity is an expression of the\nnumber of nucleotides added to the nascent chain before the\npolymerase disengages from the template. The proofreading\nfunction identifies copying errors and corrects them. In E. coli ,\nDNA polymerase III (pol III) functions at the replication fork.\nOf all polymerases, it catalyzes the highest rate of chain elon-\ngation and is the most processive. It is capable of polymerizing\n0.5 Mb of DNA during one cycle on the leading strand. Pol III\nis a large (>1 MDa), multisubunit protein complex in E. coli .\nDNA pol III associates with the two identical \u03b2 subunits of the\nDNA sliding \u201cclamp\u201d; this association dramatically increases\npol III-DNA complex stability, processivity (100 to >50,000\nnucleotides) and rate of chain elongation (20-50 nt/s) generat-\ning the high degree of processivity the enzyme exhibits.\nPolymerase I (pol I) and II (pol II) are mostly involved in\nproofreading and DNA repair. Eukaryotic cells have counter-\nparts for each of these enzymes plus a large number of addi-\ntional DNA polymerases primarily involved in DNA repair. A\ncomparison is shown in Table 35\u20136 .\nIn mammalian cells, the polymerase is capable of polym-\nerizing at a rate that is somewhat slower than the rate of\npolymerization of deoxynucleotides by the bacterial DNA\npolymerase complex.

In E. coli primer formation is catalyzed by dnaG\n(primase), in eukaryotes DNA Pol \u03b1 synthesizes these RNA\nprimers. Once complete DNA synthesis commences on this\nshort RNA primer. The priming process involves nucleophilic\nattack by the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the RNA primer on the\nphosphate of the first entering deoxynucleoside triphosphate\n(Nin Figure 35\u201314) with the splitting off of pyrophosphate;\nthis transition to DNA synthesis is catalyzed by the appro-\npriate DNA polymerases (DNA pol III in E. coli; DNA pol \u03b4\nand \u03b5 in eukaryotes). The 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the recently\nattached deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate is then free to\ncarry out a nucleophilic attack on the next entering deoxy-\nribonucleoside triphosphate (N + 1 in Figure 35\u201314), again\nat its \u03b1 phosphate moiety, with the splitting off of pyrophos-\nphate. Of course, selection of the proper deoxyribonucleo-\ntide whose terminal 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group is to be attacked is\ndependent on proper base pairing with the other strand of the\nDNA molecule according to Watson and Crick base pairing\nrules ( Figure 35\u201315 ). When an adenine deoxyribonucleoside\nmonophosphoryl moiety is in the template position, a thymi-\ndine triphosphate will interact with the dXTP binding site of\nthe DNA polymerase and its \u03b1 phosphate will be attacked by\nthe 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleoside monophos-\nphoryl most recently added to the polymer. By this stepwise\nprocess, the template dictates which deoxyribonucleoside\ntriphosphate is complementary, and by hydrogen bonding,\nholds it in place while the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the growing\nstrand attacks and incorporates the new nucleotide into the\npolymer. These segments of DNA attached to an RNA primer\ncomponent are the Okazaki fragments ( Figure 35\u201316 ). In\nboth bacteria and mammals, after many Okazaki fragments\nare generated, the replication complex begins to remove the\nRNA primers, to fill in the gaps left by their removal with the\nproper base-paired deoxynucleotide, and then to seal the frag-\nments of newly synthesized DNA by enzymes referred to as\nDNA ligases .Replication Exhibits Polarity\nAs has already been noted, DNA molecules are double\nstranded and the \ntwo strands are antiparallel. The replication\nof DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes occurs on both strands\nsimultaneously. However, an enzyme capable of polymerizing\nDNA in the 3 \u2032to 5\u2032direction does not exist in any organism,\nso that both of the newly replicated DNA strands cannot grow\nin the same direction simultaneously. Nevertheless, in bacteria\nthe same enzyme does replicate both strands at the same time\n(in eukaryotes pol \u03b5 and pol \u03b4 catalyze leading and lagging\nstrand synthesis; see Table 35\u20136). The single enzyme replicates\none strand (\u201cleading strand\u201d) in a continuous manner in the\n5\u2032to 3\u2032direction, with the same overall forward direction. It\nreplicates the other strand (\u201clagging strand\u201d) discontinuously\nwhile polymerizing the nucleotides in short spurts of 150 to\n250 nucleotides, again in the 5 \u2032to 3\u2032direction, but at the same\ntime it faces toward the back end of the preceding RNA primer\nrather than toward the unreplicated portion. This process of\nsemidiscontinuous DNA synthesis is shown diagrammati-\ncally in Figures 35\u201313 and 35\u201316.\nFormation of Replication Bubbles\nReplication of the circular bacterial chromosome, composed\nof r\noughly 5 \u00d7 106bp o f DNA proceeds from a single ori. This\nprocess is completed in about 30 minutes, a replication rate of\n3 \u00d7 105bp/min. The entire mammalian genome replicates in\napproximately 9 hours, the average period required for forma-\ntion of a tetraploid genome from a diploid genome in a rep-\nlicating cell. If a mammalian genome (3 \u00d7 109bp) replicated\nat the same rate as bacteria (ie, 3 \u00d7 105bp/min) from but a\nsingle ori, replication would take over 150 hours! Metazoan\norganisms get around this problem using two strategies. First,\nreplication is bidirectional. Second, replication proceeds from\nmultiple origins in each chromosome (a total of as many as\n100 in humans). Thus, replication occurs in both directions\nalong all of the chromosomes, and both strands are replicated\nsimultaneously. This replication process generates \u201c replication\nbubbles \u201d (Figure 35\u201317 ).\nThe multiple ori sites that serve as origins for DNA repli-\ncation in eukaryotes are poorly defined except in a few animal\nviruses and in yeast. However, it is clear that initiation is regu-\nlated both spatially and temporally, since clusters of adjacent\nsites initiate replication synchronously. Replication firing, or\nDNA replication initiation at a replicator/ori, is influenced by\na number of distinct properties of chromatin structure that\nare just beginning to be understood. It is clear, however, that\nthere are more replicators and excess ORC than needed to\nreplicate the mammalian genome within the time of a typi-\ncal S phase. Therefore, mechanisms for controlling the excess\nORC-bound replicators must exist. Understanding the control\nof the formation and firing of replication complexes is one of\nthe major challenges in this field.\nDuring the replication of DNA, there must be a separa-\ntion of the two strands to allow each to serve as a template\nby hydrogen bonding its nucleotide bases to the incomingTABLE 35\u20136 A Comparison of Prokaryotic & Eukaryotic\nDNA \nPolymerases\nE. coli Eukaryotic Function\nI  Gap filling following DNA replication,\nrepair, and recombination\nII  DNA proofreading and repair\n\u03b2 DNA repair\n\u03b3 Mitochondrial DNA synthesis\nIII \u03b5 Processive, leading strand synthesis\nDnaG \u03b1 Primase\n\u03b4 Processive, lagging strand synthesis"

These molecules\nstabilize the single-stranded structure as the replication fork\nprogresses. The stabilizing proteins bind cooperatively and\nstoichiometrically to the single strands without interfering\nwith the abilities of the nucleotides to serve as templates (see\nFigure 35\u201313). In addition to separating the two strands of the\ndouble helix, there must be an unwinding of the molecule (once\nevery 10 nucleotide pairs) to allow strand separation. The hexa-\nmeric dnaB protein complex unwinds DNA in E. coli , whereas\nthe hexameric MCM complex unwinds eukaryotic DNA. This\nunwinding happens in segments adjacent to the replication bub-\nble. To counteract this unwinding, there are multiple \u201cswivels\u201dinterspersed in the DNA molecules of all organisms. The swivel\nfunction is provided by specific enzymes that introduce \u201cnicks\u201d\nin one strand of the unwinding double helix , thereby allow-\ning the unwinding process to proceed. The nicks are quickly\nresealed without requiring energy input, because of the for-\nmation of a high-energy covalent bond between the nicked\nphosphodiester backbone and the nicking-sealing enzyme. The\nnicking-resealing enzymes are called DNA topoisomerases .\nThis process is depicted diagrammatically in Figure 35\u201318 and\nthere compared with the ATP-dependent resealing carried out\nby the DNA ligases (see Table 39\u20132). Topoisomerases are also\ncapable of unwinding supercoiled DNA.

The nick-sealing reaction at the top is catalyzed by DNA\ntopoisomerase I and is ATP-energy independent because the energy for reformation of DNA phosphodiester bonds is stored within the covalent\nattachment of topoisomerase I to DNA (P-E; top; step ii). Bond reformation is accomplished by the nucleophilic attack of the 3 \u2032OH group (green arrow,\nstep iii) to the phosphate of the P-E complex.

A specific\nvirus-encoded nuclease, RNase H , degrades the hybridized\ntemplate RNA strand. Subsequently, the remaining DNA strand\nin turn serves as a template for the viral reverse transcriptase to\nform a dsDNA molecule containing the genetic information\noriginally present in the RNA genome of the animal virus. The\nresulting dsDNA can then integrate into the host genome, and\nfrom this integrated proviral DNA, viral genes can be expressed\nvia transcription using host cell machinery.\nReconstitution of Chromatin Structure\nThere is evidence that nuclear organization and chromatin\nstructure \nare involved in determining the regulation and ini-\ntiation of DNA synthesis. As noted earlier, the rate of polym-\nerization in eukaryotic cells, which have chromatin and\nnucleosomes, is slower than that in prokaryotic cells, which\nlack canonical nucleosomes. It is also clear that chromatin\nstructure must be reformed after replication. Newly replicated\nDNA is rapidly assembled into nucleosomes, and the preexist-\ning and newly assembled histone octamers are randomly dis-\ntributed to each arm of the replication fork. These reactions\nare facilitated through the actions of histone chaperone pro-\nteins working in concert with chromatin assembly and remod-\neling complexes.DNA Synthesis Occurs During the\nS \nPhase of the Cell Cycle\nIn eukaryotic cells, including human cells, the replication of the\nDN\nA genome occurs only at a specified time during the mitotic\nlife cycle of the cell. This period is referred to as the Synthetic\norS phase . S phase is temporally separated from the Mitotic ,\nor M phase (where duplicated chromosomes distribute equally\nto both daughter cells), and by two non-DNA synthetic periods\nreferred to as gap 1 ( G1)andgap 2 ( G2) phases , which occur\nbefore and after the S phase, respectively ( Figure 35\u201320 ).\nAmong other things, the cell prepares for DNA synthesis in\nG1, and for mitosis in G2. The cell regulates DNA synthesis by\nallowi\nng it to occur only once per cell cycle, and only during\nS phase, in cells preparing to divide by a mitotic process.\nAll eukaryotic cells have gene products that govern the tran-\nsition from one phase of the cell cycle to another. The cyclins\nare a family of proteins whose intracellular concentrations\ncyclically increase and decrease at specific times during the cell\ncycle\u2014thus their name. The cyclins activate, at the appropriate\ntime, different cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) that\nphosphorylate substrates essential for progression through the\ncell cycle ( Figure 35\u201321 ). For example, cyclin D levels rise in\nlateG1phase and allow progression beyond the start (yeast)\norrestriction point (mammals) , the point beyond which cells\nirrevocably proceed into the S or DNA synthesis phase.FIGURE 35\u201319 Supercoiling of DNA. A left-handed toroidal\n(solenoidal) supercoil, at left, will convert to a right-handed inter-\nwound supercoil, at right, when the cylindric core is removed. Such a\ntransition is analogous to that which occurs when nucleosomes are\ndisrupted by the high salt extraction of histones from chromatin.\nImproper spindle\ndetect\ned\nDamaged DNA\ndetectedDamaged DNA\ndetectedG2\nG1M\nS\nIncomplete\nreplication\ndetect\ned\nFIGURE 35\u201320 Progress through the mammalian cell cycle\nis \ncontinuously monitored via multiple cell-cycle checkpoints.\nDNA, chromosome, and chromosome segregation integrity are\ncontinuously monitored throughout the cell cycle.

In some cases, if the damage cannot be repaired, such cells\nundergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Note that cells can\nreversibly leave the cell cycle during G1entering a nonreplicative\nstate termed G0(not shown, but see Figure 9\u20138).

These two kinases\nare also synthesized during G1in cells under going active divi-\nsion. The D cyclins and CDK4 and CDK6 are nuclear proteins\nthat assemble as a complex in late G1phase . The cyclin\u2013CDK\ncomplex is now an active serine\u2013threonine protein kinase. One\nsubstrate for this kinase is the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein.\nRb is a cell-cycle regulator because it binds to and inactivates\na transcription factor (E2F) necessary for the transcription of\ncertain genes (histone genes, DNA replication proteins, etc.)\nneeded for progression from G1to S phase. The phos phoryla-\ntion of Rb by CDK4 or CDK6 results in the release of E2F from\nRb-mediated transcription repression\u2014thus, gene transcrip-\ntion activation ensues and cell-cycle progression takes place.\nOther cyclins and CDKs are involved in different aspects\nof cell-cycle progression ( Table 35\u20137 ). Cyclin E and CDK2\nform a complex in late G1. Cyclin E is rapidly degraded, and\nthe released \nCDK2 then forms a complex with cyclin A. This\nsequence is necessary for the initiation of DNA synthesis in\nS phase. A complex between cyclin B and CDK1 is rate-limiting\nfor the G2/M transition in eukaryotic cells.M\nany of the cancer-causing viruses (oncoviruses) and cancer-\ninducing genes (oncogenes) are capable of alleviating or\ndisrupting the restriction that normally controls the entry of\nmammalian cells from G1in to the S phase. From the foregoing,\none might have surmised that excessive production of a cyclin,\nloss of a specific CDK inhibitor (see following discussion), or\nproduction or activation of a cyclin/CDK at an inappropriate\ntime might result in abnormal or unrestrained cell division.\nSimilarly, the oncoproteins (or transforming proteins) produced\nby several DNA viruses target the Rb transcription repressor\nfor inactivation, inducing cell division inappropriately, while\ninactivation of Rb, itself a tumor suppressor gene, leads to\nuncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\nDuring the S phase, mammalian cells contain greater\nquantities of DNA polymerase than during the nonsynthetic\nphases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, those enzymes respon-\nsible for formation of the substrates for DNA synthesis\u2014that\nis, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates\u2014are also increased in\nactivity, and their expression drops following the synthetic\nphase until the reappearance of the signal for renewed DNA\nsynthesis. During the S phase, the nuclear DNA is completely\nreplicated once and only once . After chromatin has been rep-\nlicated, it is marked so as to prevent its further replication until\nit again passes through mitosis. This process is termed replica-\ntion licensing. The molecular mechanisms for this phenom-\nenon in human cells involve dissociation and/or cyclin\u2013CDK\nphosphorylation and subsequent degradation of several origin\nbinding proteins that play critical roles in replication complex\nformation. Consequently, origins fire only once per cell cycle.\nIn general, a given pair of chromosomes will replicate\nsimultaneously and within a fixed portion of the S phase on\nevery replication. On a chromosome, clusters of replication\nunits replicate coordinately. The nature of the signals that reg-\nulate DNA synthesis at these levels is unknown, but the regula-\ntion does appear to be an intrinsic property of each individual\nchromosome that is mediated by the several replication ori-\ngins contained therein.\nAll Organisms Contain Elaborate\nEvol\nutionarily Conserved Mechanisms\nto Repair Damaged DNA\nRepair of damaged DNA is critical for maintaining genomic\nintegrity \nand thereby preventing the propagation of muta-\ntions, either horizontally (somatic cells), or vertically (germ\ncells). DNA is subjected to a huge array of chemical, physi-\ncal, and biologic assaults on a daily basis ( Table 35\u20138 ), hence\nefficient recognition and repair of DNA lesions is essential.\nConsequently, eukaryotic cells contain five major DNA repair\npathways, each of which contain multiple, sometimes shared\nproteins; these DNA repair proteins typically have orthologues\nin prokaryotes. The mechanisms of DNA repair include nucle-\notide excision repair (NER); mismatch repair (MMR); base\nexcision repair (BER); homologous recombination (HR);\nand nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways\n(Figure 35\u201322 ).

These multiple kinases phos-\nphorylate and consequently modulate the activities of dozens\nof proteins, such as numerous DNA repair, checkpoint con-\ntrol, and cell-cycle control proteins like CDC25A, B, C, Wee1,\np21, p16, and p19 (all cyclin\u2013CDK regulators [see Figure 9\u20138;\nand following discussion]; various exo- and endonucleases;\nDNA single-strand-specific DNA-binding proteins [RPA];\nPCNA and specific DNA polymerases [DNA pol \u03b4 and \u03b7]).\nSeveral of these (types of) proteins/enzymes have been dis-\ncussed earlier in the context of DNA replication. DNA repair\nand its relationship to cell-cycle control are very active areas of\nresearch given their central roles in cell biology and potential\nfor generating and preventing cancer.\nDNA & Chromosome Integrity Is\nMonitored \nThroughout the Cell Cycle\nGiven the importance of normal DNA and chromosome\nfunction \nto survival and propagation, it is not surprising\nthat eukaryotic cells have developed elaborate mechanisms\nto monitor the integrity of the genetic material. As detailed\nearlier, a number of complex multisubunit enzyme systems have\nevolved to repair damaged DNA at the nucleotide sequence\nlevel. Similarly, DNA mishaps at the chromosome level are also\nmonitored and repaired. As shown in Figure 35\u201320, both\nDNA and chromosomal integrity are continuously monitored\nthroughout the cell cycle. The four specific steps at which this\nmonitoring occurs have been termed checkpoint controls . If\nproblems are detected at any of these checkpoints, progres-\nsion through the cycle is interrupted and transit through the\ncell cycle is halted until the damage is repaired. The molecular\nmechanisms underlying detection of DNA damage during the\nG1andG2phases of the cycle are understood better than those\noperative during S and M phases.\nThe tumor suppressor p53 , a protein of apparent MW\n53 kDa on SDS-PAGE, plays a key role in both G1and G2\ncheckpoin\nt control. Normally a very unstable protein, p53 is a\nDNA-binding transcription factor, one of a family of related\nproteins (ie,p53,p63, and p73) that is stabilized in response\nto DNA damage, perhaps by direct p53-DNA interactions.\nLike the histones discussed earlier, p53 is subject to a pano-\nply of regulatory PTMs, all of which likely modify its multiple\nbiologic activities. Increased levels of p53 activate transcrip-\ntion of an ensemble of genes that collectively serve to delay\ntransit through the cycle. One of these induced proteins, p21,\nis a potent CDK\u2013cyclin inhibitor (CKI) that is capable of\nefficiently inhibiting the action of all CDKs. Clearly, inhibi-\ntion of CDKs will halt progression through the cell cycle (see\nFigures 35\u201320 and 35\u201321). If DNA damage is too extensive to\nrepair, the affected cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell\ndeath ) in a p53-dependent fashion. In this case, p53 induces\nthe activation of a collection of genes that induce apoptosis\n(see Figure 56\u20139). Cells lacking functional p53 fail to undergo\napoptosis in response to high levels of radiation or DNA-activechemotherapeutic agents. It may come as no surprise, then,\nthatp53is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human\ncancers (see Chapter 56). Indeed, recent genomic sequencing\nstudies of a multitude of tumor DNA samples suggest that over\n80% of human cancers carry p53 loss-of-function mutations.\nAdditional research into the mechanisms of checkpoint con-\ntrol will prove invaluable for the development of effective anti-\ncancer therapeutic options.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0DNA in eukaryotic cells is associated with a variety of proteins,\nresulting \nin a structure called chromatin.\n\u25a0Much of the DNA is associated with histone proteins to form\na structure \ncalled the nucleosome. Nucleosomes are composed\nof an octamer of histones around which about 150 bp of DNA\nis wrapped.\n\u25a0Histones are subject to an extensive array of dynamic covalent\nmodifications \nthat have important regulatory consequences.\n\u25a0Nucleosomes and higher-order structures formed from them\nser\nve to compact the DNA.\n\u25a0DNA in transcriptionally active regions is relatively more\nsensitive \nto nuclease attack in vitro. This property is used as a\nproxy for a relative increase in DNA accessibility; some regions,\nso-called hypersensitive sites are exceptionally sensitive and\nsuch DNA regions are often found to contain transcription\ncontrol sites.\n\u25a0Highly transcriptionally active DNA (genes) is often clustered\nin r\negions of each chromosome. Within these regions, genes\nmay be separated by inactive DNA in nucleosomal structures.\nIn many eukaryotic transcription units (ie, the portion of\na gene that is copied by RNA polymerase) often consists\nof protein-coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by\nintervening sequences of nonprotein-coding DNA (introns).\nThis is particularly true for mRNA-encoding genes.\n\u25a0After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are\nremov\ned and the exons are ligated together to form the mature\nRNAs that appear in the cytoplasm; this process is termed RNA\nsplicing.\n\u25a0DNA in each chromosome is exactly replicated according to\nthe rules o\nf base pairing during the S phase of the cell cycle.\n\u25a0Each strand of the double helix is replicated simultaneously but by\nso\nmewhat different mechanisms. A complex of proteins, including\nDNA polymerase, replicates the leading strand continuously in the\n5\u2032to 3\u2032direction. The lagging strand is replicated discontinuously,\nin short pieces of 100 to 250 nucleotides by DNA polymerase\nsynthesizing in the 5 \u2032 \u21923\u2032direction.\n\u25a0DNA replication is initiated at special sites termed origins to\ngenerat\ne replication bubbles. Each eukaryotic chromosome\ncontains multiple origins. The entire process takes about 9 hours\nin a typical human cell and only occurs during the S phase of\nthe cell cycle.\n\u25a0A variety of mechanisms that employ different enzyme systems\nrepa\nir damaged cellular DNA after exposure of cells to chemical\nand physical mutagens.\n\u25a0Normal cells containing DNA that cannot be repaired either\nundergo \nsenescence or programmed cell death via apoptosis."

The transcription \u201cbubble\u201d is an approximately\n20-bp area of melted DNA, and the entire complex covers 30 to 75 bp\nof DNA depending on the conformation of RNAP .\nFIGURE 36\u20133 The transcription cycle. The transcription cycle can be described in six steps: (1) Template binding and closed RNA\npolymerase-promoter complex formation: RNAP binds to DNA and then locates a promoter ( P) DNA sequence element. (2) Open promoter\ncomplex formation: Once bound to the promoter, RNAP melts the two DNA strands to form an open promoter complex; this complex is also\nreferred to as the preinitiation complex or PIC. Strand separation allows the polymerase to access the coding information in the template strand\nof DNA. (3) Chain initiation: Using the coding information of the template, RNAP catalyzes the coupling of the first base (often a purine) to the\nsecond, template-directed ribonucleoside triphosphate to form a dinucleotide (in this example forming the dinucleotide 5 \u2032pppApNOH3\u2032).\n(4) \nPromoter clearance: After RNA chain length reaches ~10 to 20 nt, the polymerase undergoes a conformational change and then is able to\nmove away from the promoter, transcribing down the transcription unit. On many genes \u03c3-factor is released from RNAP at this phase of the tran-\nscription cycle. (5) Chain elongation: Successive residues are added to the 3 \u2032-OH terminus of the nascent RNA molecule until a transcription ter-\nmination DNA sequence element ( T) is encountered by RNAP . (6) Chain termination and RNAP release: Upon encountering the transcription\ntermination site, RNAP undergoes an additional conformational change that leads to release of the completed RNA chain, the DNA template,\nand RNAP . Following reformation of holoenzyme (E\u03c3), RNAP can rebind to DNA beginning the promoter search process and the cycle is repeated.\nNote that all of the steps in the transcription cycle are facilitated by additional proteins, and indeed are often subjected to regulation by positive-\nand/or negative-acting factors."

The magnification is\nabout 6000\u00d7. Note that the length of the transcripts increases as the\nRNA polymerase molecules progress along the individual rRNA genes\nfrom transcription start sites (filled circles) to transcription termina-\ntion sites (open circles). RNA polymerase I (not visualized here) is at\nthe base of the nascent rRNA transcripts. Thus, the proximal end of\nthe transcribed gene has short transcripts attached to it, while much\nlonger transcripts are attached to the distal end of the gene. The\narrows indicate the direction (5 \u2032\u21923\u2032) of transcription.\nFIGURE 36\u20135 Prokaryotic promoters share two regions of highly conserved nucleotide sequence. These regions are located 35- and\n10-bp upstream of the TSS, which is indicated as +1. By convention, all nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site (at +1) are num-\nbered in a negative sense and are referred to as 5 \u2032-flanking sequences, while sequences downstream of the +1 TSS are numbered in a positive sense.\nAlso, by convention, the promoter DNA regulatory sequence elements such as the \u221235 and the \u221210 TATAAT elements are described in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032\ndirection and as being on the coding strand. These elements function only in double-stranded DNA. Other transcriptional regulatory elements,\nhowever, can often act in a direction independent fashion, and such cis-elements are drawn accordingly in any schematic (see Figure 36\u20138). Note\nthat the transcript produced from this transcription unit has the same polarity or \u201csense\u201d (ie, 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032orientation) as the coding strand. Termination-\ndetermining cis-elements reside at the end of the transcription unit (see Figure 36\u20136 for more detail). By convention, the sequences downstream\nof the site at which transcription termination occurs are termed 3 \u2032-flanking sequences."

(A )Bacterial RNAP can directly terminate transcrip-\ntion following the recognition of both specific RNA and DNA signals within transcripts/transcription units. In such situations, the transcription\ntermination signal contains an inverted, hyphenated repeat (the two boxed areas) followed by a stretch of A nucleotides in the template strand\n(here, bottom strand). The inverted repeat-containing sequences, when transcribed into RNA, can generate a secondary structure like that pres-\nent in the RNA transcript shown. Formation of this RNA hairpin causes RNA polymerase to pause and on recognition of the polyA sequence in\nthe template strand induces transcription chain termination. (B)In cases where genes do not contain the two cis-elements noted earlier, a novel\nguanine-rich element in the DNA, and an accessory transcription factor, the \u03c1-protein, together serve to facilitate transcription termination. The\ntranscript contains a run of C-residues that serve as a binding site for the \u03c1-factor, itself a hexameric ATPase. When present in the transcript, this\nelement, termed the \u03c1-factor utilization site, or rut, is directly recognized by \u03c1-factor. On rut element binding, its intrinsic ATPase activity is acti-\nvated and \u03c1-factor translocates 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 on the transcript until \u03c1 encounters the transcribing RNA polymerase. \u03c1-factor-RNAP interaction induces\ntranscription termination and DNA, RNA, and protein dissociation."

DNA-dependent\nRNA \npolymerase II (not shown) binds to the region encompassing the TATA box (which is shown here bound by transcription factor TFIID) and\nTSS at +1 (see also Figure 36\u20139) to form a multicomponent PIC capable of initiating transcription at a single nucleotide (+1 TSS). The frequency of\nthis event is increased by the presence of upstream cis-acting elements (the GC and CAAT boxes) located either near to the promoter (promoter\nproximal) or distant from the promoter (distal elements; see Figure 36\u20138). Proximal and distal DNA cis-elements are bound by trans -acting tran-\nscriptional activating factors, in this example Sp1 and CTF (also called C/EBP , NF1, NFY) bound to proximal elements. Most proximal and distal\ncis-elements can function independently of orientation (arrows; see also Figure 36-8).\nFIGURE 36\u20138 Schematic showing the transcription control regions in a hypothetical mRNA-producing eukaryotic gene transcribed\nby \nRNA polymerase II. Such a gene can be divided into its coding and regulatory regions, as defined by the transcription start site (arrow; +1).\nThe coding region contains the DNA sequence that is transcribed into mRNA, which is ultimately translated into protein, typically after extensive\nmRNA processing via splicing (see Figures 36\u201312 to 36\u201316). The regulatory region consists of two classes of elements. One is responsible for\nensuring basal expression. The \u201cpromoter,\u201d often composed of the TATA box and/or Inr and/or DPE elements (see Table 36\u20133), directs the RNA\npolymerase II transcription machinery to the correct site (fidelity). However, in certain genes that lack a consensus TATA, the so-called TATA-less\npromoters, an initiator (Inr) and/or DPE element(s) may direct the polymerase to this site. Another component, the upstream elements, speci-\nfies the frequency of initiation; such elements can either be proximal (50\u2013200 bp) or distal (1000\u2013105bp) to the promoter as shown. Among the\nbest studied of the proximal elements is the CAAT box, but several other elements (bound by the transactivator proteins Sp1, NF1, AP1, etc.;\nTable 36\u20133) may be used in various genes. The distal elements enhance or repress expression, several of which mediate the response to various\nsignals, including hormones, heat shock, heavy metals, and chemicals. Tissue-specific expression also involves specific sequences of this sort.\nThe orientation dependence of all the elements is indicated by the arrows within the boxes. For example, the proximal promoter elements\n(TATA box, INR, DPE) must be in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032orientation, while the proximal upstream elements often work best in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032orientation but, most\ncan be reversed. The locations of some elements are not fixed with respect to the transcription start site. Indeed, some elements responsible for\nregulated expression can be located interspersed with the upstream elements or can be located downstream from the start site, within, or even\ndownstream of the regulated gene itself."

Formation of the basal transcription complex begins when TFIID binds, via\nits TATA binding protein (TBP) subunit and several of its 14 TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits, to the TATA box. TFIID then directs the assembly\nof several other components by protein-DNA and protein\u2013protein interactions: TFIIA, B, E, F, H, and polymerase II (pol II). The entire complex\nspans DNA from about positions \u221230 to +30 relative to the TSS at +1 (marked by bent arrow). The atomic level, X-ray\u2013derived structures of RNA\npolymerase II alone and of the TBP subunit of TFIID bound to TATA promoter DNA in the presence of either TFIIB or TFIIA have all been solved at\n3-\u00c5 resolution. The structures of mammalian and yeast basal transcription complexes (aka preinitiation complexes, or PICs) have also recently\nbeen determined at 10-\u00c5 resolution by electron microscopy. Thus, the molecular structures of the transcription machinery in action are begin-\nning to be elucidated. Much of this structural information is consistent with the models presented here."

Shown in ( A), is an inactive mRNA encoding gene (see Xover the +1 transcription start site/TSS) with a single\ndimeric transcription factor (Activator-1; violet ovals) bound to its cognate enhancer binding site ( Activator-1 ). This particular enhancer element\nwas nucleosome-free and hence available for interaction with its cognate activator binding protein. However, this gene is still inactive (X over\nTSS) due to the fact that a portion of its enhancer (in this illustration the enhancer is bipartite and composed of Activator-1 andActivator-2 , DNA-\nbinding sites) andthe promoter are covered by nucleosomes. Recall that nucleosomes have ~150 bp of DNA wound around the histone octamer.\nHence, the single nucleosome over the promoter will occlude access of the transcription machinery (pol II + GTFs) to the TATA, Inr and/or DPE\npromoter elements. ( B) Enhancer DNA-bound Activator-1 interacts with any of a number of distinct ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and\nchromatin-modifying coregulator complexes. These coregulators together have the ability to both move, or remodel (ie, change the octameric\nhistone content, and/or remove nucleosomes) through the action of various ATP-dependent remodelers as well as to covalently modify nucleo-\nsomal histones using intrinsic acetylases (HAT; resulting in acetylation [Ac]) and methylases (SET; resulting in methylation [Me], among other\nPTMs; Table 35\u20131) carried by subunits of these complexes. ( C) The resulting changes in nucleosome position and nucleosome occupancy (ie,\nnucleosomes \u22124, 0 and +1), composition (nucleosome \u22121 and nucleosome +2; replacement of nucleosomal H2A with histone H2AX[Z]) thus\nallows for the binding of the second Activator-2 dimer to Activator-2 DNA sequences, which ultimately allows for the binding of the transcription\nmachinery (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H; polymerase II and mediator) to the promoter (TATA-INR-DPE) and the formation of an active PIC, which leads to\nactivated transcription (large arrow at TSS)."

RNA processing factors (ie, SR/RRM-\nmotif-containing splicing factors as well as polyadenylation and termination factors) interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD, composed of\nmultiple copies of a heptapeptide with consensus sequence \u2013YSPTSPS-) of pol II, while mRNA packaging and transport factors such as TREX\ncomplex (pink ovals) are recruited to the nascent mRNA primary transcript, either through direct pol II interactions as shown or, through interac-\ntions with SR/splicing factors (brown circles) resident on the nascent mRNA precursor molecules. Note that the CTD is not drawn to scale. The\nevolutionarily conserved CTD of the Rpb1 subunit of pol II is in reality 5 to 10 times the length of the polymerase due to its many prolines and\nconsequent unstructured nature, and thus a significant docking site for RNA processing and transport proteins among many other critical mRNA\nmetabolizing activities (ie, mRNA polyadenylation and transcription termination factors). In both cases, nascent mRNA chains are thought to be\nmore rapidly and accurately processed due to the immediate recruitment of these many factors to the growing mRNA (precursor) chain.\nFollowing appropriate mRNA processing, the mature mRNA is delivered to the nuclear pores (Figures 36\u201317, 49\u20134) dotting the nuclear membrane,\nwhere, upon transport through the pores, the mRNAs can be engaged by ribosomes and translated into protein."

(Left) miRNA encoding genes are transcribed by RNA pol II into a pri-\nmary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which is 5 \u2032-capped and polyadenylated as is typical of mRNA coding primary transcripts. This pri-miRNA is subjected\nto processing within the nucleus by the action of the Drosha-DGCR8 nuclease, which trims sequences from both 5 \u2032and 3 \u2032ends to generate the\npre-miRNA. This partially processed double-stranded RNA is transported through the nuclear pore by exportin-5. The cytoplasmic pre-miRNA is\nthen trimmed further by the action of the heterodimeric nuclease termed Dicer (TRBP-Dicer), to form the 21\u201322 nt miRNA duplex. One of the two\nresulting 21\u201322 nucleotide-long RNA strands is selected, the duplex unwound, and the selected strand loaded into the RNA-induced silencing\ncomplex, or RISC complex containing one of several Ago proteins (Ago1, 2, 3, or 4) and other important accessory proteins, thereby generating\nthe mature, functional miRNA. Following target mRNA location and sequence-specific miRNA\u2013mRNA annealing, the functional miRNA can\nmodulate mRNA function by one of three mechanisms: translational repression, mRNA destabilization by mRNA deadenylation, or mRNA degradation.\n(Right ) The siRNA pathway generates functional siRNAs from large double-stranded RNAs that are formed either intracellularly by RNA\u2013RNA\nhybridization (inter- or intramolecular) or from extracellular sources such as RNA viruses. These viral dsRNAs are again processed to ~22 nt siRNA\ndsRNA segments via the heterodimeric Dicer nuclease, loaded into the Ago2-containing RISC complex, one strand is then selected to generate\nthe siRNA that locates target RNA sequences via sequence-specific siRNA\u2013RNA annealing. This ternary target RNA\u2013siRNA\u2013Ago2 complex induces\nRNA cleavage, which inactivates the target RNA."

Within the protein-coding genes, these nucleotides\nare organized into three-letter code words called codons , and\nthe collection of these codons, once transcribed into mRNA,\nmake up the genetic code . It was impossible to understand\nprotein synthesis\u2014or to explain the molecular effects of gene\nmutations\u2014before the genetic code was deciphered.

The mRNA is processed within the nucleus, and\nthe introns, which typically make up much more of this RNA\nthan the exons, are removed. Exons are spliced together to\nform mature mRNAs, which are transported to the cytoplasm,\nwhere they are translated into protein (see Chapter 36).\nThe cell must possess the machinery necessary to trans-\nlate information accurately and efficiently from the nucleotide\nsequence of an mRNA into the sequence of amino acids of the\ncorresponding specific protein. Clarification of our under-\nstanding of this process, which is termed translation , awaited\ndeciphering of the genetic code. It was realized early that mRNA\nmolecules themselves have no affinity for amino acids and,\ntherefore, that the translation of the information in the mRNA\nnucleotide sequence into the amino acid sequence of a protein\nrequires an intermediate adapter molecule. This adapter mol-\necule must recognize a specific nucleotide sequence on the one\nhand as well as a specific amino acid on the other. With such an\nadapter molecule, the cell can direct a specific amino acid into\nthe proper sequential position of a protein during its synthesis\nas dictated by the nucleotide sequence of the specific mRNA.\nThe functional groups of the amino acids do not themselves\nactually come into contact with the mRNA template.\nTHE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE OF\nAN \nmRNA MOLECULE CONTAINS\nA SERIES OF CODONS THAT\nSPECIFY THE AMINO ACID\nSEQUENCE OF THE ENCODED\nPROTEIN\nTwenty different amino acids are required for the synthe-\nsis \nof the cellular complement of proteins; thus, there must\nbe at least 20 distinct codons that make up the genetic code.\nSince there are only four different nucleotides in mRNA, each\ncodon must consist of more than a single purine or pyrimidine\nnucleotide. Codons consisting of two nucleotides each could\nprovide for only 16 (ie, 42) distinct codons, whereas codons of\nthree n\nucleotides could provide 64 (43) specific codons.\nI\nt is now known that each codon consists of a sequence of\nthree nucleotides; that is, it is a triplet code (Table 37\u20131 ). The\ninitial deciphering of the genetic code depended heavily on\nin vitro synthesis of nucleotide polymers, particularly triplets\nin repeated sequence. These synthetic triplet ribonucleotides\nwere used as mRNAs to program protein synthesis in the test\ntube, which allowed investigators to deduce the genetic code.\nTHE GENETIC CODE IS\nDEGENERA\nTE, UNAMBIGUOUS,\nNONOVERLAPPING, WITHOUT\nPUNCTUATION, & UNIVERSAL\nThree of the 64 possible codons do not code for specific amino\nacids; \nthese have been termed nonsense codons . Nonsense\ncodons are utilized in the cell as translation terminationsignals by specifying where the polymerization of amino acids\ninto a protein molecule is to stop. The remaining 61 codons code\nfor the 20 naturally occurring amino acids (see Table 37\u20131).\nThus, there is \u201c degeneracy \u201d in the genetic code\u2014that is, multi-\nple codons decode the same amino acid. Some amino acids are\nencoded by several codons; for example, six different codons,\nUCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, and AGC all specify serine.\nOther amino acids, such as methionine and tryptophan, have\na single codon. In general, the third nucleotide in a codon is\nless important than the first two in determining the specific\namino acid to be incorporated, and this accounts for most of\nthe degeneracy of the code. However, for any specific codon,\nonly a single amino acid is specified; with rare exceptions, the\ngenetic code is unambiguous \u2014that is, given a specific codon,\nonly a single amino acid is indicated. The distinction between\nambiguity anddegeneracy is an important concept.\nThe unambiguous but degenerate code can be explained\nin molecular terms. The recognition of specific codons in the\nmRNA by the tRNA adapter molecules is dependent on the\ntRNA anticodon region and specific base-pairing rules that\ndictate tRNA\u2013mRNA codon binding. Each tRNA molecule\ncontains a specific sequence, complementary to a codon, which\nis termed its anticodon.

However, some tRNA molecules can uti-\nlize the anticodon to recognize more than one codon. With\nfew exceptions, given a specific codon, only a specific amino\nacid will be incorporated\u2014although, given a specific amino\nacid, more than one codon may be used.\nAs discussed in the following section, the reading of the\ngenetic code during the process of protein synthesis does not\ninvolve any overlap of codons. Thus, the genetic code is non-\noverlapping . Furthermore, once the reading is commenced\nat a specific start codon, there is no punctuation between\ncodons, and the message is read in a continuing sequence of\nnucleotide triplets until a translation stop codon is reached.\nUntil recently, the genetic code was thought to be univer-\nsal. It has now been shown that the set of tRNA molecules in\nmitochondria (which contain their own separate and distinct\ntranslation machinery) from lower and higher eukaryotes,\nincluding humans, reads four codons differently from the\ntRNA molecules in the cytoplasm of even the same cells. As\nnoted in a footnote to Table 37\u20131, in mammalian mitochon-\ndria the codon AUA is read as Met, and UGA codes for Trp. In\naddition, in mitochondria, the codons AGA and AGG are read\nas stop or chain terminator codons rather than as Arg. As a\nresult of these organelle-specific changes in genetic code, mito-\nchondria require only 22 tRNA molecules (see Figure 35\u20138\nfor the location of these genes in mtDNA) to read their genetic\ncode, whereas the cytoplasmic translation system possesses a\nfull complement of 31 tRNA species. These exceptions noted,\nthe genetic code is universal . The frequency of use of each\namino acid codon varies considerably between species and\namong different tissues within a species. The specific tRNA\nlevels generally mirror these codon usage biases. Thus, a particu-\nlar abundantly used codon is decoded by a similarly abundant-\nspecific tRNA which recognizes that particular codon. Tables of\ncodon usage are quite accurate now that many genomes have\nbeen sequenced and such information is vital for large-scale\nproduction of proteins for therapeutic purposes (ie, insulin,\nerythropoietin). Such proteins are often produced in nonhu-\nman cells using recombinant DNA technology (see Chapter 39).A summary of the main features of the genetic code are listed\ninTable 37\u20132 .\nAT LEAST ONE SPECIES OF\ntRNA \nEXISTS FOR EACH OF\nTHE 20 AMINO ACIDS\ntRNA molecules have extraordinarily similar functions and\nthree-dimensional \nstructures. The adapter function of the\ntRNA molecules requires the charging of each specific tRNA\nwith its specific amino acid. Since there is no affinity of nucleic\nacids for specific functional groups of amino acids, this rec-\nognition must be carried out by a protein molecule capable\nof recognizing both a specific tRNA molecule and a specific\namino acid. At least 20 specific enzymes are required for these\nspecific recognition functions and for the proper attachment\nof the 20 amino acids to specific tRNA molecules. This energy\nrequiring process of recognition and attachment, tRNA\namino acid charging , proceeds in two steps and is catalyzed\nby one enzyme for each of the 20 amino acids. These enzymes\nare termed aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases . They form an\nactivated intermediate of aminoacyl-AMP\u2013enzyme complex\n(Figure 37\u20131) . The specific aminoacyl-AMP\u2013enzyme com-\nplex then recognizes a specific tRNA to which it attaches the\naminoacyl moiety at the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl adenosyl terminal. The\ncharging reactions have an error rate of less than 10\u22124and so\nare quite accurate. The amino acid remains attached to its\nspecific tRNA in an ester linkage until it is incorporated at a\nspecific position during the synthesis of a polypeptide on the\nribosome.\nThe regions of the tRNA molecule referred to in Chapter 34\n(and illustrated in Figure 34\u201311) now become important.

The tRNA dihydrouridine (D)\narm is one of the sites important for the proper recognition of a\ngiven tRNA species by its proper aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\nThetRNA acceptor arm , located at the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl adenosyl\nterminal, is the site of attachment of the specific amino acid.\nThe anticodon region (arm) consists of seven nucleotides,\nand it recognizes the three-letter codon in mRNA ( Figure 37\u20132 ).\nThe sequence read from the 3 \u2032to 5\u2032direction in that anticodon\nloop consists of a variable base (N)\u2013modified purine (Pu*)\u2013XYZ\n(the\n anticodon)\u2013pyrimidine (Py)\u2013pyrimidine (Py)-5 \u2032. Note that\nthis direction of reading the anticodon is 3 \u2032\u20135\u2032, whereas the\ngenetic code in Table 37\u20131 is read 5 \u2032\u20133\u2032, since the codon and the\nanticodon loop of the mRNA and tRNA molecules, respectively,\nare antiparallel in their complementarity just like all other inter-\nmolecular interactions between nucleic acid strands.\nThe degeneracy of the genetic code resides mostly in the last\nnucleotide of the codon triplet, suggesting that the base pairing\nbetween this last nucleotide and the corresponding nucleotide\nof the anticodon is not strictly by the Watson-Crick rule. This\nis called wobble ; the pairing of the codon and anticodon can\n\u201cwobble\u201d at this specific nucleotide-to-nucleotide pairing site.\nFor example, the two codons for arginine, AGA and AGG, can\nbind to the same anticodon having an uracil at its 5 \u2032end (UCU).\nSimilarly, three codons for glycine\u2014GGU, GGC, and GGA\u2014\ncan form a base pair from one anticodon, 3 \u2032CCI 5 \u2032, because\ninosine (I) can base pair with U, C, and A. Inosine is generated\nby deamination of adenine (see Figure 33\u20132 for structure).MUTATIONS RESULT WHEN\nCHANGES \nOCCUR IN THE\nNUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE\nAlthough the initial change may not occur in the template\nstrand \nof the double-stranded DNA molecule for that gene,\nafter replication, daughter DNA molecules with mutations in\nthe template strand will segregate and appear in the popula-\ntion of organisms.\nSome Mutations Occur by Base\nSubstitution\nSingle-base changes (point mutations) may be transitions or\ntransversions . In the former, a given pyrimidine is changed to\nthe other pyrimidine or a given purine is changed to the other\npurine. Transversions are changes from a purine to either of\nthe two pyrimidines or the change of a pyrimidine into either\nof the two purines, as shown in Figure 37\u20133 .\nWhen the DNA nucleotide sequence of a protein-coding\ngene containing the mutation is transcribed into an mRNA\nmolecule, then the RNA molecule will of course possess the\nbase change at the corresponding location.\nSingle-base changes in the mRNA may have one of several\neffects when translated into protein:\n1.There may be no detectable effect because of the degeneracy\nof the code; such mutations are often referred to as silent\nmutations . This would be most likely if the changed base in\nthe mRNA molecule were to be at the third nucleotide of a\ncodon. Because of wobble, the translation of a codon is least\nsensitive to a change at the third position.\n2.Amissense effect will occur when a different amino acid is\nincorporated at the corresponding site in the protein mol-\necule. This mistaken amino acid\u2014or missense, depending\non its location in the specific protein\u2014might be accept-\nable, partially acceptable, or unacceptable to the function\nof that protein molecule. From a careful examination of\nthe genetic code, one can conclude that most single-base\nchanges would result in the replacement of one amino acid\nby another with rather similar functional groups. This is an\neffective genetic \u201cbuffering\u201d mechanism to avoid drastic\nchange in the physical properties of a protein molecule. If\nan acceptable missense effect occurs, the resulting protein\nmolecule may not be distinguishable from the normal one.\nFIGURE 37\u20132 Recognition of the codon by the anticodon.\nOne \nof the codons for phenylalanine is UUU. tRNA charged with\nphenylalanine (Phe) has the complementary sequence AAA; hence,\nit forms a base-pair complex with the codon.

The\nprobability is high that a prematurely terminated protein\nmolecule or peptide fragment will not function in its nor-\nmal role.

The\nmachinery translating the mRNA does not recognize that a\nbase was missing, since there is no punctuation in the reading\nof codons. Thus, a major alteration in the sequence of polym-\nerized amino acids, as depicted in Example 1, Figure 37\u20135,\nresults. Altering the reading frame results in a garbled trans-\nlation of the mRNA distal to the single nucleotide deletion.\nNot only is the sequence of amino acids distal to this dele-\ntion garbled, but reading of the message can also result in the\nappearance of a nonsense codon and thus the production of apolypeptide both garbled and prematurely terminated (Example 3,\nFigure 37\u20135).\nIf three nucleotides or a multiple of three nucleotides are\ndeleted from a coding region, translation of the corresponding\nmRNA will generate a protein that is missing the correspond-\ning number of amino acids (Example 2, Figure 37\u20135). Because\nthe reading frame is a triplet, the reading phase will not be\ndisturbed for those codons distal to the deletion. If, however,\ndeletion of one or two nucleotides occurs just prior to or\nwithin the normal termination codon (nonsense codon), the\nreading of the normal termination signal is disturbed. Such a\ndeletion might result in reading through the now \u201cmutated\u201d\ntermination signal until another nonsense codon is encoun-\ntered (not shown here).\nInsertions of one or two or nonmultiples of three nucle-\notides into a gene result in an mRNA in which the reading\nframe is distorted on translation, and the same effects that\noccur with deletions are reflected in the mRNA translation.\nThis may result in garbled amino acid sequences distal to\nthe insertion and the generation of a nonsense codon at, or\ndistal to the insertion, or perhaps reading through the normal\ntermination codon. Following a deletion in a gene, an inser-\ntion (or vice versa) can reestablish the proper reading frame\n(Example 4, Figure 37\u20135). The corresponding mRNA, when\ntranslated, would contain a garbled amino acid sequence\nbetween the insertion and deletion. Beyond the reestablish-\nment of the reading frame, the amino acid sequence would\nbe correct. One can imagine that different combinations of\ninsertions or deletions (ie,indels ), or of both, would result in\nFIGURE 37\u20134 Examples of three types of missense mutations resulting in abnormal hemoglobin chains.

This new tool adds significantly to biolo-\ngists interested in studying the mechanisms of a wide range of\nbiologic processes.\nLIKE TRANSCRIPTION, PROTEIN\nSYNTHESIS\n CAN BE DESCRIBED\nIN THREE PHASES: INITIATION,\nELONGATION, & TERMINATION\nThe general structural characteristics of ribosomes are discussed\nin \nChapter 34. These particulate entities serve as the machinery\non which the mRNA nucleotide sequence is translated into the\nsequence of amino acids of the specified protein. The translation\nof the mRNA commences near its 5 \u2032end with the formation of\nthe corresponding amino terminus of the protein molecule. The\nmessage is decoded from 5 \u2032to 3\u2032, concluding with the formation\nof the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Again, the concept of\npolarity is apparent. As described in Chapter 36, the transcrip-\ntion of a gene into the corresponding mRNA or its precursor\nfirst forms the 5 \u2032end of the RNA molecule. In prokaryotes, this\nallows for the beginning of mRNA translation before the tran-\nscription of the gene is completed. In eukaryotic organisms, the\nprocess of transcription is a nuclear one, while mRNA trans-\nlation occurs in the cytoplasm, precluding simultaneous tran-\nscription and translation in eukaryotic organisms and enabling\nthe processing necessary to generate mature mRNA from the\nprimary transcript.\nInitiation Involves Several Protein-RNA\nComplexes\nInitiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis requires that an\nmRN\nA molecule be selected for translation by a ribosome\n(Figure 37\u20136 ). Once the mRNA binds to the ribosome, the ribo-\nsome must locate the initiation codon thereby setting the correct\nreading frame on the mRNA, and translation begins. This pro-\ncess involves tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, and at least 10 eukaryotic\ninitiation factors (eIFs) , some of which have multiple (three to\neight) subunits. Also involved are GTP , ATP , and amino acids.\nInitiation can be divided into three steps, all of which are obliga-\ntorily preceded by dissociation of the 80S ribosome into its con-\nstituent 40S and 80S subunits: (1) binding of a ternary complex\nconsisting of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (met-tRNAi),\nGTP\n, and eIF-2 to the 40S ribosome to form the 43S preini-\ntiation complex ; (2) binding of mRNA to the 40S preinitiation\ncomplex to form the 48S initiation complex ; and (3) combina-\ntion of the 48S initiation complex with the 60S ribosomal sub-\nunit to form the 80S initiation complex .\nRibosomal Dissociation\nPrior to initiation, 80S ribosomes dissociate into component\n40S and 60S subunits during transla\ntion termination (see fol-\nlowing discussion). Dissociation allows these components to\nparticipate in subsequent rounds of translation. Two initiationfactors, eIF-3, eIF-1, andeIF-1A , bind to the newly dissoci-\nated 40S ribosomal subunit. Binding of these three eIFs delay\nreassociation of the 40S subunit with the 60S subunit, allow-\ning other translation initiation factors to associate with the\n40S subunit.\nFormation of the 43S Preinitiation Complex\nThe first step of translation initiation involves the binding of\nGTP \nby eIF-2. This binary complex then binds to methionyl\ntRNAi, a tRNA specifically involved in binding to the initiation\ncodo\nn AUG. It is important to note that there are two tRNAs for\nmethionine. One specifies methionine for the initiator codon,\nthe other for internal methionines. Each has a unique nucleotide\nsequence; both are aminoacylated by the same methionyl-tRNA\nsynthetase. The GTP-eIF-2-tRNAite rnary complex binds to the\n40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex.\nThe ternary complex\u201340S subunit complex is stabilized by eIF-3\nand eIF-1A and the subsequent binding of eIF5.\neIF-2 is one of two control points for protein synthesis ini-\ntiation in eukaryotic cells. eIF-2 consists of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits.\neIF-2\u03b1 is phosphorylated (on serine 51) by at least four dif-\nferent protein kinases (HCR, PKR, PERK , and GCN2) that\nare activated when a cell is under stress and when the energy\nexpenditure required for protein synthesis would be deleteri-\nous. Such conditions include amino acid or glucose starva-\ntion, virus infection, intracellular presence of large quantities\nof misfolded proteins (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress),\nserum deprivation (for cells in culture), hyperosmolality, and\nheat shock. PKR is particularly interesting in this regard. This\nkinase is activated by viruses and provides a host defense mech-\nanism that decreases protein synthesis, including viral protein\nsynthesis, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Phosphorylated\neIF-2\u03b1 binds tightly to and inactivates the GTP\u2013GDP recycling\nprotein eIF-2B, thus preventing formation of the 43S preinitia-\ntion complex and blocking protein synthesis.\nFormation of the 48S Initiation Complex\nAs described in Chapter 36, the 5 \u2032termini of mRNA mole-\ncules in eukaryotic cells are \u201ccapped. \u201d The7meG-cap facilitates\nthe \nbinding of mRNA to the 43S preinitiation complex. A cap-\nbinding protein complex, eIF-4F (4F) , which consists of\neIF-4E (4E) and the eIF-4G (4G)-eIF-4A (4A) complex , binds\nto the cap through the 4E protein. Subsequently eIF-4B (4B)\nbinds and reduces the complex secondary structure of the 5 \u2032\nend of the mRNA through its ATP-dependent helicase activity.\nThe association of mRNA with the 43S preinitiation complex\nto form the 48S initiation complex requires ATP hydrolysis.\neIF-3 is a key protein because it binds with high affinity to the\n4G component of 4F, and links this complex to the 40S ribo-\nsomal subunit. Following association of the 43S preinitiation\ncomplex with the mRNA cap, and reduction (\u201cmelting\u201d) of the\nsecondary structure near the 5 \u2032end of the mRNA through the\naction of the 4B helicase and ATP , the complex translocates\n5\u2032\u2192 3\u2032and scans the mRNA for a suitable initiation codon.\nGenerally, this is the 5 \u2032-most AUG, but the precise initiation"

In\naddition to binding 4E, 4G binds to eIF-3, which links the complex\nto the 40S ribosomal subunit.

This process is further\nregulated by phosphorylation (see Figure 37\u20138). Insulin and\nmitogenic growth factors result in the phosphorylation of 4E\non Ser209 (or Thr210). Phosphorylated 4E binds to the cap\nmuch more avidly than does the nonphosphorylated form,\nthus enhancing the rate of initiation. Components of the MAP\nkinase, PI3K, mTOR, RAS, and S6 kinase signaling pathways\n(see Figure 42\u20138) can all, under appropriate conditions, be\ninvolved in these regulatory phosphorylation reactions.\nThe activity of 4E is modulated in a second way, and this\nalso involves phosphorylation; a set of proteins bind to and inac-\ntivate 4E. These proteins include 4E-BP1 (BP1, also known as\nPHAS-1 ) and the closely related proteins 4E-BP2 and4E-BP3 .\nBP1 binds with high affinity to 4E. The 4E-BP1 association pre-\nvents 4E from binding to 4G (to form 4F). Since this interaction\nis essential for the binding of 4F to the ribosomal 40S subunit\nand for correctly positioning it on the capped mRNA, BP-1\neffectively inhibits translation initiation.\nInsulin and other growth factors result in the phosphory-\nlation of BP-1 at seven unique sites. Phosphorylation of BP-1results in its dissociation from 4E, and it cannot rebind until\ncritical sites are dephosphorylated. These effects on the activa-\ntion of 4E explain in part how insulin causes a marked post-\ntranscriptional increase of protein synthesis in liver, adipose,\nand muscle tissue.\nElongation Is Also a Multistep,\nAcc\nessory Factor-Facilitated Process\nElongation is a cyclic process on the ribosome in which one\namino \nacid at a time is added to the nascent peptide chain\n(Figure 37\u20139 ). The peptide sequence is determined by the\norder of the codons in the mRNA. Elongation involves several\nsteps catalyzed by proteins called elongation factors (EFs).\nThese steps are (1) binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site,\n(2) peptide bond formation, (3) translocation of the ribosome\non the mRNA, and (4) expulsion of the deacylated tRNA from\nthe P- and E-sites.\nBinding of Aminoacyl-tRNA to the A Site\nIn the complete 80S ribosome formed during the process of ini-\ntia\ntion, both the A site (aminoacyl or acceptor site ) and E site\n(deacylated tRNA exit site ) are free (see Figure 37\u20136). The bind-\ning of the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site requires\nproper codon recognition. Elongation factor 1A (EF1A) forms\na ternary complex with GTP and the entering aminoacyl-tRNA\n(see Figure 37\u20139). This complex then allows the correct aminoacyl-\ntRNA to enter the A site with the release of EF1A-GDP and\nphosphate. GTP hydrolysis is catalyzed by an active site on\nthe ribosome; hydrolysis induces a conformational change in\nthe ribosome concomitantly increasing affinity for the tRNA.\nAs shown in Figure 37\u20139, EF1A-GDP then recycles to EF1A-\nGTP with the aid of other soluble protein factors and GTP .\nPeptide Bond Formation\nThe \u03b1-amino group of the new aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site\ncarries \nout a nucleophilic attack on the esterified carboxyl\ngroup of the peptidyl-tRNA occupying the P site (peptidyl\nor polypeptide site ). At initiation, this site is occupied by the\ninitiator met-tRNAi. This reaction is catalyzed by a peptidyl\ntransferase , \na component of the 28S RNA of the 60S ribo-\nsomal subunit. This is another example of ribozyme activity\nand indicates an important\u2014and previously unsuspected\u2014\ndirect role for RNA in protein synthesis ( Table 37\u20133 ). Because\nthe amino acid on the aminoacyl-tRNA is already \u201cactivated, \u201d\nno further energy source is required for this reaction. The\nreaction results in attachment of the growing peptide chain to\nthe tRNA in the A site.\nTranslocation\nThe now deacylated tRNA is attached by its anticodon to the\nP \nsite at one end and by its open 3 \u2032CCA tail to the E site on\nthe large ribosomal subunit (middle portion of Figure 37\u20139).\nAt this point, elongation factor 2 (EF2) binds to and displaces\nthe peptidyl tRNA from the A site to the P site.

The 4F complex consists of\neIF-4E (4E), eIF-4A (4A), and eIF-4G (4G). 4E is inactive when bound\nby one of a family of binding proteins (4E-BPs). Insulin and mitogenic\ngrowth polypeptides, or growth factors (eg, IGF-1, PDGF, interleu-\nkin-2, and angiotensin II) activate the PI3 kinase/AKT kinase signal-\ning pathways, which activate the mTOR kinase; this results in the\nphosphorylation of 4E-BP (see Figure 42\u20138). Phosphorylated 4E-BP\ndissociates from 4E, and the latter is then able to form the 4F complex\nand bind to the mRNA cap. These growth polypeptides also induce\nphosphorylation of 4G itself by the mTOR and MAP kinase pathways\n(see Chapter 42). Phosphorylated 4F binds much more avidly to the\ncap than does nonphosphorylated 4F, which stimulates 48S initiation\ncomplex formation and hence translation."

Thus, the\nenergy requiring process of peptide synthesis occurs with great\nspeed and accuracy until a termination codon is reached.\nTermination Occurs When a Stop Codon\nIs \nRecognized\nIn comparison to initiation and elongation, termination is a\nrela\ntively simple process ( Figure 37\u201310 ). After multiple cycles\nof elongation culminating in polymerization of the specific\namino acids into a protein molecule, the stop or terminating\ncodon of mRNA (UAA, UAG, UGA) appears in the A site. Nor-\nmally, there is no tRNA with an anticodon capable of recognizing\nsuch a termination signal. Releasing factor 1 (RF1) recognizes\nthat a stop codon resides in the A site (see Figure 37\u201310). RF1\nis bound by a complex consisting of releasing factor 3 (RF3)\nwith bound GTP . This complex, with the peptidyl transferase,\npromotes hydrolysis of the bond between the peptide and the\ntRNA occupying the P site. Thus, a water molecule rather than\nan amino acid is added. This hydrolysis releases the protein\nand the tRNA from the P site. On hydrolysis and release, the\n80S ribosome dissociates into its 40S and 60S subunits, which\nare then recycled (see Figure 37\u20137). Therefore, the releasing\nfactors are proteins that hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA bond\nwhen a stop codon occupies the A site. The mRNA is then\nreleased from the ribosome, which dissociates into its compo-\nnent 40S and 60S subunits, and another cycle can be repeated\n(see Figure 37\u20136).FIGURE 37\u20139 Diagrammatic representation of the peptide\nelongation \nprocess of protein synthesis.

The proteins synthesized by\nthe attached polyribosomes are extruded into the cisternal space\nbetween the sheets of rough ER and are exported from there.\nSome of the protein products of the rough ER are packaged by\nthe Golgi apparatus for eventual export (see Figures 49\u20132, 49\u20136).\nThe polyribosomal particles free in the cytosol are responsible\nfor the synthesis of proteins required for intracellular functions.\nNontranslating mRNAs Can Form\nRibonucleoprotein \nParticles That\nAccumulate in Cytoplasmic Organelles\nTermed P Bodies or Stress Granules\nmRNAs, bound by specific packaging proteins and exported\nfrom \nthe nucleus as ribonucleoproteins particles (mRNPs )\nsometimes do not immediately associate with ribosomes to\nbe translated. Alternatively, under certain conditions where\ntranslation is slowed or stopped (cellular stress or developmen-\ntal cues among other signals/conditions) select, untranslated\nmRNAs can associate with a range of specific RNAs and pro-\nteins to form P bodies and the related stress granules (SG) .\nThese structures are biomolecular condensates composed of\ninteracting RNAs and proteins. P bodies can readily be visual-\nized via immunohistochemistry using appropriate antibodies\n(Figure 37\u201311 ). These cytoplasmic structures are related to\nsimilar small mRNA-containing granules found in neurons and\ncertain maternal cells. Overall P bodies (and SGs) are thought to\ncontribute importantly to mRNA metabolism. Over 35 distinct\nproteins have been suggested to reside exclusively or extensivelywithin P bodies. These proteins range from mRNA binding\nproteins to mRNA decapping enzymes, RNA helicases, and\nRNA exonucleases (5 \u2032-3\u2032and 3 \u2032-5\u2032), to components involved\nin miRNA function and mRNA quality control. Incorporation\nof an mRNA into such complexes is not an unequivocal \u201cdeath\nsentence. \u201d Indeed, though the mechanisms are not yet fully\nunderstood, certain mRNAs appear to be temporarily stored in\nP bodies (or SGs) and then retrieved and utilized for protein\ntranslation. This molecular behavior suggests that the cytoplas-\nmic functions of mRNA (translation and degradation) are con-\ntrolled, at least in part, by the dynamic interaction of mRNA\nwith polysomes and P body/SG protein/enzyme constituents.\nThe Machinery of Protein Synthesis Can\nRespond \nto Environmental Threats\nFerritin , a n iron-binding protein, prevents ionized iron (Fe2+)\nfrom reaching toxic levels within \ncells. Elemental iron stimu-\nlates ferritin synthesis by causing the release of a cytoplasmic\nprotein that binds to a specific region in the 5 \u2032nontranslated\nregion of ferritin mRNA. Disruption of this protein-mRNA\ninteraction activates ferritin mRNA and results in its translation.\nThis mechanism provides for rapid control of the synthesis of\na protein that sequesters Fe2+, a potentially toxic molecule (see\nFigur\nes 52\u20137 and 52\u20138). Similarly, environmental stress and\nstarvation inhibit the positive roles of mTOR (see Figures 37\u20138\nand 42\u20138) on promoting activation of eIF-4F and 48S com-\nplex formation.\nMany Viruses Co-opt the Host Cell\nProtein \nSynthesis Machinery\nThe protein synthesis machinery can also be modified in del-\neterious \nways. Viruses replicate by using host cell processes,\nincluding those involved in protein synthesis. Some viral\nmRNAs are translated much more efficiently than those of the\nhost cell (eg, encephalomyocarditis virus). Others, such as reo-\nvirus and vesicular stomatitis virus, replicate efficiently, and\nthus their very abundant mRNAs have a competitive advan-\ntage over host cell mRNAs for limited translation factors.\nOther viruses inhibit host cell protein synthesis by preventing\nthe association of mRNA with the 40S ribosome.\nPoliovirus and other picornaviruses gain a selective advan-\ntage by disrupting the function of the 4F complex. The mRNAs\nof these viruses do not have a cap structure to direct the bind-\ning of the 40S ribosomal subunit (see earlier). Instead, the 40S\nribosomal subunit contacts an internal ribosomal entry site\n(IRES) in a reaction that requires 4G but not 4E. The virus gains\na selective advantage by having a protease that attacks 4G and\nremoves the amino terminal 4E binding site. Now the 4E-4G\ncomplex (4F) cannot form, so the 40S ribosomal subunit can-\nnot be directed to host capped mRNAs, abolishing host cell pro-\ntein synthesis. The 4G fragment can direct binding of the 40S\nribosomal subunit to IRES-containing mRNAs, so viral mRNA\ntranslation is very efficient ( Figure 37\u201312 ). These viruses also\npromote the dephosphorylation of BP1 (PHAS-1), thereby\ndecreasing cap (4E)-dependent translation (see Figure 37\u20138).P bodies\nFIGURE 37\u201311 The P body is a cytoplasmic structure\ninv\nolved in mRNA metabolism.

The viral protein molecules translated from\nthese long mRNAs are subsequently cleaved at defined sites\nto provide the several specific viral proteins required for viral\nfunction. In animal cells, many cellular proteins are synthesized\nfrom the mRNA template as a precursor molecule, which then\nmust be modified to achieve the active protein. The prototype\nis insulin, a small protein having two polypeptide chains with\ninterchain and intrachain disulfide bridges. The molecule is\nsynthesized as a single chain precursor, or prohormone , which\nfolds to allow the formation of specific, intra- or intermolecular\ndisulfide bridges (see intramolecular disulfide bonds in insulin;\nFigure 41\u201312). A specific protease then clips out the segment\nthat connects the two chains which form the functional insulin\nmolecule (see Figure 41\u201312).\nMany other peptides are synthesized as precursor pro-\nproteins that require modifications before attaining biologic\nactivity. Many of the posttranslational modifications involve\nthe removal of amino terminal amino acid residues by specific\naminopeptidases (see Figure 41\u201314). By contrast, collagen, an\nabundant protein in the extracellular spaces of higher eukary-\notes, is synthesized as procollagen. Three procollagen poly-\npeptide molecules, frequently not identical in sequence, align\nthemselves in a particular way that is dependent on the exis-\ntence of specific amino terminal peptides (see Figure 5\u201311).Specific enzymes then carry out hydroxylations and oxida-\ntions of specific amino acid residues within the procollagen\nmolecules to provide cross-links for greater stability. Amino\nterminal peptides are cleaved off the molecule to form the final\nproduct\u2014a strong, insoluble collagen molecule. Many other\nposttranslational modifications of proteins occur. Covalent\nmodification by acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation,\nubiquitylation, and glycosylation is common (see Chapter 5;\nTable 35\u20131).\nMANY ANTIBIOTICS WORK\nB\nY SELECTIVELY INHIBITING\nPROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN BACTERIA\nRibosomes in bacteria and in the mitochondria of higher\neukaryotic \ncells differ from the mammalian ribosome\ndescribed in Chapter 34. The bacterial ribosome is smaller\n(70S vs 80S) and has a different, somewhat simpler comple-\nment of RNA and protein molecules. This difference can be\nexploited for clinical purposes because many effective anti-\nbiotics interact specifically with the proteins and RNAs of\nprokaryotic ribosomes and thus only inhibit bacterial pro-\ntein synthesis. This results in growth arrest (ie, bacteriostatic\naction) or death (ie, bactericidal action) of the bacterium. The\nmost useful members of this class of antibiotics (eg,tetracy-\nclines, lincomycin, erythromycin , and chloramphenicol )\ndo not interact with components of eukaryotic ribosomes\nand thus are not toxic to eukaryotes.

The 4E-4G complex (4F) directs the 40S ribosomal subunit to the typical capped\nmRNA (see text). However, 4G alone is sufficient for targeting the 40S subunit to the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of certain viral mRNAs.\nTo gain selective advantage, some viruses (eg, poliovirus) express a protease that cleaves the 4E binding site from the amino terminal end of 4G.\nThis truncated 4G can direct the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNAs that have an IRES but not to those that have a cap (ie, host cell mRNAs). The\nwidths of the arrows indicate the rate of translation initiation from the AUG codon in each example.

An operon can be\nregulated by a single promoter or regulatory region. The cistron\nis the smallest unit of genetic expression. A single mRNA\nthat encodes more than one separately translated protein is\nreferred to as a polycistronic mRNA . For example, the poly-\ncistronic lacoperon mRNA is translated into three separate\nproteins (see following discussion). Operons and polycistronic\nmRNAs are common in bacteria but not in eukaryotes.\nAninducible gene is one whose expression increases in\nresponse to an inducer oractivator , a specific positive regu-\nlatory signal. In general, inducible genes have relatively low\nbasal rates of transcription. By contrast, genes with high basal\nrates of transcription are often subject to downregulation by\nrepressors.\nThe expression of some genes is constitutive , meaning that\nthey are expressed at a reasonably constant rate and not known to\nbe subject to extensive regulation. Such genes are often referred\nto as housekeeping genes . As a result of mutation, some induc-\nible gene products become constitutively expressed. A mutation\nresulting in constitutive expression of what was formerly a regu-\nlated gene is called a constitutive mutation .\nAnalysis of Lactose Metabolism in\nE. \ncoliLed to the Discovery of the\nBasic Principles of Gene Transcription\nActivation & Repression\nJacob and Monod in 1961 described their operon model in\na classic paper. Their hypothesis was to a large extent based\non observations on the regulation of lactose metabolism by\nthe intestinal bacterium E. coli. The molecular mechanisms\nresponsible for the regulation of the genes involved in the\nmetabolism of lactose are now among the best-understood in\nany organism. \u03b2-Galactosidase hydrolyzes the \u03b2-galactoside\nlactose to galactose and glucose. The gene encoding\n\u03b2-galactosidase ( lacZ) is clustered with the genes encoding\nlactose permease ( lacY) and thiogalactoside transacetylase\n(lacA). The genes encoding these three enzymes, along with\nthelacpromoter and lacoperator (a regulatory region), and\nthelacIgene encoding the LacI repressor are physically linked\nand constitute the lacoperon as depicted in Figure 38\u20132 .\nOpe\nr\natorPromoter\nlacoperonlacI lacZ\nlacY lacACRE\nTSS\nFIGURE 38\u20132 The positional relationships of the protein\ncoding \nand regulatory elements of the ~6kbp lacoperon. lacZ\nencodes \u03b2-galactosidase, lacY encodes a permease, and lacA encodes\na transacetylase. lacIencodes the lacoperon repressor protein.

Each of the linked operon genes is transcribed\ninto one large polycistronic mRNA molecule that contains\nmultiple independent translation start (AUG) and stop (UAA)\ncodons for each of the three cistrons. Thus, each protein is\ntranslated separately, and they are not processed from a single\nlarge precursor protein.\nIt is now conventional to consider that a gene includes\nregulatory sequences as well as the region that encodes the\nprimary transcript. Although there are many historical excep-\ntions, a gene is generally italicized in lower case and the\nencoded protein, when abbreviated, is expressed in roman\ntype with the first letter capitalized. For example, the gene lacI\nencodes the repressor protein LacI. When E. coli is presented\nwith lactose or some specific lactose analogs under appro-\npriate nonrepressing conditions (eg, high concentrations of\nlactose, no or very low glucose in media; see following dis-\ncussion), the expression of the activities of \u03b2-galactosidase,\ngalactoside permease, and thiogalactoside transacetylase is\nincreased 100-fold to 1000-fold. This is a type A response, as\ndepicted in Figure 38\u20131. The kinetics of induction can be quite\nrapid; lac-specific mRNAs are fully induced within ~5 minutes\nafter addition of lactose to a culture; \u03b2-galactosidase protein is\nmaximal within 10 minutes. Under fully induced conditions,\nthere can be up to 5000 \u03b2-galactosidase molecules per cell, an\namount about 1000 times greater than the basal, uninduced\nlevel. Upon removal of the signal, that is, the inducer, the syn-\nthesis of these three enzymes declines.\nWhen E. coli is exposed to both lactose and glucose as\nsources of carbon, the cells first metabolize the glucose and\nthen temporarily stop growing until the genes of the lac\noperon become induced to provide the ability to metabolize\nlactose as a usable energy source. Although lactose is present\nfrom the beginning of the bacterial growth phase, the cell does\nnot induce those enzymes necessary for catabolism of lac-\ntose until glucose has been exhausted. This phenomenon was\nfirst thought to be attributable to repression of the lacoperon\nby some catabolite of glucose; hence, it was termed catabo-\nlite repression. It is now known that catabolite repression is\nin fact mediated by a catabolite activator protein (CAP) in\nconjunction 3\u2032,5\u2032cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP;\nsee Figure 18\u20135). This protein is also referred to as the cAMP\nregulatory protein (CRP). The expression of many inducible\nenzyme systems or operons in E. coli and other prokaryotes\nis sensitive to catabolite repression, as discussed in following\ndiscussion.\nThe physiology of induction of the lacoperon is well\nunderstood at the molecular level ( Figure 38\u20133) . Expression\nof the normal lacIgene of the lacoperon is constitutive; it is\nexpressed at a constant rate, resulting in formation of the sub-\nunits of the lac repressor . Four identical subunits with molec-\nular weights of 38,000 assemble into a tetrameric Lac repressor\nmolecule. The LacI repressor protein molecule, the product of\nlacI, has a very high affinity (dissociation constant, Kdabout\n10\u221213mol/L) for the operator locus. The operator locus is aregion of double-stranded DNA that exhibits a twofold rota-\ntional symmetry and an inverted palindrome (indicated by\narrows about the dotted axis) in a region that is 21-bp long,\nshown as follows:\nAt any one time, only two of the four subunits of the repres-\nsor appear to bind to the operator; within the 21-base-pair\noperator region nearly every base of each base pair is involved\nin LacI recognition and binding. Binding occurs mostly in the\nmajor groove without interrupting the base-paired, double-\nhelical nature of the operator DNA. The operator locus\n(ie, LacI binding site) is between the promoter , the site where\nthe DNA-dependent RNA polymerase attaches to commence\ntranscription, and the transcription initiation site of the lacZ\ngene , the structural gene for \u03b2-galactosidase (see Figures 38\u20132\nand 36\u20133). When bound to the operator locus, the LacI repres-\nsor molecule prevents transcription of the distal structural\ngenes, lacZ,lacY, and lacA by interfering with the binding of\nRNA polymerase to the promoter; RNA polymerase and LacI\nrepressor cannot be effectively bound to the lacoperon at the\nsame time. Thus, the LacI repressor molecule is a negative reg-\nulator , and in its presence (and in the absence of inducer; see\nfollowing discussion), expression from the lacZ,lacY, and lacA\ngenes is very, very low. There are normally about 30 repressor\ntetramer molecules in the cell, a concentration (3 \u00d7 10\u22128mo l/L)\nof tetramer sufficient to effect, at any given time, more than 95%\noccupancy of the one lacoperator element in a bacterium, thus\nensuring low (but not zero) basal lacoperon gene transcription\nin the absence of inducing signals.\nA lactose analog that is capable of inducing the lacoperon\nwhile not itself serving as a substrate for \u03b2-galactosidase is an\nexample of a gratuitous inducer . An example is isopropyl-\nthiogalactoside (IPTG). The addition of lactose or of a gra-\ntuitous inducer such as IPTG to bacteria growing on a poorly\nutilized carbon source (such as succinate) results in prompt\ninduction of the lacoperon enzymes. Small amounts of the\ngratuitous inducer or of lactose are able to enter the cell even\nin the absence of permease. The LacI repressor molecules\u2014\nboth those attached to the operator loci and those free in\nthe cytosol\u2014have a high affinity for the inducer. Binding\nof the inducer to repressor molecule induces a conforma-\ntional change in the structure of the repressor that causes a\ndecrease in operator DNA occupancy because its affinity for\nthe operator is now 104times lower ( Kdabout 10\u22129mol/L)\nthan \nthat of LacI in the absence of IPTG. DNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase can now more efficiently compete with LacI\nand bind to the promoter (ie, Figures 36\u20133 and 36\u20138), and\ntranscription will begin, although this process is relatively\ninefficient (see following discussion). In such a manner, an\ninducer derepresses the lacoperon and allows transcrip-\ntion of the genes encoding \u03b2-galactosidase, galactoside per-\nmease, and thiogalactoside transacetylase.

Derepression of the lacoperon allows the cell to\nsynthesize the enzymes necessary to catabolize lactose as an\nenergy source. Based on the physiology just described, IPTG-\ninduced expression of transfected plasmids bearing the lac\noperator\u2013promoter ligated to appropriate bioengineered con-\nstructs is commonly used to express mammalian recombinant\nproteins in E. coli.\nIn order for the RNA polymerase to form a PIC at the pro-\nmoter site most efficiently, the cAMP-CAP complex must also\nbe present in the cell. By an independent mechanism, the bac-\nterium accumulates cAMP only when it is starved for a source\nof carbon. In the presence of glucose\u2014or of glycerol in con-\ncentrations sufficient for growth\u2014the bacteria will lack suf-\nficient cAMP to bind to CAP because glucose inhibits adenylyl\ncyclase, the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP (see Chap-\nter 42). Thus, in the presence of glucose or glycerol, cAMP-\nsaturated CAP is lacking, so that the DNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase cannot initiate transcription of the lacoperon at\nthe maximal rate. However, in the presence of the CAP-cAMP\ncomplex, which binds to CAP Response Element (CRE )\nDNA just upstream of the promoter site, transcription occurs\nat maximal levels (see Figure 38\u20133). Studies indicate that a\nregion of CAP directly contacts the RNA polymerase (RNAP)\n\u03b1 subunit, and these protein\u2013protein interactions facilitate\nthe binding of RNAP to the promoter. Thus, the CAP-cAMP\nregulator is acting as a positive regulator because its pres-\nence is required for optimal gene expression. The lacoperon is\ntherefore controlled by two distinct, ligand-modulated DNA-\nbinding trans -factors; one that acts positively (cAMP-CRP\ncomplex) to facilitate productive binding of RNA polymerase\nto the promoter and one that acts negatively (LacI repressor)\nthat antagonizes RNA polymerase promoter binding. Maximal\nactivity of the lacoperon occurs when glucose levels are low\n(high cAMP with CAP activation) and lactose is present\n(LacI is prevented from binding to the operator) as shown in\nFigure 38\u20133, panel C.\nWith the above information in hand, it becomes relatively\nto predict the effects of mutations in various components of\nthelac-system upon lacoperon expression. When the lacI\ngene has been mutated so that its product, LacI, is not capable\nof binding to operator DNA, the organism will exhibit con-\nstitutive expression of the lacoperon. In a contrary manner,\nan organism with a lacIgene mutation that produces a LacI\nprotein which prevents the binding of lactose or other small\nmolecule inducer to the repressor will remain repressed even\nin the presence of the inducer molecule, because such ligands\ncannot bind to the repressor on the operator locus in order to\nderepress the operon. Similarly, bacteria harboring mutations\nin their lacoperator locus such that the operator sequence\nwill not bind a normal repressor molecule will constitutively\nexpress the lacoperon genes. Mechanisms of positive and\nnegative regulation comparable to those described here for\nthelacsystem have been observed in eukaryotic cells (see fol-\nlowing discussion).The Genetic Switch of Bacteriophage\nLambda \n(\u03bb) Provides Another Paradigm\nfor Understanding the Role of\nConditional Regulatory Protein-DNA\nInteractions in Transcriptional Control\nin Eukaryotic Cells\nLike some eukaryotic viruses (eg, herpes simplex virus and HIV),\ncertain \nbacterial viruses can either reside in a dormant state\nwithin the host chromosomes or can replicate within the bac-\nterium and eventually lead to lysis and killing of the bacterial\nhost. Some E. coli harbor such a \u201ctemperate\u201d virus, bacterio-\nphage lambda (\u03bb). When lambda infects an organism of that\nspecies, it injects its 48,490-bp, double-stranded, linear DNA\ngenome into the cell ( Figure 38\u20134 ). Depending on the nutri-\ntional state of the cell, the lambda DNA will either integrate into\nthe host genome ( lysogenic pathway ) and remain dormant\nuntil activated (see following discussion), or it will commence\nreplicating until it has made about 100 copies of complete,\nprotein-packaged virus, at which point it causes lysis of its host\n(lytic pathway ). The newly generated virus particles can then\ninfect other susceptible host cells. Poor growth conditions favor\nlysogeny while good growth conditions promote the lytic path-\nway of lambda growth.\nWhen integrated into the host genome in its dormant state,\nlambda will remain in that state until activated by exposure\nof its bacterial host to DNA-damaging agents. In response to\nsuch a noxious stimulus, the dormant bacteriophage becomes\n\u201cinduced\u201d and begins to transcribe and subsequently translate\nthose genes of its own genome that are necessary for its exci-\nsion from the host chromosome, its DNA replication, and the\nsynthesis of its protein coat and lysis enzymes. This event acts\nlike a trigger or type C (see Figure 38\u20131) response; that is, once\ndormant lambda has committed itself to induction, there is no\nturning back until the cell is lysed and the replicated bacte-\nriophage released. This switch from a dormant or prophage\nstate to alytic infection is well understood at the genetic and\nmolecular levels and will be described in detail here; though\nless well understood at the molecular level, HIV and herpes\nviruses can behave similarly, transitioning from dormant to\nactive states in infected humans.\nThe lytic/lysogenic genetic switching event in lambda is\ncentered around an 80-bp region in its double-stranded DNA\ngenome referred to as the \u201cright operator\u201d (OR) (Figure 38\u20135A ).\nThe right operator is flanked on its left side by the gene for\nthe lambda repressor protein, cI, and on its right side by the\ngene encoding another regulatory protein, the crogene. When\nlambda is in its prophage state\u2014that is, integrated into the\nhost genome\u2014the cIrepressor gene is the only lambda gene\nthat is expressed. When the bacteriophage is undergoing\nlytic growth, the cIrepressor gene is not expressed, but the\ncrogene\u2014as well as many other lambda genes\u2014is expressed.\nThus, when the cIrepressor gene is on, the crogene is off, and\nwhen the crogene is on, the cIrepressor gene is off.

This decision between repressor gene transcrip-\ntion and crogene transcription is a paradigmatic example of a\nmolecular transcriptional switch.The 80-bp lambda right operator, OR, can be subdivided\ninto \nthree discrete, evenly spaced, 17-bp cis-active DNA ele-\nments that represent the binding sites for either of two bac-\nteriophage lambda regulatory proteins. Importantly, the\nnucleotide sequences of these three tandemly arranged sites are\nsimilar but not identical ( Figure 38\u20135B ). The three related cis-\nelements, termed operators OR1, OR2, and OR3, can be bound\nby\n either cI or cro proteins. However, the relative affinities of cI\nand cro for each of the sites vary, and this differential binding\naffinity is central to the appropriate operation of the lambda\nphage lytic or lysogenic \u201cmolecular switch. \u201d The DNA region\nbetween the croand repressor genes also contains two pro-\nmoter sequences that direct the binding of RNA polymerase\nin a specified orientation, where it commences transcribing\nadjacent genes. One promoter directs RNA polymerase to\ntranscribe in the rightward direction and, thus, to transcribe\ncroand other distal genes, while the other promoter directs the\ntranscription of the cIrepressor gene in the leftward direction\n(see Figure 38\u20135B).\nThe product of the cIrepressor gene, the 236-amino-acid\n\u03bb cI repressor protein is atwo-domain molecule with amino\nterminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) andcarboxyl-terminal\ndimerization domain . Association of one repressor protein\nwith another forms a dimer. cI repressor dimers bind to opera-\ntor DNA much more tightly than do monomers ( Figure 38\u20136A\nto38\u20136C ).\nThe product of the crogene, the 66-amino-acid, 9-kDa cro\nprotein , has a single domain but also binds the operator DNA\nmore tightly as a dimer ( Figure 38\u20136D ). The cro protein\u2019s single\ndomain mediates both operator binding and dimerization.\nIn a lysogenic bacterium\u2014that is, a bacterium contain-\ning an integrated, dormant lambda prophage\u2014the lambda\nrepressor dimer binds preferentially to OR1 but in so doing,\nby \na cooperative interaction, enhances the binding (by a factor\nof 10) of another repressor dimer to OR2 (Figure 38\u20137 ). The\naffinity of repressor for OR3 is the least of the three operator\nsubr\negions. The binding of repressor to OR1 has two major\neffects. \nFirst, occupancy of OR1 by repressor blocks the bind-\ning \nof RNA polymerase to the rightward promoter and in\nthat way prevents expression of cro.Second, as mentioned\nearlier, repressor dimer bound to OR1 enhances the binding\nof \nrepressor dimer to OR2. The binding of repressor to OR2\nhas \nthe important added effect of enhancing the binding of\nRNA polymerase to the leftward promoter that overlaps OR3\nand \nthereby enhances transcription and subsequent expres-\nsion of the repressor gene. This enhancement of transcrip-\ntion is mediated through direct protein\u2013protein interactions\nbetween promoter-bound RNA polymerase and OR2-bound\nrepr\nessor, much as described earlier for CAP protein and RNA\npolymerase on the lacoperon. Thus, the \u03bb cI protein is both\na negative regulator, by preventing transcription of cro, and a\npositive regulator, by enhancing transcription of its own gene,\ncI. This dual effect of repressor is responsible for the stable\nstate of the dormant lambda bacteriophage; not only does the\nrepressor prevent expression of the genes necessary for lysis,\nbut it also promotes expression of itself to stabilize this state1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n 10Lysogenic\npathwayLytic\npathway\n7\n9Ultraviolet\nradiation\n86\nInduction\nFIGURE 38\u20134 Alternate lytic and lysogenic lifestyles of\nbacteriophage \nlambda.

When cro repressor concen\ntration becomes quite high,\nit will eventually occupy OR1 and in so doing reduce the\nexpressio\nn of its own gene, a process that is necessary in order\nto drive transcription of the genes needed for the final stages\nof the lytic cycle.\nThe three-dimensional structures of cro and of the \u03bb cI\nrepressor protein have been determined by x-ray crystallography,\nand models for their binding and driving the above-described\nmolecular and genetic events have been formulated and tested.\nBoth bind DNA using helix-turn-helix DBD motifs (see follow-\ning discussion). Along with regulation of the expression of the\nlacoperon, the \u03bb molecular switch described here provides argu-\nably the best understanding of the molecular events involved in\ngene transcription activation and repression.\nDetailed analysis of the \u03bb repressor led to the important\nconcept that transcription regulatory proteins have several\nfunctional domains. For example, lambda repressor binds to\nDNA with high affinity. Repressor monomers form dimers\nthat cooperatively interact with each other, these proteins can\ninteract with RNA polymerase, to enhance or block promoter\nbinding or RNAP open complex formation (see Figure 36\u20133).\nThe protein-DNA interface and the three protein\u2013protein\ninterfaces all involve separate and distinct domains of the two\nmolecules. As will be noted later (see Figure 38\u201319), this is a\ncharacteristic that is typical of most molecules that regulate\ntranscription.\nSPECIAL FEATURES ARE\nINVOL\nVED IN REGULATION\nOF EUKARYOTIC GENE\nTRANSCRIPTION\nMost of the DNA in prokaryotic cells is organized into genes,\nand \nsince the DNA is not compacted with nucleosomal his-\ntones bacterial genomes have the potential to be transcribed if\nappropriate positive and negative trans -factors are present in\na given cell in an active form. A very different situation exists\nin eukaryotic cells for two major reasons: first, in human cells\nrelatively little of the total DNA is organized into mRNA-\nencoding genes and their associated regulatory regions. The\nfunction of the extra DNA is being actively investigated (ie,\nChapter 39; the ENCODE Projects). Secondly, as described in\nChapter 35, the DNA in eukaryotic cells is extensively folded\nand packed into the protein-DNA complex called chromatin.\nHistones are an important part of this complex since they both\nform the structures known as nucleosomes (see Chapter 35)\nand also factor significantly into gene regulatory mechanisms\nas outlined in following discussion.\nThe Chromatin Template Contributes\nImportantly \nto Eukaryotic Gene\nTranscription Control\nChromatin structure provides an additional level of control of\ngene\n transcription. As discussed in Chapter 35, large regions ofchromatin are transcriptionally inactive while others are either\nactive or potentially active. With few exceptions, each cell con-\ntains the same complement of genes; hence, the development\nof specialized organs, tissues, and cells, and their function in\nthe intact organism depend on the differential expression\nof genes.\nSome of this differential expression is achieved by having\ndifferent regions of chromatin available for transcription in\ncells from various tissues. For example, the DNA containing the\n\u03b2-globin gene cluster is in \u201cactive\u201d chromatin in the reticulo-\ncyte but in \u201cinactive\u201d chromatin in muscle cells. All the fac-\ntors involved in the determination of active chromatin have not\nbeen elucidated. The presence of nucleosomes and of complexes\nof histones and DNA (see Chapter 35) certainly provides a bar-\nrier against the ready association of most transcription factors\nwith specific DNA regions. The dynamics of the formation and\ndisruption of nucleosome structure are therefore an important\npart of eukaryotic gene regulation.\nHistone covalent modification, also dubbed the histone\ncode , is an important determinant of gene activity. Histones\nare subjected to a wide range of specific posttranslational\nmodifications (see Table 35\u20131). These modifications are\ndynamic and reversible. Histone acetylation and deacetylation\nare best understood. The surprising discovery that histone\nacetylase and other enzymatic activities are associated with the\ncoregulators involved in regulation of gene transcription (see\nChapter 42 for specific examples) has provided a new concept\nof gene regulation. Acetylation is known to occur on lysine\nresidues in the amino terminal tails of histone molecules,\nand has been consistently correlated with either active tran-\nscription, or alternatively, transcriptional potential. Histone\nacetylation reduces the positive charge of these tails and likely\ncontributes to a decrease in the binding affinity of histones\nfor the negatively charged DNA. Moreover, such covalent\nmodification of the histones creates new binding, or docking\nsites for additional proteins such as ATP-dependent chroma-\ntin remodeling complexes that contain subunits that carry\nstructural domains that specifically bind to histones that have\nbeen subjected to coregulator-deposited PTMs. These com-\nplexes can increase accessibility of adjacent DNA sequences\nby removing or otherwise altering nucleosomal histones.\nTogether then coregulators (chromatin modifiers and chro-\nmatin remodelers), working in conjunction, can \u201copen up\u201d\ngene promoters and regulatory regions, facilitating binding of\nother trans -factors such as transcriptional activator proteins,\nRNA polymerase II and the GTFs (see Figures 36\u201310 and\n36\u201311). Histone deacetylation catalyzed by transcriptional\ncorepressors would have the opposite effect. Different proteins\nwith specific acetylase and deacetylase activities are associated\nwith various components of the transcription apparatus. The\nproteins that catalyze histone PTMs are sometimes referred to\nas\u201ccode writers\u201d while the proteins that recognize, bind, and\nthus interpret these histone PTMs are termed \u201ccode readers\u201d\nwhile the enzymes that remove histone PTMs are called \u201ccode\nerasers .\u201d(The analogy to signal transduction, with its kinases,\nphosphatases, and phospho-amino acid binding proteins should"

Collectively then, histone\nPTMs repr\nesent a very dynamic, potentially information-rich\nsource of regulatory information. The exact rules and mecha-\nnisms defining the specificity of these various processes are\nunder investigation. Some specific examples are illustrated in\nChapter 42. A variety of commercial enterprises are working\nto develop drugs that specifically alter the activity of the pro-\nteins that orchestrate the presence and composition of the his-\ntone code, whose relevant PTMs continue to grow at a rapid\npace (compare Table 38\u20132 with Table 35\u20131).\nIn addition to the histone code and its effects on all\nDNA-mediated reactions, the methylation of deoxycyti-\ndine residues, 5meC, (in the sequence 5 \u2032-meCpG-3 \u2032) in DNA\nhas important effects on chromatin, some of which lead to a\ndecrease in gene transcription. For example, in mouse liver,\nonly the unmethylated ribosomal RNA encoding genes can be\nexpressed, and there is evidence that many animal viruses are\nnot transcribed when their DNA is methylated. Acute demeth-\nylation of 5meC residues in specific regions of steroid hormone\ninducible \ngenes has been associated with an increased rate\nof transcription of the gene. However, as with many histone\nPTMs, it is not yet possible to generalize that methylated DNAis transcriptionally inactive, that all inactive chromatin is\nmethylated, or that active DNA is not methylated.\nFinally, the binding of specific transcription factors to\ncognate DNA elements may result in disruption of nucleoso-\nmal structure. Most eukaryotic genes have multiple protein-\nbinding DNA elements. The serial binding of transcription\nfactors to these elements\u2014in a combinatorial fashion\u2014may\neither directly disrupt the structure of the nucleosome, pre-\nvent its reformation, or recruit, via protein\u2013protein interac-\ntions, multiprotein coregulator complexes that have the ability\nto covalently modify and/or remodel nucleosomes. These\nreactions result in chromatin-level structural changes that in\nthe end increase or decrease DNA accessibility to other factors\nand the transcription machinery.\nEukaryotic DNA that is in an \u201cactive\u201d region of chroma-\ntin can be transcribed. As in prokaryotic cells, a promoter\ndictates where the RNA polymerase will initiate transcrip-\ntion, but the promoter in mammalian cells (see Chapter 36)\nis more complex. Additional complexity is added by elements\nor factors that enhance or repress transcription, define tissue-\nspecific expression, and modulate the actions of many effector\nmolecules. Finally, recent results suggest that gene activation\nTABLE 38\u20132 Summary of Novel Histone PTMs (2011 to 2020)\nHistone PTM Reaction Donor Precursor Writer Eraser FunctionPhysiological\nRelevance\nGlutarylation Acylation Glutarate Kat2a,\nintramolecular\ncatalysisSirt7 Nucleosome\ndestabilization,\npermissive\ntranscriptionGlutaric acidemia\nLactylation Acylation Lactate p300 Permissive\ntranscriptionMacrophage response,\nhypoxia\nBenzoylation Acylation Benzoate Sirt2 Permissive\ntranscriptionSodium benzoate\ntreatment\nS-palmitoylation S-acylation Palmitic acid Cell signaling\nO-palmitoylation O-acylation Palmitic acid Lpcat1 Reduced\ntranscriptionCell signaling\nSerotonylation Transamidation Serotonin Tgm2 Permissive\ntranscriptionNeuronal differentiation\nDopaminylation Transmidation Dopamine Tgm2 Altered\ntranscriptionDrug-seeking behaviors\n5-Hydroxylysine Hydroxylation 2-Oxoglutarate Jmjd6 Testes, development\nGlycation Maillard Methylglyoxal,\nmonosaccharidesNonenzymatic DJ-1 Altered nucleosome\nstabilityBreast cancer,\nhyperglycemia\n4-Oxononanoylation Ketoamide\nadduction4-Oxo-2-nonenal Nonenzymatic Sirt2 Nucleosome\ndestabilizationLipid peroxidation\nAcrolein adduct Michael\nadditionAcrolein Nonenzymatic Nucleosome\ndestabilizationCigarette smoke, lipid\nperoxidation\nS-glutathionylation Disulfide\nformationGlutathione Nonenzymatic Nucleosome\ndestabilizationAging\nHomocysteinylation Thiolation Homocysteine\nthyolactoneNonenzymatic Reduced\ntranscriptionHyperhomocysteinemia\nModified with permission from Chan JC, Maze I.

Indeed, in\nrecent years the role of covalent modification of DNA and\nhistone (and nonhistone) proteins and the newly discovered\nncRNAs has received tremendous attention in the field of gene\nregulation research, particularly through investigation into\nhow such chemical modifications and/or molecules stably alter\ngene expression patterns without altering the underlying DNAgene sequence. This field of study has been termed epigenetics .\nAs mentioned in Chapter 35, one aspect of these mechanisms,\nPTMs of histones has been dubbed the histone code or histone\nepigenetic code. The term \u201cepigenetics\u201d means \u201cabove genetics\u201d\nand refers to the fact that these regulatory mechanisms do not\nchange the underlying regulated DNA sequence, but rather\nsimply the expression patterns, or function, of this DNA.\nEpigenetic mechanisms play key roles in the establishment,\nmaintenance, and reversibility of transcriptional states. A key\nfeature of epigenetic mechanisms is that the controlled tran-\nscriptional on/off states can be maintained through multiple\nrounds of cell division. This observation indicates that there\nmust be robust, biochemically based mechanisms to maintain\nand stably propagate these epigenetic states.\nTwo forms of epigenetic signals ,cis- and trans -epigenetic\nsignals , can be described; these are schematically illustrated\ninFigure 38\u20138 .

A DNA-binding transactivator\nprotein (yellow circle) is transcribed from its cognate gene (yellow bar) located on a particular chromosome (blue). The expressed protein is freely\ndiffusible between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Note that excess transactivator reenters the nucleus following cell division, binds\nto its own gene, and activates transcription in both daughter cells. This cycle re-establishes the positive feedback loop that was in effect prior to\ncell division, and thereby enforces stable expression of this transcriptional activator protein in both cells. ( B) Acis-epigenetic signal; a gene (pink)\nlocated on a particular chromosome (blue) carries a cis-epigenetic signal (small yellow flag) within the regulatory region upstream of the pink\ngene transcription unit. In this case, the epigenetic signal is associated with active gene transcription and subsequent gene product production\n(pink circles). During DNA replication, the newly replicated chromatid serves as a template that both elicits, and templates, the introduction of\nthe same epigenetic signal, or mark, on the newly synthesized, unmarked chromatid. Consequently, both daughter cells contain the pink gene in\na similarly cis-epigenetically marked state, which ensures expression in an identical fashion in both cells. See text for more detail."

Thus, the original 5meC methylation mark\nultimate\nly results in both DNA daughter strands having the\ncomplete cis-epigenetic mark.\nBoth cis- and trans -epigenetic signals can result in stable and\nhereditable expression states, and therefore generally represent\ntype C gene expression responses (ie, Figure 38\u20131). However,\nit is important to note that both states can be reversed if either\nthetrans - orcis-epigenetic signals are removed by, for example,\nextinguishing the expression of the enforcing transcription factor\n(trans -signal) or by completely removing a DNA cis-epigenetic\nsignal (via DNA demethylation).

The first example of epi-\ngenetic mark transmission involves the propagation of DNA\n5meC marks, and occurs as described in Figure 38\u20138. The\nse\ncond example of epigenetic state transmission illustrates\nhow a nucleosomal histone PTM (in this example, Lysine K-27\ntrimethylated histone H3; H3K27me3) can be propagated. In\nthis example immediately following DNA replication, both\nH3K27me3-marked and H3-unmarked nucleosomes ran-\ndomly reform on both daughter DNA strands. The polycomb\nrepressive complex 2 (PRC2) , composed of EED-SUZ12-\nEZH2 and RbAP subunits, binds to the nucleosome contain-\ning the preexisting H3K27me3 mark via the EED subunit.\nBinding of PRC2 to this histone mark stimulates the methyl-\nase activity of the EZH2 subunit of PRC2, which results in the\nlocal methylation of nucleosomal H3. Histone H3 methyla-\ntion thus causes the full, stable transmission of the H3K27me3\nepigenetic mark to both chromatids. Finally, locus/sequence-\nspecific targeting of nucleosomal histone epigenetic cis-signals\ncan be attained through the action of lncRNAs as depicted in\nFigure 38\u20139, panel C.

Enhancers can exert their positive influence\non transcription even when separated by tens of thousands of\nbase pairs from a promoter; enhancers work when oriented\nin either direction; and enhancers can work upstream (5 \u2032) or\ndownstream (3 \u2032) from the promoter, or even when embedded\nwithin the transcription unit of a gene. Experimentally, enhanc-\ners can be shown to be promiscuous, in that they can stimulate\ntranscription of any promoter in their vicinity, and may act on\nmore than one promoter. The viral SV40 enhancer can exert\nan influence on, for example, the transcription of \u03b2-globin by\nincreasing its transcription 200-fold in cells containing boththe SV40 enhancer and the \u03b2-globin gene on the same plasmid\n(see following discussion and Figure 38\u201310 ); in this case the\nSV40 enhancer-\u03b2-globin reporter gene was constructed using\nrecombinant DNA technology\u2014see Chapter 39. The enhancer\nelement does not produce a product that in turn acts on the\npromoter, since it is active only when it exists within the same\nDNA molecule as the promoter (ie, in cis, or physically linked to).\nEnhancer-binding proteins are responsible for this effect. The\nexact mechanism(s) by which these transcription activators\nwork is subject to intensive investigation. Enhancer-binding\ntrans -factors, some of which are cell-type specific, while oth-\ners are ubiquitously expressed, have been shown to interact\nFIGURE 38\u201310 A schematic illustrating the methods used\nto \nstudy the organization and action of enhancers and other cis-\nacting regulatory elements. These model chimeric genes, all con-\nstructed by recombinant DNA techniques in vitro (see Chapter 39),\nconsist of a reporter gene that encodes a protein that can be readily\nassayed, and that is not normally produced in the cells to be studied,\na promoter that ensures accurate initiation of transcription, and the\nindicated enhancer (regulatory response) elements. In all cases, high-\nlevel transcription from the indicated chimeras depends on the pres-\nence of enhancers, which stimulate transcription \u2265100-fold over basal\ntranscriptional levels (ie, transcription of the same chimeric genes\ncontaining just promoters fused to the indicated reporter genes).\nExamples ( A) and ( B) illustrate the fact that enhancers (eg, here SV40)\nwork in either orientation and upon a heterologous promoter. Exam-\nple (C) illustrates that the metallothionein (mt) regulatory element\n(which under the influence of cadmium or zinc induces transcription\nof the endogenous mtgene and hence the metal-binding mt protein)\nwill work through the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase\n(tk) gene promoter to enhance transcription of the human growth\nhormone ( hGH) reporter gene.

The fourth factor is the ubiquitous,\nabundant architectural transcription factor known as HMG\nI(Y). Upon binding to its A + T-rich binding sites, HMG I(Y)\ninduces a significant bend in the DNA. There are four such\nHMG I(Y) binding sites interspersed throughout the enhancer.\nIt is believed that these sites play a key role in facilitating theformation of a unique 3D structure in concert with the afore-\nmentioned three trans -factors, by inducing a series of criti-\ncally spaced DNA bends. Consequently, HMG I(Y) likely\ninduces the cooperative formation of a unique, stereospecific\nstructure within which all four factors are active when viral\ninfection signals are sensed by the cell. The putative structure\nformed by the cooperative assembly of these four factors has\nbeen termed the \u03b2-interferon enhanceosome ( Figure 38\u201311 ),\nFIGURE 38\u201311 Formation and putative structure of the\nenha\nnceosome formed on the human \u03b2-interferon gene enhancer.\nDiagrammatically represented at the top is the distribution of the\nmultiple cis-elements (HMG, PRDIV, PRDI-III, PRDII, NRDI) composing\nthe \u03b2-interferon gene enhancer. The intact enhancer mediates tran-\nscriptional induction of the \u03b2-interferon gene ( IFNB1 ) over 100-fold\nupon virus infection of human cells. The cis-elements of this modular\nenhancer represent the binding sites for the trans -factors HMG I(Y),\ncJun-ATF-2, IRF3-IRF7, and NF-\u03baB, respectively. The factors interact with\nthese DNA elements in an obligatory, ordered, and highly coopera-\ntive fashion as indicated by the arrow. Initial binding of four HMG I(Y)\nproteins induces sharp DNA bends in the enhancer, causing the entire\n70- to 80-bp region to assume a high level of curvature. This curvature\nis integral to the subsequent highly cooperative binding of the other\ntrans -factors since bending enables the DNA-bound factors to make\ncritical direct protein\u2013protein interactions that both contribute to the\nformation and stability of the enhanceosome and generate a unique\n3D surface that serves to recruit chromatin-modifying coregulators that\ncarry enzymatic activities (eg, Swi/Snf: ATPase, chromatin remodeler\nand P/CAF: histone acetyltransferase) as well as the general transcrip-\ntion machinery (RNA polymerase II and GTFs). Although four of the five\ncis-elements (PRDIV, PRDI-III, PRDII, NRDI) independently can modestly\nstimulate (~10-fold) transcription of a reporter gene in transfected\ncells (see Figures 38\u201310 and 38\u201312), all five cis-elements, in appropriate\norder, are required to form an enhancer that can appropriately stimu-\nlate transcription of IFNB1 (ie, \u2265100-fold) in response to viral infection of\na human cell. This distinction indicates a strict requirement for appro-\npriate enhanceosome architecture for efficient trans -activation. Similar\nenhanceosomes, involving distinct cis- and trans -factors and coregula-\ntors, are proposed to form on many other mammalian genes.TABLE 38\u20133 Summary of the Properties of Enhancers\n\u2022W ork when located both short and long distances from target\npromoter\n\u2022Work when upstream or downstream from the promoter\n\u2022Work when oriented in either direction\n\u2022Work when embedded within target promoter\n\u2022Can work with homologous or heterologous promoters\n\u2022Work by binding one or more proteins\n\u2022Can be composed of one to a few binding elements or many mul-\ntiples of activation elements (super enhancers)\n\u2022Work by recruiting chromatin-modifying coregulatory complexes\n\u2022Work by facilitating binding and/or function of the basal transcrip-\ntion complex at the cis-linked promoter"

The enhanceosome,\nonce formed, induces a large increase in \u03b2-interferon gene\ntranscription upon virus infection. Thus, it is thought that it is\nnot simply the protein occupancy of the linearly apposed cis-\nelement sites that induces \u03b2-interferon gene transcription\u2014\nrather, it is the formation of the enhanceosome proper that\nprovides appropriate surfaces and 3-dimensional organization\nfor the efficient recruitment of coactivators that results in the\nenhanced formation of the PIC on the cis-linked promoter and\nthus transcription activation.\ncis-Acting DNA elements that decrease the expression of\nspecific genes are termed silencers . Silencers have also been\nidentified in a number of eukaryotic genes. However, because\nfewer of these elements have been intensively studied, it is\nnot possible to formulate accurate generalizations about their\nmechanism of action. That said, it is clear that as for gene acti-\nvation, chromatin level covalent modifications of histones,\nand other proteins, by silencer-recruited repressors and co-\nrecruited multisubunit corepressors likely play central roles in\nthese regulatory events.\nTissue-Specific Expression May Result\nFrom \nEither the Action of Enhancers or\nRepressors, or a Combination of Both\ncis-Acting Regulatory Elements\nMost genes are now recognized to harbor enhancer elements\nin \nvarious locations relative to their coding regions. In addi-\ntion to being able to enhance gene transcription, some of these\nenhancer elements clearly possess the ability to do so in a\ntissue-specific manner. By fusing known or suspected tissue-\nspecific enhancers or silencers to reporter genes (see following\ndiscussion) and introducing these chimeric enhancer-reporter\nconstructs via microinjection into single-cell embryos, one\ncan create a transgenic animal (see Chapter 39), and rigorously\ntest whether a given test enhancer or silencer truly modulates\nexpression in a cell- or tissue-specific fashion. This transgenic\nanimal approach has proved useful in studying tissue-specific\ngene expression.\nReporter Genes Are Used to Define\nEnhancers \n& Other Regulatory\nElements That Modulate Gene\nExpression\nBy ligating regions of DNA suspected of harboring regulatory\nsequences \nto various reporter genes (the reporter orchime-\nric gene approach) (Figures 38\u201310 ,38\u201312 , and 38\u201313 ), one\ncan determine which regions in the vicinity of structural genes\nhave an influence on their expression. Pieces of DNA thought\nto harbor regulatory elements, often identified by bioinfor-\nmatic sequence alignments, are ligated to a suitable reportergene and introduced into a host cell (see Figure 38\u201312).\nExpression of the reporter gene will be increased if the DNA\ncontains a particular enhancer. For example, addition of dif-\nferent hormones to separate cultures will increase expression\nof the reporter gene if the DNA contains a particular hormone\nresponse DNA element (HRE ) (see Figure 38\u201313; see also\nChapter 42). The location of the element can be pinpointed by\nusing progressively shorter pieces of DNA, deletions, or and/\nor point mutations (see Figure 38\u201313).FIGURE 38\u201312 The use of reporter genes to define DNA reg-\nulatory \nelements.

As noted in Figure 38\u201310 in such experiments, the reporter cannot\nbe present endogenously in the cells transfected. Consequently, any\ndetection of these activities in a cell extract means that the cell was\nsuccessfully transfected by the plasmid. Not shown here, but typically\none cotransfects an additional reporter such as Renilla luciferase to\nserve as a transfection efficiency control. Assay conditions for the firefly\nandRenilla luciferases are different, hence the two activities can be\nindependently sequentially assayed using the same cell extract. An\nincrease of firefly luciferase activity over the basal level, for example,\nafter addition of one or more hormones, means that the region of\nDNA inserted into the reporter gene plasmid contains functional\nhormone response elements (HRE). Progressively shorter pieces of\nDNA, regions with internal deletions, or regions with point mutations\ncan be constructed and inserted upstream of the reporter gene to\npinpoint the response element (Figure 38\u201313). One caveat of this\napproach is that the transfected plasmid DNAs likely do not form\n\u201cclassical\u201d chromatin structures."

The activity of a\ngene at any moment reflects the interaction of these numerous\ncis-acting DNA elements with their respective trans -acting\nfactors. Overall, transcriptional output is determined by the\nbalance of positive and negative signaling to the transcrip-\ntion machinery. The challenge now is to figure out exactly\nhow this regulation occurs at the molecular level so that we\nmight ultimately have the ability to modulate gene transcrip-\ntion therapeutically.\nCombinations of DNA Elements &\nAssociated \nProteins Provide Diversity\nin Responses\nProkaryotic genes are often regulated in an on-off manner\nin \nresponse to simple environmental cues. Some eukary-\notic genes are regulated in the simple on-off manner, but\nthe process in most genes, especially in mammals, is much\nmore complicated. Signals representing a number of complex\nenvironmental stimuli may converge on a single gene. The\nresponse of the gene to these signals can have several physi-\nologic characteristics. First, the response may extend over a\nconsiderable range. This is accomplished by having additive\nand synergistic positive responses counterbalanced by nega-\ntive or repressing effects. In some cases, either the positive\nor the negative response can be dominant. Also required is a\nmechanism whereby an effector, such as a hormone, can acti-\nvate some genes in a cell while repressing others and leavingstill others unaffected. When all of these processes are coupled\nwith tissue-specific element factors, considerable flexibility\nis afforded. These physiologic variables obviously require an\narrangement much more complicated than an on-off switch.\nThe collection and organization of DNA elements in a pro-\nmoter specifies\u2014via associated factors\u2014how a given gene will\nrespond, and how long a particular response is maintained.\nSome simple examples are illustrated in Figure 38\u201314 .\nTranscription Domains Can Be\nDefined \nby Variable 3-D Localization\nWithin the Cell\nThe large number of genes in eukaryotic cells and the complex\narrays \nof transcription regulatory factors present an organiza-\ntional problem. Why are some genes available for transcrip-\ntion in a given cell whereas others are not? If enhancers can\nregulate several genes from tens of kilobase distances and are\nnot obligatorily position- and orientation-dependent, how are\nthey prevented from triggering transcription of all cis-linked\ngenes in the vicinity? Part of the solution to these problems\nis arrived at by having the chromatin arranged in functional\nunits that restrict patterns of gene expression.

On a gene-by-gene scale, a molecular\nmechanism to focus enhancer-driven transcription is pro-\nvided by insulators . These DNA elements, also in associa-\ntion with one or more specific proteins, prevent an enhancer\nfrom acting on a promoter on the other side of an insulator in\nanother transcription domain. Insulators thus serve as tran-\nscriptional boundary elements . In the globin gene cluster,\nand many other genes, enhancer and promoter sequences are\nbrought into physical contact via specific DNA looping events,\noften involving boundary elements. The rules controlling such\nchromosome looping are currently under intense study.\nSEVERAL STRUCTURAL MOTIFS\nC\nOMPOSE THE DNA-BINDING\nDOMAINS OF REGULATORY\nTRANSCRIPTION FACTOR\nPROTEINS\nThe specificity involved in the control of transcription requires\nthat \nregulatory proteins bind with high affinity and specific-\nity to the correct region of DNA. Three unique motifs\u2014the\nhelix-turn-helix (HTH) , thezinc finger (ZF), and the leucine\nzipper (LZ) \u2014account for many of these specific protein-DNA\ninteractions. Examples of proteins containing these motifs are\ngiven in Table 38\u20134 .\nComparison of the binding activities of the proteins that\ncontain these motifs leads to several important generalizations.\n1.Binding must be of high affinity to the specific site, and of\nlow affinity to all other DNA.\n2.Small regions of the protein make direct contact with\nDNA; the rest of the protein, in addition to providing thetrans -activation domains, may be involved in the dimer-\nization of monomers of the binding protein, may provide\na contact surface for the formation of heterodimers, may\nprovide one or more ligand-binding sites, or may provide\nsurfaces for interaction with coactivators, corepressors, or\nthe transcription machinery.\n3.The protein-DNA interactions made by these proteins are\nmaintained by hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and van\nder Waals forces.\n4.The motifs found in these proteins are class-specific; their\npresence in a protein of unknown function suggests that the\nprotein may bind to DNA.\n5.Proteins with the helix-turn-helix or leucine zipper motifs\nform dimers, and their respective DNA-binding sites are\nsymmetric palindromes. In proteins with the zinc finger\nmotif, the binding site is repeated two to nine times. These\nfeatures allow for cooperative interactions between binding\nsites and enhance the degree and affinity of binding.\nThe Helix-Turn-Helix Motif\nThe first motif described was the helix-turn-helix . Analysis\nof the 3D structure of the lambda cro transcription regula-\ntor revealed that each monomer consists of three antiparallel\n\u03b2 sheets and three \u03b1 helices ( Figure 38\u201315 ). The dimer forms\nby association of the antiparallel \u03b23sheets. The \u03b13helices form\nthe DNA recognition surface, and the rest of the molecule\nappears to be involved in stabilizing these structures. The\naverage diameter of an \u03b1 helix is 1.2 nm, which is the approxi-\nmate width of the major groove in the B form of DNA.\nThe DNA recognition domain of each cro monomer inter-\nacts with 5 bp and the dimer-binding sites span 3.4 nm, allow-\ning it to fit into successive half turns of the major groove on the\nsame surface of DNA (see Figure 38\u201315). X-ray analyses of the\n\u03bb cI repressor, CAP (the cAMP receptor protein of E. coli ), tryp-\ntophan repressor, and phage 434 repressor, all also display this\ndimeric helix-turn-helix structure, which is also present in many\neukaryotic DNA-binding proteins (see Table 38\u20134).\nThe Zinc Finger Motif\nThe zinc finger was the second DNA-binding motif whose\natomic structure was elucidated. It was known that the\neukaryotic protein involved, a positive regulator of 5S RNA\ngene transcription termed TFIIIA, required zinc for activity.\nStructural and biophysical analyses revealed that each TFIIIA\nmolecule contains nine zinc ions in a repeating coordination\ncomplex formed by closely spaced cysteine\u2013cysteine residues\nfollowed 12 to 13 amino acids later by a histidine\u2013histidine\npair ( Figure 38\u201316 ). In some instances\u2014notably the steroid\u2013\nthyroid nuclear hormone receptor family\u2014the His\u2013His dou-\nblet is replaced by a second Cys\u2013Cys pair. The zinc finger\nmotifs of the protein lie on one face of the DNA helix, with\nsuccessive fingers alternatively positioned in one turn in the\nmajor groove.

The critical tests to address\nthis question was first performed in the yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae .\nThe yeast GAL1 gene is a member of a group of genes\ninvolved in galactose metabolism. Transcription of GAL1 is\ncontrolled by the DNA-binding transactivator protein Gal4.\nGal4 binds to a 17bp enhancer element (termed upstream acti-\nvator sequence, or UAS in yeast) located upstream of the Gal1\npromoter via its N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD; Gal4\namino acids 1-73). Gal4 activates GAL1 transcription through\na C-terminal 34 aa activation domain (AD). To systematically\ntest the contributions of the Gal4 AD and DBD sequences to\nGAL1 gene transcription activation, and to ask whether the\nGal4 DBD uniquely contributed to such transcription activa-\ntion, a series of domain swap experiments were performed\n(Figure 38\u201318 ). The amino terminal 73-amino-acid DBD of\nGal4 was removed and replaced with the DBD of LexA, an\nE. coli DNA-binding protein. This domain swap resulted in a\nchimeric molecule (lexA DBD-Gal4 AD) that did not bind to\ntheGAL1 UAS , and did not activate transcription of the GAL1\ngene as might be expected (see Figure 38\u201318). If, however, the\nlexA operator\u2014the DNA sequence normally bound by the\nLexA DBD\u2014was inserted upstream of the promoter of the GAL\ngene to replace the normal GAL1 enhancer, the hybrid LexA-\nGal4 AD fusion protein bound to this chimeric gene (at the\nsubstituted lexA operator) and activated transcription of GAL1 .\nThis general experiment has been repeated many times with alarge array of different DBDs and ADs. Collectively, such data\ndemonstrates that the DBDs and ADs of many transcription\nfactors can function independently.\nThe hierarchy involved in assembling gene transcription-\nactivating complexes includes proteins that bind DNA and\ntransactivate; others that form protein\u2013protein complexes\nwhich bridge DNA-binding proteins to transactivating pro-\nteins; and others that form protein\u2013protein complexes with\ncomponents of coregulators or the basal transcription appa-\nratus. A given protein may thus have several modular surfaces\nor domains that serve different functions ( Figure 38\u201319 ).

These ~22 nucleotide RNAs regulate\nthe function/expression of specific mRNAs by either inhibit-\ning translation or inducing mRNA degradation via different\nmechanisms; in a very few cases miRNAs have been shown to\nstimulate mRNA function. miRNA action can result in dra-\nmatic changes in protein production and hence gene expres-\nsion. These small ncRNAs have been implicated in numerous\nhuman diseases such as heart disease, cancer, muscle wasting,\nviral infection, and diabetes.\nmiRNAs and siRNAs, like the DNA-binding transcription\nfactors described in detail earlier, are transactive, and once\nsynthesized and appropriately processed, interact with specific\nproteins and bind target mRNAs (see Figure 36\u201317). Binding\nof miRNAs to mRNA targets is directed by normal base-pairing\nrules. In general, if miRNA\u2013mRNA base pairing has one or\nmore mismatches, translation of the cognate \u201ctarget\u201d mRNA\nis inhibited, whereas if miRNA\u2013mRNA base pairing is perfect\nover all 22 nucleotides, the corresponding mRNA is degraded.\nGiven the tremendous and ever-growing importance of\nmiRNAs, many scientists and biotechnology companies are\nactively studying miRNA biogenesis, transport, and function\nin hopes of curing human disease. Time will tell the magni-\ntude and universality of ncRNA-mediated gene regulation.\nEukaryotic Genes Can Be Amplified or\nRearranged \nDuring Development or in\nResponse to Drugs\nDuring early development of metazoans, there is an abrupt\nincrease in \nthe need for specific molecules such as ribosomal\nRNA and messenger RNA molecules for proteins that make\nup specific cell or tissue types. One way to increase the rate at\nwhich such molecules can be formed is to increase the number\nof genes available for transcription of these specific molecules.\nAmong the repetitive DNA sequences within the genome are\nhundreds of copies of ribosomal RNA-encoding genes. These\ngenes preexist repetitively in the DNA of the gametes and\nthus are transmitted in high copy numbers from generation\nto generation. In some specific organisms such as the fruit\nfly (Drosophila ), there occurs during oogenesis an amplifica-\ntion of a few preexisting genes such as those for the chorion\n(eggshell) proteins. Subsequently, these amplified genes, pre-\nsumably generated by a process of repeated initiations during\nDNA synthesis, provide multiple sites for gene transcription\n(see Figures 36\u20134 and 38\u201320 ). The dark side of specific gene\namplification is the fact that in human cancer cells drug resis-\ntance can develop upon extended therapeutic treatment due to\nthe amplification and increased expression of genes that encode\nproteins that either degrade, or pump drugs from target cells.As noted in Chapter 36, the coding sequences responsible\nfor the generation of specific protein molecules are frequently\nnot contiguous in the mammalian genome. In the case of anti-\nbody encoding genes, this is particularly true. As described in\ndetail in Chapter 52, immunoglobulins are composed of two\npolypeptides, the so-called heavy (about 50 kDa) and light\n(about 25 kDa) chains. The mRNAs encoding these two protein\nsubunits are encoded by gene sequences that are subjected to\nextensive DNA sequence\u2013coding changes. These DNA coding\nchanges are integral to generating the requisite recognition\ndiversity central to appropriate immune function.\nIgG heavy- and light-chain mRNAs are encoded by sev-\neral different segments that are tandemly repeated in the\ngermline. Thus, for example, the IgG light chain consists of\nvariable (VL), joining (JL), and constant (CL) domains or seg-\nments. \nFor particular subsets of IgG light chains, there are\nroughly 300 tandemly repeated VLgene coding segments, 5\ntandemly arranged JLcoding sequences, and roughly 10 CL\ngene \ncoding segments. All of these multiple, distinct coding\nsequences are located in the same region of the same chro-\nmosome, and each type of coding segment (VL, JL, and CL) is\ntandemly repeat\ned in head-to-tail fashion within the segment\nrepeat region. By having multiple VL, JL, and CLsegments to\nchoose from, an immune cell has a greater repertoire of\nsequences to work with to develop both immunologic flex-\nibility and specificity. However, a given functional IgG light-\nchain transcription unit\u2014like all other \u201cnormal\u201d mammalian\ntranscription units\u2014contains only the coding sequences for\na single protein. Thus, before a particular IgG light chain can\nbe expressed, single VL, JL, and CLcoding sequences must be\nrecombined to generate a single , contiguous transcription unit\nexcluding the multiple nonutilized segments (ie, the other\napproximately 300 unused VLsegments, the other 4 unused JL\nsegments, a\nnd the other 9 unused CLsegments). This  deletion\nof unused genetic information is accomplished by selective\nDNA recombination that removes the unwanted coding DNA\nwhile retaining the required coding sequences: one VL, one JL,\nand \none CLsequence. (VLsequences are subjected to additional\npoint mutagenesis to generate even more variability\u2014hence\nthe name.)

These multiple IgG-gene recombi-\nnation and mutation events are generated in a single clonal\npopulation of B-cells. Although the IgG genes represent one\nof the best-studied instances of directed DNA rearrangement\nmodulating gene expression, other cases of gene regulatory\nDNA rearrangement have been described.\nAlternative RNA Processing Is Another\nContr\nol Mechanism\nIn addition to affecting the efficiency of promoter utilization,\neukaryotic cells \nemploy alternative RNA processing to control\ngene expression. This can result when alternative promoters,\nintron\u2013exon splice sites, or polyadenylation sites are used.\nOccasionally, heterogeneity within a cell results, but more\ncommonly the same primary transcript is processed differ-\nently in different tissues. A few examples of each of these types\nof regulation are presented later.\nThe use of alternative transcription start sites results in\na different 5 \u2032exon on mRNAs encoding mouse amylase and\nmyosin light chain, rat glucokinase, and Drosophila alcohol\ndehydrogenase and actin. Alternative polyadenylation sites in\nthe \u03bc immunoglobulin heavy-chain primary transcript result\nin mRNAs that are either 2700 bases long (\u03bcm) or 2400 bases\nlon\ng (\u03bcs). This results in a different carboxyl-terminal region of\nthe \nencoded proteins such that the \u03bcmpr otein remains attached\nto the membrane of the B lymphocyte and the \u03bcsim munoglobulin\nis secreted. Alternative splicing and processing results in the\nformation of seven unique \u03b1-tropomyosin mRNAs in seven\ndifferent tissues. It is not yet fully understood how these pro-\ncessing-splicing decisions are made or exactly how these steps\ncan be regulated.\nRegulation of Messenger RNA Stability\nProvides \nAnother Control Mechanism\nAlthough most mRNAs in mammalian cells are very stable\n(half-lives \nmeasured in hours), some turn over very rapidly\n(half-lives of 10-30 minutes). In certain instances, mRNA sta-\nbility is subject to regulation. This has important implicationssince there is usually a direct relationship between mRNA\namount and the translation of that mRNA into its cognate pro-\ntein. Changes in the stability of a specific mRNA can therefore\nhave major effects on biologic processes.\nMessenger RNAs exist in the cytoplasm as ribonucleo-\nprotein particles (RNPs) . Some of these proteins protect the\nmRNA from digestion by nucleases, while others may under\ncertain conditions promote nuclease attack. It is thought that\nmRNAs are stabilized or destabilized by the interaction of\nproteins with these various structures or sequences. Certain\neffectors, such as hormones, may regulate mRNA stability by\nincreasing or decreasing the amount of these mRNA-binding\nproteins.\nIt is known that the ends of mRNA molecules are involved\nin mRNA stability ( Figure 38\u201321 ). The 5 \u2032\u2013cap structure in\neukaryotic mRNA prevents attack by 5 \u2032exonucleases, and\nthe poly(A) tail minimizes the action of 3 \u2032exonucleases. In\nmRNA molecules with those structures, it is presumed that a\nsingle endonucleolytic cut allows exonucleases to attack and\ndigest the entire molecule. Other structures (sequences) in the\n5\u2032\u2013untranslated region (5 \u2032UTR), the coding region, and the 3 \u2032\nUTR are thought to promote or prevent this initial endonu-\ncleolytic action (see Figure 38\u201321).\nThus, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are used to\nregulate mRNA stability and hence function\u2014just as several\nmechanisms are used to regulate the synthesis of mRNA, and as\ndetailed in Chapter 37, mRNA translation. Coordinate regulation\nof these processes confers on the cell remarkable adaptability.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0The genetic constitutions of metazoan somatic cells are nearly\nall identical.\n\u25a0Phenotype (tissue or cell specificity) is dictated by differences\nin gen\ne expression of the cellular complement of genes.\n\u25a0Alterations in gene expression allow a cell to adapt to\nenviro\nnmental changes, developmental cues, and physiologic\nsignals.\n\u25a0Gene expression can be controlled at multiple levels by changes\nin tran\nscription, mRNA processing, localization, and stability\nor translation. Gene amplification and rearrangements also\ninfluence gene expression.FIGURE 38\u201321 Structure of a typical eukaryotic mRNA showing elements that are involved in regulating mRNA stability. The typi-\ncal eukaryotic mRNA has a 5 \u2032\u2013noncoding sequence (NCS), or untranslated exonic region (5 \u2032UTR), a coding region, and a 3 \u2032\u2013exonic untranslated\nNCS region (3 \u2032UTR). Essentially all mRNAs are capped at the 5 \u2032end, and most have a 100 to 200 nt polyadenylate sequence at their 3 \u2032end. The\n5\u2032cap and 3 \u2032poly(A) tail protect the mRNA against exonuclease attack and are bound by specific proteins that interact to facilitate translation\n(see Figure 37\u20137). Stem-loop structures in the 5 \u2032and 3 \u2032NCS, and the AU-rich region in the 3 \u2032NCS represent the binding sites for specific proteins\nthat modulate mRNA stability."

Collectively these powerful new technologies\nare having an increasing impact on clinical medicine. Although\nmuch has been learned about human genetic disease from\npedigree analysis and study of the affected, mutated proteins,\nin many cases where the specific genetic defect was unknown,\nthese approaches could not be used. Fortunately, these new\ntechnologies circumvent these limitations by going directly to\ncellular DNA, RNA, and protein molecules for such informa-\ntion. Manipulation of a DNA sequence and the construction of\nchimeric molecules\u2014so-called genetic engineering\u2014provide\na means of studying how a specific segment of DNA controls\ncellular function. New biochemical and molecular genetic tools\nallow investigators to query and manipulate genomic sequences\nas well as to examine the entire complement of cellular RNA,\nprotein, and protein PTM status at the molecular level in small\ntissue samples, and even single cells.\nUnderstanding molecular genetics technology is important\nfor several reasons: (1) It offers a rational approach to under-\nstanding the molecular basis of disease. For example, familial\nhypercholesterolemia, sickle cell disease, the thalassemias, cystic\nfibrosis, muscular dystrophy as well as more complex multifacto-\nrial diseases like vascular and heart disease, Alzheimer disease,cancer, obesity, and diabetes. (2) Human proteins can be pro-\nduced in abundance for therapy (eg, insulin, growth hormone,\ntissue plasminogen activator). (3) Proteins or nucleic acids for\npreparation of vaccines (eg, hepatitis B, COVID-19), and for\ndiagnostic testing (eg, Ebola and AIDS tests) can be readily\nobtained. (4) This technology is used both to diagnose existing\ndiseases as well as to predict the risk of developing a given disease\nand individual responses to pharmacologic therapeutics\u2014so\ncalled personalized medicine . (5) Special techniques have led to\nremarkable advances in forensic medicine, which have allowed\nfor the molecular diagnostic analysis of DNA from single cells.\n(6) Finally, in extremely well understood diseases, potentially\ncurative gene therapy for diseases caused by a single-gene defi-\nciency such as sickle cell disease, the thalassemias, adenosine\ndeaminase deficiency, and others are being devised.\nRECOMBINANT DNA\nTECHNOL\nOGY INVOLVES\nISOLATION & MANIPULATION\nOF DNA TO MAKE CHIMERIC\nMOLECULES\nIsolation and manipulation of DNA, including end-to-end\njoining of sequences fro\nm very different sources to make chi-\nmeric molecules (eg, molecules containing both human and\nbacterial DNA sequences in a sequence-independent fashion;\ngene fragments containing discrete functional elements, or\ncomplete genes), is the essence of recombinant DNA research.\nThis involves several unique techniques and reagents.O B J E C T I V E S\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou \nshould be able to:\u25a0Understand the basic procedures and methods involved in recombinant DNA\ntechnology \nand genetic engineering.\n\u25a0Appreciate the rationale behind the methods used to synthesize, analyze, and\nsequence \nDNA and RNA.\n\u25a0Be able to describe how to identify and quantify individual proteins, as well as\nproteins \nbound to specific sequences of genomic DNA or RNA.39Molecular Genetics,\nRe\ncombinant DNA, &\nGenomic Technology\nP .

These enzymes were\ntermed restriction enzymes , orREs, because their presence in\na given bacterium restricted, or prevented the growth of cer-\ntain bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). Restriction enzymes\ncut DNA of any source into unique pieces in a sequence-spe-\ncific manner\u2014in contrast to most other enzymatic, chemi-\ncal, or physical methods, which break DNA randomly. These\ndefensive enzymes (hundreds have been discovered) protect\nthe host bacterial DNA from the DNA genome of foreign\norganisms (primarily infective phages) by specifically inacti-\nvating the invading phage DNA by digestion. The viral RNA-\ninducible interferon system (see Chapter 38; Figure 38\u201311)\nprovides the same sort of molecular defense against RNA\nviruses in mammalian cells. However, restriction endonu-\ncleases are present only in cells that also have a companion\nenzyme that site-specifically methylates the DNA of the bac-\nterial host, thereby rendering it noncleavable by that par-\nticular restriction enzyme. Thus, sequence-specific DNA\nmethylases and sequence-specific restriction endonucleases\nthat target the exact same sites always exist in pairs in a given\nbacterium.\nRestriction enzymes are named after the bacterium\nfrom which they are isolated . For example, EcoRI is from\nEscherichia coli , and BamHI is from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\n(Table 39\u20131 ). The first three letters in the restriction enzyme\nname consist of the first letter of the genus ( E) and the first two\nletters of the species ( co) in the case of the restriction enzyme\nEcoRI derived from E. coli strain R. These designations may be\nfollowed by a strain designation ( R) and a roman numeral ( I)\nto indicate the order of discovery (eg, EcoRI andEcoRII ). Each\nenzyme recognizes and cleaves a specific double-stranded\nDNA sequence that is typically 4- to 8-bp long. These DNA\ncuts result in blunt ends (eg,HpaI ) or overlapping (sticky or\ncohesive) ends (eg,BamHI ) (Figure 39\u20131 ), depending on the\nmechanism used by the enzyme. Sticky ends are particularly\nuseful in constructing hybrid or chimeric DNA molecules\n(see later). If the four nucleotides are distributed randomly\nin a given DNA molecule, one can calculate how frequently\na given enzyme will cut a length of DNA. For each posi-\ntion in the DNA molecule, there are four possibilities (A, C,\nG, and T); therefore, a restriction enzyme that recognizes a\n4-bp sequence cuts DNA, on average, once every 256 bp (44),\nwhereas a\nnother enzyme that recognizes a 6-bp sequence cuts\nonce every 4096 bp (46). A given piece of DNA has a charac-\nteristic \nlinear array of sites for the various enzymes dictated\nby the linear sequence of its bases; hence, a restriction map\ncan be constructed.

Sticky ends of fragments also anneal so\nthat heterogeneous tandem inserts can form. Also, sticky-end\nsites may not be available or in a convenient position. To alle-\nviate these problems, an enzyme that generates blunt ends can\nbe used. Blunt ends can be ligated directly; however, ligation\nis not directional. To circumvent this problem new DNA ends\nof specific sequence can be added by direct blunt-end ligation\nusing the bacteriophage T4 enzyme DNA ligase. Alternatively,\nconvenient RE recognition sites can be added to a DNA frag-\nment through the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\namplification via thermostable DNA polymerases or, alter-\nnatively through direct DNA synthesis on a DNA synthesizer\n(see Figure 39\u20137).\nAs an adjunct to the use of restriction endonucleases to\ncombine and engineer DNA fragments, scientists have begun\nutilizing recombinases such as bacterial lox P sites, which are\nrecognized by the CRE recombinase, bacteriophage \u03bb attsites\nrecognized by the \u03bb phage encoded INT protein or yeast FRT\nsites recognized by the yeast Flp recombinase. These recom-\nbinase systems all catalyze specific incorporation of two DNA\nfragments that carry the appropriate recognition sequences\nand carry out homologous recombination (see Figure 35\u20139)\nbetween the relevant recognition sites. A novel DNA editing/\ngene regulatory system termed CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered reg-\nularly interspersed short palindromic repeats\u2013associated\ngene 9 ) first discovered in 2012, has revolutionized genomic\nDNA studies. The CRISPR system, found in many bacteria,\nrepresents a form of acquired, or adaptive immunity (see\nChapters 52 and 54) to prevent reinfection of a bacterium byspecific bacteriophages. CRISPR complements the system of\nrestriction endonucleases and methylases described earlier.\nCRISPR uses RNA-based targeting to bring the Cas9 nucle-\nase to foreign (or any complementary) DNA. Within bacteria\nthis CRISPR-RNA-Cas9 complex then degrades and inacti-\nvates the targeted DNA. The CRISPR system has been adapted\nfor use in eukaryotic cells, including human cells, where it\nhas been shown to be an RNA-directed site-specific nuclease\njust as it is in bacteria. Variations on the use of CRISPR allow\nfor gene deletion, gene editing, gene visualization, and even\nmodulation of gene transcription. Thus, CRISPR has added\nan exciting new, highly efficient, and very specific technol-\nogy to the toolbox of methods for the manipulation of DNA\nand genetic analysis of mammalian cells. The basic aspects of\nCRISPR-Cas9 function are outlined in Figure 39\u20132 .\nThe similarities of the CRISPR-Cas RNA-directed target-\ning and gene inactivation method and mi/siRNA-mediated\nrepression of expression in higher eukaryotes are notable.\nBoth methodologies are being actively pursued for experi-\nmental and therapeutic purposes. Interestingly, a variant of\nthe CRISPR-Cas system, C2c2, has been shown to site-specif-\nically cleave RNA.

This technique is based on the fact\nthat chimeric or hybrid DNA molecules can be constructed\nincloning vectors \u2014typically bacterial plasmids, phages, or\ncosmids (hybrid plasmids that also contain specific phage\nsequences )\u2014which then continue to replicate clonally in a\nsingle host cell under their own control systems. In this way,\nthe chimeric DNA is amplified. The general procedure is\nillustrated in Figure 39\u20133 .\nBacterial plasmids are small, circular, duplex DNA mole-\ncules whose natural function is to confer antibiotic resistance to\nthe host cell. Plasmids have several properties that make them\nextremely useful as cloning vectors. They exist as single or mul-\ntiple copies within the bacterium and replicate independently\nfrom the bacterial DNA as episomes (ie,a genome above\nor outside the bacterial genome ) while using primarily the\nhost replication machinery. The complete DNA sequence of\nthousands of plasmids is known; hence, the precise location\nof restriction enzyme cleavage sites for inserting foreign DNA\nis available. Plasmids are smaller than the host chromosome\nand are therefore easily biochemically separated from the\nlatter, and the desired plasmid-inserted DNA can be readilyremoved by cutting the plasmid with the enzyme specific for\nthe restriction site into which the original piece of DNA was\ninserted.\nPhages (bacterial viruses) often have linear DNA genomes\ninto which foreign DNA can be inserted at unique restriction\nenzyme sites. The resulting chimeric DNA is collected after\nthe phage proceeds through its lytic cycle and produces mature,\ninfective phage particles. A major advantage of phage vectors is\nthat while plasmids accept DNA pieces up to about 10-kb long,\nphages can readily accept DNA fragments up to ~20-kb long.\nThe ultimate insert size is imposed by the amount of DNA that\ncan be packed into the phage head during virus propagation.\nLarger fragments of DNA can be cloned in cosmids,\nDNA cloning vectors that combine the best features of plas-\nmids and phages. Cosmids are plasmids that contain the DNA\nsequences, so-called cohesive end sites (cos sites ), required\nfor packaging lambda DNA into the phage particle. These vec-\ntors grow in the plasmid form in bacteria, but since much of\nthe unnecessary lambda DNA has been removed, more chi-\nmeric DNA can be packaged into the particle head. Cosmids\ncan carry inserts of chimeric DNA that are 35- to 50-kb long.\nEven larger pieces of DNA can be incorporated into bacterial\nA\nTTAT\nDNA\nligase\nPlasmid DNA \nmolecule with human DNA insert\n(recombinant DNA molecule)T\nA\nA\nA\nTTAATTAA\nTTATT\nA\nA\nA\nTTAATTACircular plasmid DNA Linear plasmid DNA\nwith sticky endsHuman DNA\nAnnealEcoRI\nrestriction\nendonuclease A\nA\nA\nT\nTATT\nA A T T\nT T\nPiece of human DNA cut with\ntheEcoRI restriction nuclease\ncontains the same sticky ends\nas the EcoRI -digested plasmidA AGG\nCC\nG\nC\nG\nCCGG\nGG\nC\nCCC\nG\nGCGC\nEcoRI restriction\nendonuclease\ncleav\nage\nFIGURE 39\u20133 Use of restriction endonucleases to make new recombinant or chimeric DNA molecules. When inserted back into a\nbacterial cell (by the process called DNA-mediated transformation), typically only a single plasmid is taken up by a single cell, and the plasmid\nDNA replicates clonally, not only itself, but also the physically linked new DNA insert. Since recombining the sticky ends, as indicated, typically\nregenerates the same DNA sequence recognized by the original restriction enzyme, the cloned DNA insert can be cleanly cut back out of the\nrecombinant plasmid circle with this endonuclease. Alternatively, the insert sequences can be specifically amplified from the purified chimeric\nplasmid DNA by PCR (see Figure 39\u20137).

A comparison of these vectors is shown in Table 39\u20133 .\nBecause insertion of DNA into a functional region of the\nvector will interfere with the action of this region, care must\nbe taken not to interrupt an essential function of the vector.\nThis concept can be exploited, however, to provide a powerful\ndouble positive/negative selection technique. For example, a\ncommon early plasmid vector pBR322 has genes conferring\nresistance to both tetracycline (Tet) andampicillin (Amp) ,\nthat is, Tetr- and Ampr-resistant growth, respectively. A single\nPs\ntIrestriction enzyme site within the Amp resistance geneis commonly used as the insertion site for a piece of foreign\nDNA. In addition to having sticky ends (see Table 39\u20131 and\nFigure 39\u20131), the DNA inserted at this site disrupts the ORF\nof the \u03b2-lactamse-encoding blagene. \u03b2-Lactamase, a secreted\nenzyme degrades and inactivates ampicillin. A bacterium car-\nrying a plasmid with an inserted DNA fragment in the blagene\nwill be Amp-sensitive (Amps). Thus, cells carrying the parental\nplasm\nid, which provides resistance to both antibiotics, can be\nreadily distinguished via replica plating, and separated from\ncells carrying the chimeric plasmid, which is resistant only to\ntetracycline ( Figure 39\u20134 ). YACs contain selection, replication,\nand segregation functions that work in both bacteria and yeast\ncells and therefore can be propagated in either organism.\nIn addition to the vectors described in Table 39\u20133 that are\ndesigned primarily for propagation in bacterial cells, vectors\nfor mammalian cell propagation and insert gene-(cDNA)/\nprotein expression have also been developed. These vectors are\nall based on various eukaryotic viruses that are composed of\nRNA or DNA genomes. Notable examples of such viral vectors\nare those utilizing adenoviral (Ad) , oradenovirus-associated\nviral (AAV) (DNA-based) and retroviral (RNA based) genomes.\nThough somewhat limited in the size of DNA sequences that can\nbe inserted, such mammalian viral cloning vectors make up for\nthis shortcoming because they will efficiently infect a wide range\nof different cell types. For this reason, various mammalian viral\nvectors, some with both positive and negative selection genes\n(akaselectable \u201cmarkers\u201d as noted earlier for pBR322) are being\nused for both laboratory experiments and human gene therapy .TABLE 39\u20133 Cloning Capacities of Common Cloning\nV\nectors\nVector DNA Insert Size (kb)\nPlasmid \npUC19 0.01-10\nLambda charon 4A 10-20\nCosmids 35-50\nBAC, P1 50-250\nYAC 500-3000\nAmpr\nTetrPstIEcoRI\nHindIII\nBamHI\nSalIAmpicillin\nresistance geneTetracycline\nresistance gene\nHost pBR322Amps\nTetrPstIPstIEcoRI\nHindIII\nBamHI\nSalI\nChimeric \npBR322Tetracycline\nresistance gene\nCut open with\nPstI\nThen insert\nPstI-cut DNA\nFIGURE 39\u20134 A method of screening recombinants for inserted DNA fragments.

Hence, cells carrying the chimeric plasmid will no longer grow/survive when cultured in liquid, or plated on a substrate medium\nthat contains this antibiotic. The differential sensitivity to tetracycline and ampicillin can therefore be used to distinguish clones of plasmid that\ncontain an insert. A similar scheme relying on production of an in-frame fusion of a newly inserted DNA producing a peptide fragment capable of\ncomplementing an inactive, N-terminally truncated form of the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase, a component of the lacoperon (see Figure 38\u20132) allows\nfor blue\u2013white colony formation on agar plates containing a dye hydrolyzable by \u03b2-galactosidase. \u03b2-galactosidase\u2013positive colonies are blue; such\ncolonies contain plasmids in which a DNA was successfully inserted."

A collection of these dif-\nferent recombinant clones is called a library. A genomic library is\nprepared from the total DNA of a cell line or tissue that has been\nfragmented using either restriction endonucleases, or shearing\nand adaptor ligation to the resulting fragments. A cDNA library\ncomprises complementary DNA copies of the population of\nmRNAs in a tissue. Genomic DNA libraries are often prepared\nby performing partial digestion of total DNA with a restriction\nenzyme that cuts DNA frequently (eg, a four-base cutter such\nasTaqI). The idea is to generate rather large fragments so that\nmost genes will be left intact. The BAC, YAC, and P1 vectors\nare preferred since they can accept very large fragments of DNA\nand thus offer a better chance of isolating an intact eukaryotic\nmRNA-encoding gene on a single DNA fragment.\nA vector in which the protein coded by the gene intro-\nduced by recombinant DNA technology is actually synthesized\nis known as an expression vector . Such vectors are now com-\nmonly used to detect specific cDNA molecules in libraries\nand to produce proteins by genetic engineering techniques.\nThese vectors are specially constructed to contain very active\ninducible promoters, proper in-phase translation initiation\ncodons, transcription and translation termination signals,\nand appropriate protein processing signals, if needed. Some\nexpression vectors even contain genes that code for prote-\nase inhibitors, so that the final yield of product is enhanced.\nInterestingly, as the cost of synthetic DNA synthesis has\ndropped, many investigators now often simply synthesize\nan entire cDNA (gene) of interest (in 100\u2013150 nt segments)\nincorporating the codon preferences of the host used for\nexpression in order to maximize protein production. New\nefficiencies in synthetic DNA synthesis now allow for the de\nnovo synthesis of complete genes and even (small) genomes,\nobviating, in part, the need to generate and carefully probe\ncomplex genomic libraries to identify/obtain specific gene\nsequences. These advances usher in new and exciting possi-\nbilities in synthetic biology while concomitantly introducing\npotential ethical conundrums.\nProbes Search Libraries or Complex\nSamples \nfor Specific Genes or cDNA\nMolecules\nA variety of molecules can be used to \u201cprobe\u201d libraries in\nsearch \nof a specific gene or cDNA molecule or to define and\nquantitate DNA or RNA separated by electrophoresis through\nvarious gels. Probes are generally molecules of DNA or RNA\nlabeled with a32P-containing nucleotide\u2014or fluorescently\nlabeled \nnucleotide(s) (more commonly now). Importantly,\nneither modification (32P- or fluorescent-label) affects the\nhybridiza\ntion properties of the resulting labeled nucleic acidprobes. The probe must recognize a complementary sequence\nto be effective. A cDNA synthesized from a specific mRNA\n(or a synthetic oligonucleotide) can be used to screen either\na cDNA library for a longer cDNA or a genomic library for\na complementary sequence in the coding region of a gene.\ncDNA/oligonucleotide/cRNA probes are used to detect DNA\nfragments on Southern blot transfers and to detect and quanti-\ntate RNA on Northern blot transfers (see later). PCR methods\ncan be used for both tasks (see later).\nBlotting & Probing Techniques Allow\nVisualiza\ntion of Specific Target\nMolecules\nVisualization of a specific DNA or RNA fragment (or pro-\ntein\n, see later) among the many thousands of nontarget\nmolecules in a complex sample requires the convergence\nof a number of techniques, collectively termed blot trans-\nfer.Figure 39\u20135 illustrates the Southern (DNA), Northern\n(RNA), and Western (protein) blot transfer procedures. The\nfirst technique is named for the person who devised the tech-\nnique, Edward Southern; the other names began as labora-\ntory jargon, but are now accepted terms. These procedures\nare useful in determining how many copies of a gene are in\na given tissue or whether there are any alterations in a gene\n(deletions, insertions, or rearrangements) because the requi-\nsite, initial gel electrophoresis step separates the molecules\non the basis of size. Occasionally, if a specific base is changed\nand a restriction site is altered, these procedures can detect\na point mutation. The Northern and Western blot transfer\ntechniques are used to size and quantify specific RNA and\nprotein molecules, respectively. A fourth technique, the\nSouthwestern oroverlay blot , which examines protein\u2013\nnucleic acid interactions or protein\u2013protein interactions,\nrespectively are variants of the Southern/Northern/Western\nblotting methods (not shown). In these last two techniques,\nproteins are separated by electrophoresis, blotted to a mem-\nbrane, renatured, and analyzed for an interaction with a\nparticular DNA, or RNA sequence, or protein by incubation\nwith a specific labeled nucleic acid probe (Southwestern) or\nprotein probe (overlay assay) using either a labeled protein,\nor alternatively protein\u2013protein interactions are detected\nusing a specific antibody.\nAll of the nucleic acid\u2013based hybridization procedures\ndiscussed in this section depend on the specific base-pair-\ning properties of complementary nucleic acid strands (see\nChapter 34). Perfect matches hybridize readily and with-\nstand high temperatures and/or low ionic strength buffer in\nthe hybridization and washing reactions. Less than perfect\nmatches do not tolerate such stringent conditions (ie, ele-\nvated temperatures and low-salt concentrations); thus, hybrid-\nization either never occurs or is disrupted during the washing\nstep. Hybridization conditions capable of detecting just a sin-\ngle base-pair (bp) mismatch between probe and target have\nbeen devised."

The manual enzymatic Sanger method employs\nspecific dideoxynucleotides that terminate DNA strand syn-\nthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase, at specific nucleotides\nas the strand is synthesized on purified single-stranded tem-\nplate DNA. The reactions are adjusted so that a population of\nDNA fragments representing termination at every nucleotide\nis obtained. By having a radioactive label incorporated at the\ntermination site, one can separate the fragments according to\nsize using high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nThe resulting gel is vacuum dried onto filter paper and used\nto expose an x-ray film or more commonly a special imaging\nplate, which allows the visualization of the labeled DNA frag-\nments generated during sequencing. These images are read\nin order to give the DNA sequence as shown in Figure 39\u20136 ,\nwhich is an example of first-generation, Sanger DNA sequenc-\ning.

Such third-generation sequencers promise to\nyet again revolutionize the field of nucleic acid sequencing.\nOligonucleotide Synthesis Is Now\nRoutine\nAutomated chemical synthesis of moderately long oligonucle-\notides \n(100+ nucleotides) of exact sequence is now a routine\nlaboratory procedure. Each synthetic cycle takes but minutes\nsuch that very large dsDNA molecules can be made by syn-\nthesizing relatively short segments that are annealed and then\nligated to one another. As mentioned earlier for DNA sequenc-\ning, the process has been miniaturized and can be significantly\nparallelized to allow the synthesis of hundreds to thou-\nsands of defined sequence oligonucleotides simultaneously.DNA*DNA\nDNA*RNA\nAntibody*Protein\nGel\nelectrophoresis\nTransfer to paper\nImage-specific\nprobe bindingAdd probeDNA Blot\n(Southern )RNA Blot\n(Northern )Protein Blot\n(Western )\nFIGURE 39\u20135 The blot transfer procedure. In a Southern, or\nDNA blot transfer, DNA isolated from a cell line or tissue is digested\nwith one or more restriction enzymes. This mixture is pipetted into\na well in an agarose or polyacrylamide gel and exposed to a direct\nelectrical current. DNA, being negatively charged, migrates toward\nthe anode; the smaller fragments move the most rapidly. After a suit-\nable time, the DNA within the gel is denatured by exposure to mild\nalkali and transferred, via capillary action (or electrotransfer\u2014not\nshown), to nitrocellulose or nylon paper, resulting in an exact replica\nof the pattern on the gel, using the blotting technique devised by\nSouthern blot. The DNA is bound to the paper by exposure to heat or\nUV, and the paper is then exposed to the labeled DNA probe, which\nhybridizes to complementary strands on the filter. After thorough\nwashing, the paper is exposed to x-ray film or an imaging screen,\nwhich is developed to reveal several specific bands corresponding\nto the DNA fragment(s) that were recognized (hybridized to) by the\nsequences in the DNA probe. The RNA, or Northern, blot is conceptu-\nally similar. RNA is subjected to electrophoresis before blot transfer.\nThis requires some different steps from those of DNA transfer, primar-\nily to ensure that the RNA remains intact, and is generally somewhat\nmore difficult. In the protein, or Western, blot, proteins are electro-\nphoresed and transferred to special paper that avidly binds proteins\nand then probed with a specific antibody or other probe molecule.\n(Asterisks signify labeled probes, either radioactive or fluorescent.)\nIn the case of Southwestern blotting (see the text; not shown), a pro-\ntein blot similar to that shown above under \u201cWestern\u201d is exposed to\nlabeled nucleic acid, and protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes formed are\ndetected by autoradiography or imaging."

The\ndevelopm\nent of PCR has revolutionized the ways in which\nboth DNA and RNA can be studied. PCR provides a sensi-\ntive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any\ndesired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of\ntwo oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary\nsequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target\nsequence (Figure 39\u20137 ). The DNA sample is first heat dena-\ntured (>90 \u00b0C) to separate the two strands of the template DNA\ncontaining the target sequence; the primers, added in excess,\nare allowed to anneal to the DNA (typically at 50-75 \u00b0C) in\norder to generate the required template-primer complex. Sub-\nsequently, each strand is copied by a special DNA polymerase,starting at the primer sites in the presence of all four dXTPs.\nThe two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthe-\nsis of new DNA from the two primers. Repeated cycles of heat\ndenaturation, annealing of the primers to their complemen-\ntary sequences, and extension of the annealed primers with\nDNA polymerase result in the exponential amplification of\nDNA segments of defined length. Product DNA doubles with\neach PCR cycle. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a heat-stable\nDNA polymerase purified from one of a number of different\nthermophilic bacteria, organisms that grow at 70 \u00b0to 80\u00b0C.\nThermostable DNA polymerases can withstand multiple,\nshort incubations at more than 90 \u00b0, temperatures required to\ncompletely denature DNA. These thermostable DNA poly-\nmerases have made automation of PCR possible.\nDNA sequences as short as 50 to 100 bp and as long as\n10 kb can readily be amplified by PCR. Twenty cycles provide\nan amplification of 106(ie, 220) and 30 cycles, 109(230). Each\ncycle \ntakes less than or equal to 5 to 10 minutes so that even\nlarge DNA molecules can be amplified fairly rapidly. Because\nof subtle differences in DNA sequence with each new PCR\ntarget, the exact conditions for amplification must be empiri-\ncally optimized.

The PCR method\nallows the DNA in a single cell, hair follicle, or spermatozoon\nto be amplified and analyzed. Thus, the applications of PCR to\nforensic medicine are obvious. PCR is also used to: (1) detect\nand quantify infectious agents, especially latent viruses; (2) make\naccurate genetic diagnoses by producing DNA fragments for sub-\nsequent DNA sequence analyses to identify mutations; (3) detect\nallelic polymorphisms ranging from single base pair changes to\nlarge and small indels and gene amplification; (4) establish precise\ntissue types for transplants; and (5) study evolution, using DNA\nfrom archeological samples (6) for quantitative RNA analyses\nafter RNA copying and mRNA quantitation by the so-called RT-\nPCR method (cDNA copies of mRNA generated by a retroviral\nreverse transcriptase) or (7) to score in vivo protein-DNA occu-\npancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (see later).\nNew uses of PCR are developed every year.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\nOF \nRECOMBINANT DNA\nTECHNOLOGY ARE NUMEROUS\nThe isolation of a specific (ca 1000 bp) mRNA-encoding gene\nfrom \nan entire human genome requires a technique that will\ndiscriminate one part in 1,000,000. The identification of a\nregulatory region that may be only 10 bp in length requires a\nsensitivity of one part in 300,000,000; a disease such as sickle\ncell anemia is caused by a single base change, or one part in\n3,000,000,000. DNA technology is powerful enough to accom-\nplish all these things.\nProteins Can Be Produced for Research,\nDiagnosis, \n& Commerce\nA practical goal of recombinant DNA research is the production\nof \nmaterials for biomedical applications. This technology has\ntwo distinct merits: (1) it can supply large amounts of material\nthat could not be obtained by conventional purification meth-\nods (eg, interferon, tissue plasminogen activating factor, etc.);\nand (2) it can provide human proteins (eg, insulin and growth\nhormone). The advantages in both cases are obvious. Although\nthe primary aim is to supply products\u2014generally proteins\u2014for\ntreatment (insulin) and diagnosis (AIDS testing) of human and\nother animal diseases and for disease prevention (hepatitis B;\nCOVID-19 vaccines), there are other potential commercial\napplications, especially in agriculture. An example of the latter is\nthe attempt to engineer plants that are more resistant to drought\nor temperature extremes, more efficient at fixing nitrogen, or that\nproduce seeds containing the complete complement of essential\namino acids (rice, wheat, corn, etc.).\nDirect Sequencing of Genomic DNA & Exomes\nAs noted earlier, recent advances in DNA-sequencing technol-\nogy\n, the so-called NGS, or high-throughput sequencing (HTS)\nplatforms, have dramatically reduced the per base cost of DNA\nsequencing.

The cost of sequencing of the same\n3 \n\u00d7 109bp diploid human genome using the new NGS plat-\nforms is estimated to be less than 0.03% of the original. Thus,\nhuman genome sequencing for less than or equal to $1000\n(US), and exomes for less than or equal to $500 (US) is readily\navailable. This dramatic reduction in cost has stimulated vari-\nous international initiatives to sequence the entire genomes/\nexomes of hundreds of thousands of individuals of various\nracial and ethnic backgrounds in order to determine the\ntrue extent of DNA/genome polymorphisms present within\nthe human population. The resulting cornucopia of genetic\ninformation, and the ever-decreasing cost of genomic DNA\nsequencing is dramatically increasing our ability to diagnose\nand, ultimately treat human disease. Obviously, when personal\ngenome sequencing does become commonplace, dramatic\nchanges in the practice of medicine will result because ther-\napies will ultimately be custom tailored to the exact genetic\nmakeup of each individual.\nGene Therapy & Stem Cell Biology\nDiseases caused by deficiency of a single-gene product are all\ntheoretically a\nmenable to replacement therapy. The strategy is\nto clone a normal copy of the relevant gene (eg, the gene that\ncodes for adenosine deaminase) into a vector that will readily\nbe taken up and incorporated into the genome of a host cell.\nBone marrow precursor cells are being investigated for this\npurpose because they presumably will resettle in the marrow\nand replicate there. The introduced gene would begin to direct\nthe expression of its protein product, and this would correct\nthe deficiency in the host cell.\nAs an alternative to \u201creplacing\u201d defective genes to cure human\ndisease, many scientists are investigating the feasibility of identify-\ning and characterizing pluripotent stem cells that have the ability\nto differentiate into any cell type in the body. Recent results in this\nfield have shown that adult human somatic cells can readily be\nconverted into apparent induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs )\nby transfection with cDNAs encoding a handful of DNA-binding\ntranscription factors. These and other new developments in the\nfields of gene therapy and stem cell biology promise exciting new\npotential therapies for curing human disease. Finally, generating\niPSCs from diseased patient cells also offer the opportunity to\ncreate authentic human cell\u2013based models for laboratory studies\nof the molecular basis of human disease.\nTransgenic Animals\nThe somatic cell gene replacement therapy described earlier\nwould \nobviously not be passed on to offspring. Other strate-\ngies to alter germ cell lines have been devised but have been\ntested only in experimental animals. A certain percentage of\ngenes injected into a fertilized mouse ovum will be incorpo-\nrated into the genome and found in both somatic and germ\ncells. Hundreds of transgenic animals have been established,\nand these are useful for analysis of tissue-specific effects on\ngene expression and effects of overproduction of gene prod-\nucts (eg, those from the growth hormone gene or oncogenes)and in discovering genes involved in development, a process\nthat heretofore has been difficult to study in mammals. The\ntransgenic approach has been used to correct a genetic defi-\nciency in mice. Fertilized ova obtained from mice with genetic\nhypogonadism were injected with DNA containing the coding\nsequence for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)\nprecursor protein. This gene was expressed and regulated nor-\nmally in the hypothalamus of a certain number of the resultant\nmice, and these animals were in all respects normal. Their off-\nspring also showed no evidence of GnRH deficiency. This is,\ntherefore, evidence of somatic cell expression of the transgene\nand of its maintenance in germ cells.\nTargeted Gene Regulation by\nDisruption \nor \u201cKnockout\u201d , \u201cKnockin\u201d ,\nEditing, & Controlled Expression\nVarious technical advances have allowed for the precise, tar-\ngeted \nmodification of mammalian genes. The exact methods\nused for genetically engineering mammalian genomes have\nevolved from tedious, low-efficiency methods based on positive\nand negative drug selections and homologous recombination\n(Knockout/Knockin) to the recently described CRISPR-Cas9\nsystem described earlier. The goal of all of these methods is\nultimately to generate a family of genetic variants of a gene of\ninterest that are (a) a null, or complete loss-of-function allele;\n(b) recessive, loss-of-function alleles; and (c) ideally, dominant\ngain-of-function alleles. These genetic alterations are generated\nin pluripotent stem cells, which ultimately allow for introduc-\ntion and propagation in whole model organisms (fruit fly, fish,\nworms, rodents, etc.). Having all three of these genetic vari-\nants allows one to precisely dissect the mechanism of action\nof any gene. However, complicating genetic analyses of many\ngenes is the fact that their function(s) are essential for viability.\nTo get around this problem, cell-type or tissue-specific genetic\nvariants must be generated. This hurdle has been overcome\nthrough the use of cell- and tissue-specific enhancers that can\ndrive the conditional (ie, experimentally controlled) expression\nof the targeting recombinases (ie, CRE-lox) and/or nuclease\n(CRISPR-Cas9) that generate the altered genes, either null or\nloss- or gain-of-function alleles. Alternatively, selected loss-of-\nfunction alleles can be generated through equivalent siRNA\nexpression to knock down production of a specific gene prod-\nuct. Collectively, these methods allow for sophisticated genetic\nand biochemical tests of gene function and allow scientists to\nprobe the structure and function of mammalian genes in phys-\niologic contexts. Tremendous molecular mechanistic insights\nhave been, and will continue to be, obtained into the molecular\netiology of human disease through these and other biochemi-\ncal approaches.

Additional genomes are being\nsequenced at an accelerating pace. The availability of all of\nthis DNA sequence information, coupled with engineering\nadvances, has led to the development of several revolution-\nary methodologies, most of which are based on second- and\nthird-generation sequencing platforms. In the case of auto-\nmated DNA sequencing, mRNAs are converted to cDNAs\nusing retroviral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases to reverse\ntranscribe mRNAs to DNAs. The resulting cDNAs are ampli-\nfied and directly sequenced; this method is termed RNA-Seq .\nThese methods allow for the quantitative description of the\nentire transcriptome. Recent reports in the literature have used\nRNA-Seq to describe the transcriptome of single cells, and\nwhen coupled with high-sensitivity ribosome profiling (see\nlater) and mass spectrometry\u2013based proteomics (see later),\nconfidently define gene expression profiles at the mRNA and\nprotein levels.\nRecent methodologic advances (PRO-Seq ,Precision Run-\nOn sequencing , and NET-Seq ,native elongating transcript\nsequencing) allow for sequencing of RNA within elongat-\ning RNA polymerase-DNA-RNA ternary complexes, thereby\nallowing nucleotide-level descriptions, genome-wide, of active\ntranscription in living cells. A parallel method termed ribo-\nsome profiling allows investigators to use high-throughput\nDNA sequencing to determine both the identity and num-\nber of cellular mRNAs in the process of being actively trans-\nlated\u2014thereby defining the cellular proteome. Transcriptome\ninformation allows one to quantitatively predict the collection\nof proteins that might be expressed in a particular cell, tissue,\nor organ in normal and disease states based on the mRNAs\npresent in those cells, while ribosome profiling allows for the\nquantitative measurement of the actual cellular proteome,\nparticularly when coupled with newer high sensitivity mass\nspectrometry to analyze protein content and PTM status of\ncellular proteomes (see later).\nComplementing the very high-throughput, genome-wide\nexpression profiling methods described earlier is the develop-\nment of methods to map the location, or occupancy of specific\nproteins bound to discrete DNA sequences within living cells.\nThis method, illustrated in Figure 39\u20138 , is termed chroma-\ntin immunoprecipitation (ChIP ). Proteins are cross-linked\nin situ in cells or tissues, the cellular chromatin is isolated,\nsheared, and specific cross-linked protein-DNA complexes\npurified using antibodies that recognize a particular protein,\nor protein isoform. DNA bound to this protein is recovered\nand amplified using PCR and analyzed using gel electrophore-\nsis imaging, microarray hybridization ( ChIP-chip ), or direct\nsequencing. There are two versions of the DNA sequenc-\ning assay readout. In the first, the immunopurified DNA is\ndirectly subjected to NGS/high-throughput DNA sequenc-\ning ( ChIP-Seq ); in the second version, the immunopurified,\ncross-linked protein-DNA complex is treated with exonucle-\nases to remove cross-linked DNA sequences that are not inintimate contact with the protein of interest; this is termed\nChIP-Exo . Collectively ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq methods\nallow investigators to identify the locations of a single protein\ngenome-wide throughout all the chromosomes. ChIP-Exo has\nthe added advantage of allowing investigators to map in vivo\nprotein occupancy at single nucleotide-level resolution. Finally,\nmethods for high-sensitivity, high-throughput mass spectrom-\netry of metabolites (metabolomics) , various small molecules\n(lipids, lipidomics ; carbohydrates, glycomics, etc.) , and com-\nplex protein samples (proteomics) have been developed. Newer\nmass spectrometry methods allow scientists to identify thou-\nsands of proteins in complex samples extracted from very small\nnumbers of cells (<1 g). Such analyses can now be used to quantify\nthe relative amounts of proteins in two samples, as well as the\nlevel of certain PTMs, such as phosphorylation, acetylation etc.;\nand with the use of specific antibodies, define specific protein\u2013\nprotein interactions. This critical information tells investigators\nwhich of the many mRNAs detected in transcriptome mapping\nstudies are being translated into protein, generally the ultimate\ndictator of cellular/tissue/organismal phenotypes.\nNew genetic means for identifying protein\u2013protein inter-\nactions and protein function have also been devised. System-\natic genome-wide gene expression knockdown using siRNAs,\nsynthetic lethal genetic interaction screens, or most recently\nCRISPR-Cas9 knockdown have been used to assess the con-\ntribution of individual genes to a variety of processes in model\nsystems (yeast, worms, and flies) and mammalian cells (human\nand mouse). Specific network mappings of protein\u2013protein\ninteractions, on a genome-wide basis, have been identified\nusing high-throughput variants of the two-hybrid interaction\ntest ( Figure 39\u20139 ). This simple yet powerful method can be\nperformed in bacteria, yeast, or metazoan cells, and allows for\nthe detection of specific protein\u2013protein interactions in living\ncells. Reconstruction experiments indicate that protein\u2013pro-\ntein interactions with binding affinities of Kd~10\u22126mol/L or\ntighter can readily be detected with this method. Together,\nthese technologies provide powerful tools with which to dis-\nsect the intricacies of human biology.\nSYSTEMS BIOLOGY AIMS TO\nINTEGRA\nTE THE FLOOD OF \u2013OMIC\nDATA IN ORDER TO DECIPHER\nFUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGIC\nREGULATORY PRINCIPLES\nMicroarray techniques, high-throughput genomic DNA\nsequencing, \nRNA-Seq, ribosome profiling, mass spectrom-\netry, ChIP-Seq/ChIP-Exo, genome-wide two-hybrid screens,\ngenetic knockdown, and synthetic lethal screens coupled with\nmass spectrometric protein and metabolite identification\nexperiments have led to the generation of enormous amounts\nof data.

This method allows for the precise localization of a\nparticular protein (or modified protein if an appropriate antibody is available; for example, n= anti-phosphorylated or acetylated histones,\ntranscription factors, etc.) on a particular sequence element in living cells. Depending on the method used to analyze the immunopurified\nDNA, quantitative or semiquantitative information, at near nucleotide level resolution, can be obtained. Protein-DNA occupancy can be scored\ngenome-wide in two ways. First, by ChIP-chip, a method that uses a hybridization readout. In ChIP-chip total genomic DNA is labeled with one\nparticular fluorophore and the immunopurified DNA is labeled with a spectrally distinct fluorophore. These differentially labeled DNAs are mixed\nand hybridized to microarray \u201cchips\u201d (microscope slides) that contain specific DNA fragments, or more commonly now, synthetic oligonucleotide\n50 to 70 nucleotides long. These gene-specific oligonucleotides are deposited and covalently attached at predetermined, known X,Y position/\ncoordinates on the slide. The labeled DNAs are hybridized, the slides washed and hybridization to each gene-specific oligonucleotide probe is\nscored using differential laser scanning and sensitive photodetection at micron resolution. The hybridization signal intensities are quantified, and\nthe ratio of IP DNA/genomic DNA signals is used to score occupancy levels. The second method, termed ChIP-Seq, directly sequences immuno-\npurified DNAs using NGS sequencing methods. Two variants of ChIP-Seq are shown: \u201cstandard\u201d ChIP-Seq and ChIP-Exo. These two approaches\ndiffer in their ability to resolve and map the locations of the bound protein on genomic DNA. Standard ChIP-Seq resolution is 50 to 100 nt reso-\nlution, while ChIP-Exo has near single nt level resolution. Both approaches rely on efficient bioinformatic algorithms to deal with the very large\ndatasets that are generated. ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq techniques provide a (semi-) quantitative measure of in vivo protein occupancy. Though not\nschematized here, similar methods termed RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation) or CLIP (cross-linking protein-RNA and immunoprecipitation), which\ndiffer primarily in the method of protein-RNA cross-linking, can score the in vivo binding of specific proteins to specific RNA species (typically\nmRNAs, though any RNA species can be analyzed by these techniques)."

(1)A reporter gene, either a selectable\nmarker (ie, a gene conferring prototrophic growth on selective media,\nor producing an enzyme for which a colony colorimetric assay exists,\nsuch as \u03b2-galactosidase) that is expressed only when a transcrip-\ntion factor binds upstream to a cis-linked enhancer (dark red bar).\n(2)A \u201cbait\u201d fusion protein (DBD-X) produced from a chimeric gene\nexpressing a modular DNA-binding domain (DBD ; often derived from\nthe yeast Gal4 protein or the bacterial Lex A protein, both high-affin-\nity, high-specificity DNA-binding proteins) fused in-frame to a protein\nof interest, here X. In two hybrid experiments, one is testing whether\nany protein can interact with protein X. Prey protein X may be fused\nin its entirety or often alternatively just a portion of protein X is\nexpressed in-frame with the DBD. (3)A \u201cprey\u201d protein (Y-AD) , which\nrepresents a fusion of a specific protein fused in-frame to a transcrip-\ntional activation domain (AD; often derived from either the herpes\nsimplex virus VP16 activator protein or the yeast GAL4 protein). This\nsystem serves as a useful test of protein\u2013protein interactions between\nproteins X and Y because in the absence of a functional transactivator\nbinding to the indicated enhancer, no transcription of the reporter\ngene occurs (ie, see Figure 38\u201316). Thus, one observes transcription\nonly if protein X\u2013protein Y interaction occurs, thereby bringing a\nfunctional AD to the cis-linked transcription unit, in this case activat-\ning transcription of the reporter gene. In this scenario, protein DBD-X\nalone fails to activate reporter transcription because the X-domain\nfused to the DBD does not contain an AD. Similarly, protein Y-AD\nalone fails to activate reporter gene transcription because it lacks a\nDBD to target the Y-AD protein to the enhancer-promoter-reporter\ngene. Only when both proteins are expressed in a single cell and\nbind the enhancer and, via DBD-X\u2013Y-AD protein\u2013protein interactions,\nregenerate a functional transactivator binary \u201cprotein,\u201d does reporter\ngene transcription result in activation and mRNA synthesis (green line\nfrom AD to reporter gene).\nprotein PTM profiling, and systems biology will revolutionize\nour \nunderstanding of physiology and medicine and ultimately\nhuman health.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0In DNA cloning, a particular segment of DNA is either directly\nsynthesized, \nor is removed from its normal environment using\nPCR or one of many DNA-directed endonucleases. Such DNAis then ligated into a vector in which the DNA segment can be\nindividually amplified and produced in abundance.\n\u25a0Manipulation of the DNA to change its sequence, so-called\ngenetic \nengineering, is a key element in cloning (eg, the\nconstruction of chimeric molecules) and can also be used to\nstudy the function of a certain fragment of DNA and to analyze\nhow genes are regulated.\n\u25a0A variety of very sensitive techniques can now be applied to the\nisolation \nand characterization of genes and to the quantitation\nof gene products in both static (ie, equilibrium) and dynamic\n(kinetic) modes. These methods allow for the identification\nof the genes responsible for diseases, and for the study of how\nfaulty genes/gene regulation causes disease.\n\u25a0Mammalian genomes can now be precisely engineered to\nknockin (add/re\nplace a gene), knockout (delete or inactivate),\nand/or actively and conditionally manipulate specific genes\nusing miRNAs and SiRNAs, and novel genome editing enzymes\n(recombinases) and enzyme-RNA systems (CRISPR-Cas).\nREFERENCES\nBaltimore D, Berg P , Botchan M, et al.: Biotechnology.

The extracellular fluid is a bidirectional deliv-\nery system . The ECF brings cells nutrients (eg, glucose, fatty\nacids, and amino acids), oxygen, various ions and trace min-\nerals, and a variety of regulatory molecules (hormones) that\ncoordinate the functions of widely separated cells.

Phosphatidylcholine is generally the major phos-\nphoglyceride by mass in the membranes of human cells.\nThe second major class of phospholipids comprises sphin-\ngomyelin (see Figure 21\u201311), a phospholipid that contains a\nsphingosine rather than a glycerol backbone. A fatty acid is\nattached by an amide linkage to the amino group of sphingo-\nsine, forming ceramide . When the primary hydroxyl group of\nsphingosine is esterified to phosphorylcholine, sphingomyelin\nis formed. As the name suggests, sphingomyelin is prominent\nin myelin sheaths.\nGlycosphingolipids\nThe glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are sugar-containing lipids\nbuilt on a backbone of ceramide . GSLs include galactosyl -\nandglucosyl-ceramides (cerebrosides) and the gangliosides\n(see structures in Chapter 21), and are mainly located in the\nplasma membranes of cells, displaying their sugar components\nto the exterior of the cell.Sterols\nThe most common sterol in the membranes of animal cells\nischolesterol (see \nChapter 21). The majority of cholesterol\nresides within plasma membranes , but smaller amounts are\nfound within mitochondrial, Golgi complex, and nuclear\nmembranes. Cholesterol intercalates among the phospholipids\nof the membrane, with its hydrophilic hydroxyl group at the\naqueous interface and the remainder of the molecule buried\nwithin the lipid bilayer leaflet. From a nutritional viewpoint, it\nis important to know that cholesterol is not present in plants.\nLipids can be separated from one another and quantified\nby techniques such as column, thin-layer, and gas-liquid chro-\nmatography and their structures established by mass spec-\ntrometry and other techniques (see Chapter 4).\nMembrane Lipids Are Amphipathic\nAll major lipids in membranes contain both hydrophobic and\nhy\ndrophilic regions and are therefore termed amphipathic . If\nthe hydrophobic region were separated from the rest of the\nmolecule, it would be insoluble in water but soluble in organic\nsolvents. Conversely, if the hydrophilic region were sepa-\nrated from the rest of the molecule, it would be insoluble in\norganic solvents but soluble in water. The amphipathic nature\nof a phospholipid is represented in Figure 40\u20133 and also\nFigure 21\u201324.

As the number of double bonds within\nthe lipid side chains increase, the number of kinks in the tails\nincreases. As a consequence, the membrane lipids become less\ntightly packed and the membrane more fluid. The problem\ncaused by the presence of trans fatty acids in membrane lipids\nis described in Chapter 21.\nDetergents are amphipathic molecules that are important\nin biochemistry as well as in the household. The molecular\nstructure of a detergent is not unlike that of a phospholipid.\nCertain detergents are widely used to solubilize and purify\nmembrane proteins. The hydrophobic end of the detergent\nbinds to hydrophobic regions of the proteins, displacing most\nof their bound lipids. The polar end of the detergent is free,\nbringing the proteins into solution as detergent-protein com-\nplexes, usually also containing some residual lipids.\nMembrane Lipids Form Bilayers\nThe amphipathic character of phospholipids suggests that the\ntwo\n regions of the molecule have incompatible solubilities.\nHowever, in a solvent such as water, phospholipids spontane-\nously organize themselves into micelles (Figure 40\u20134 and\nFigure 21\u201324), an assembly that thermodynamically satis-\nfies the solubility requirements of the two chemically distinct\nregions of these molecules. Within the micelle the hydropho-\nbic regions of the amphipathic phospholipids are shielded from\nwater, while the hydrophilic polar groups are immersed in the\naqueous environment. Micelles are usually relatively small in\nsize (eg, ~200 nm) and consequently are limited in their poten-\ntial to form membranes. Detergents commonly form micelles.Phospholipids and similar amphipathic molecules can\nform another structure, the bimolecular lipid bilayer , which\nalso satisfies the thermodynamic requirements of amphipa-\nthic molecules in an aqueous environment. Bilayers are the\nkey structures in biologic membranes. Bilayers exist as sheets\nwherein the hydrophobic regions of the phospholipids are\nsequestered from the aqueous environment, while the hydro-\nphilic, charged portions are exposed to water ( Figure 40\u20135\nand Figure 21\u201324). The ends or edges of the bilayer sheet can\nbe eliminated by folding the sheet back on itself to form an\nenclosed vesicle with no edges. The closed bilayer provides\none of the most essential properties of membranes. The lipid\nbilayer is impermeable to most water-soluble molecules\nsince such charged molecules would be insoluble in the hydro-\nphobic core of the bilayer. The self-assembly of lipid bilay-\nersis driven by the hydrophobic effect , which describes the\ntendency of nonpolar molecules to self-associate in an aque-\nous environment, while in the process excluding H2O. When\nlipid molecules \ncome together in a bilayer, the entropy of the\nsurrounding solvent molecules increases due to the release of\nimmobilized water.\nTwo questions arise from consideration of the informa-\ntion described earlier. First, how many biologically important\nmolecules are lipid-soluble and can therefore readily enter\nthe cell? Gases such as oxygen, CO2, and nitrogen\u2014small\nmolecules \nwith little interaction with solvents\u2014readily dif-\nfuse through the hydrophobic regions of the membrane. The\npermeability coefficients of several ions and a number of\nother molecules in a lipid bilayer are shown in Figure 40\u20136 .\nThe electrolytes Na+, K+, and Cl\u2212cross the b ilayer much more\nslowly than water. In general, the permeability coefficients of\nsmall molecules in a lipid bilayer correlate with their solubili-\nties in nonpolar solvents . For instance, steroids more read-\nily traverse the lipid bilayer compared with electrolytes. The\nhigh permeability coefficient of water itself is surprising, but\nis partly explained by its small size and relative lack of charge.\nMany drugs are hydrophobic and can readily cross mem-\nbranes and enter cells.\nThe second question concerns non\u2013lipid-soluble mole-\ncules . How are the transmembrane concentration gradients for\nthese molecules maintained? The answer is that membranesFIGURE 40\u20134 Diagrammatic cross-section of a micelle.

These\nproteins either form channels for the movement of ions and\nsmall molecules or serve as transporters for molecules that oth-\nerwise could not readily traverse the lipid bilayer (membrane).\nThe nature, properties, and structures of membrane channels\nand transporters are described later.\nMembrane Proteins Are Associated\nWith \nthe Lipid Bilayer\nMembrane phosp holipids act as a solvent for membrane\nproteins, creating an environment in which the latter can\nfunction. As described in Chapter 5, the \u03b1 -helical structure\nof proteins minimizes the hydrophilic character of the pep-\ntide bonds themselves. Thus, proteins can be amphipathic\nand form an integral part of the membrane by having hydro-\nphilic regions protruding at the inside and outside faces of\nthe membrane but connected by a hydrophobic region tra-\nversing the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. In fact, those\nportions of membrane proteins that traverse membranes do\ncontain substantial numbers of hydrophobic amino acids\nand almost invariably have a high \u03b1-helical content. For most\nmembranes, a stretch of ~20 amino acids in an \u03b1-helical con-\nfiguration will span the lipid bilayer (see Figure 5\u20132).\nIt is possible to calculate whether a particular sequence of\namino acids present in a protein is consistent with a trans-\nmembrane location . This can be done by consulting a table\nthat lists the hydrophobicities of each of the 20 common\namino acids and the free energy values for their transfer from\nthe interior of a membrane to water. Hydrophobic amino\nacids have positive values; polar amino acids have negative\nvalues. The total free energy values for transferring successive\nsequences of 20 amino acids in the protein are plotted, yield-\ning a so-called hydropathy plot . Values of over 20 kcal mol\u22121\nare \nconsistent with\u2014but do not prove\u2014the interpretation that\nthe hydrophobic sequence is a transmembrane segment.\nAnother aspect of the interaction of lipids and proteins is\nthat some proteins are anchored to one leaflet of the bilayer\nby covalent linkages to certain lipids; this process is termed\nprotein lipidation . Lipidation can occur at protein termini\n(N- or C-) or internally. Common protein lipidation events\nare C-terminal protein isoprenylation, cholesterylation ,and glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI; see Figure 46\u20131);\nN-terminal protein myristoylation and internal cysteine\nS-prenylation andS-acylation . Such lipidation only occurs\non a specific subset of proteins and typically plays key roles\nin their biology.\nDifferent Membranes Have Different\nProtein \nCompositions\nThenumber of different proteins in a membrane varies from\nless than a dozen very abundant proteins in the sarcoplasmic\nreticulum of muscle cells to hundreds in plasma membranes.\nProteins are the major functional molecules of membranes\nand consist of enzymes, pumps andtransporters, channels,\nstructural components, antigens (eg, for histocompatibility),\nandreceptors for various molecules. Because every type of\nmembrane possesses a different complement of proteins, there\nis no such thing as a typical membrane structure. The enzymes\nassociated with several different membranes are shown in\nTable 40\u20132 .\nMembranes Are Dynamic Structures\nMembranes and their components are dynamic structures .\nMem\nbrane lipids and proteins undergo turnover, just as they\ndo in other compartments of the cell. Different lipids have dif-\nferent turnover rates, and the turnover rates of individual spe-\ncies of membrane proteins may vary widely. In some instances,\nthe membrane itself can turn over even more rapidly than any\nof its constituents. This is discussed in more detail in the sec-\ntion on endocytosis.\nAnother indicator of the dynamic nature of membranes\nis that a variety of studies have shown that lipids and certain\nproteins exhibit lateral diffusion in the plane of their mem-\nbranes. Many nonmobile proteins do not exhibit lateral dif-\nfusion because they are anchored to the underlying actin\ncytoskeleton.

An\ninside-outside asymmetry is also provided by the external\nlocation of the carbohydrates attached to membrane proteins.\nIn addition, specific proteins are located exclusively on the\noutsides or insides of membranes.\nThere are also regional heterogeneities in membranes.\nSome, such as occur at the villous borders of mucosal cells,\nare almost macroscopically visible. Others, such as those at\ngap junctions, tight junctions, and synapses, occupy much\nsmaller regions of the membrane and generate correspond-\ningly smaller local asymmetries.\nThere is also inside-outside asymmetry of the phos-\npholipids . The choline-containing phospholipids (phos-\nphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) are located mainly in\ntheouter leaflet ; the aminophospholipids (phosphatidyl-\nserine and phosphatidylethanolamine) are preferentially\nlocated in the inner leaflet . Obviously, if this lipid asym-\nmetry is to exist at all, there must be limited transverse\nmobility , or \u201cflip-flop\u201d the membrane phospholipids. In\nfact, phospholipids in synthetic bilayers exhibit an extraor-\ndinarily slow rate of flip-flop; the half-life of the asymmetry\nin these synthetic bilayers is on the order of several weeks.\nThe mechanisms involved in the lipid asymmetry are\nnot well understood. The enzymes involved in the synthe-\nsis of phospholipids are located on the cytoplasmic side ofmicrosomal membrane vesicles. Translocases (flippases) exist\nthat transfer certain phospholipids (eg, phosphatidylcholine)\nfrom the inner to the outer leaflet. Specific proteins that pref-\nerentially bind individual phospholipids also appear to be\npresent in the two leaflets; thus, lipid binding also contributes\nto the asymmetric distribution of specific lipid molecules. In\naddition, phospholipid exchange proteins recognize certain\nphospholipids and transfer them from one membrane (eg, the\nER) to others (eg, mitochondrial and peroxisomal). A related\nissue is how lipids enter membranes. This has not been studied\nas intensively as the topic of how proteins enter membranes\n(see Chapter 49) and knowledge is still relatively meager.\nMany membrane lipids are synthesized in the ER. At least\nthree pathways have been recognized: (1) transport from the\nER in vesicles, which then transfer the contained lipids to the\nrecipient membrane; (2) entry via direct contact of one mem-\nbrane (eg, the ER) with another, facilitated by specific proteins;\nand (3) transport via the phospholipid exchange proteins (also\nknown as lipid transfer proteins) mentioned earlier, which\nonly exchanges lipids, but does not cause net transfer.\nThere is further asymmetry with regard to GSLs and gly-\ncoproteins ; the sugar moieties of these molecules all protrude\noutward from the plasma membrane and are absent from its\ninner face.\nMembranes Contain Integral &\nPeripher\nal Proteins\nIt is useful to classify membrane proteins into two types: inte-\ngral and peripheral (Figure \n40\u20137 ).

Also, they generally span\nthe bilayer as a bundle of \u03b1-helical transmembrane segments.\nIntegral proteins are usually globular and are themselves\namphipathic. They consist of two hydrophilic ends sepa-\nrated by an intervening hydrophobic region that traverses the\nhydrophobic core of the bilayer. As the structures of integral\nmembrane proteins were being elucidated, it became apparent\nthat certain ones (eg, transporter molecules, ion channels, var-\nious receptors, and G proteins) span the bilayer many times,\nwhereas other simple membrane proteins (eg, glycophorin A)\nspan the membrane only once (see Figures 42\u20134 and 52\u20135).\nIntegral proteins are asymmetrically distributed across the\nmembrane bilayer. This asymmetric orientation is conferred\nat the time of their insertion in the lipid bilayer during biosyn-\nthesis in the ER. The molecular mechanisms involved in inser-\ntion of proteins into membranes and the topic of membrane\nassembly are discussed in Chapter 49.\nPeripheral proteins do not interact directly with the hydro-\nphobic cores of the phospholipids in the bilayer and thus do not\nrequire use of detergents for their release. They are bound to the\nhydrophilic regions of specific integral proteins and head groups\nof phospholipids and can be released from them by treatment\nwith salt solutions of high ionic strength. For example, ankyrin,\na peripheral protein, is bound to the inner aspect of the inte-\ngral protein \u201cband 3\u201d of the erythrocyte membrane. Spectrin, a\ncytoskeletal structure within the erythrocyte, is in turn bound to\nankyrin and thereby plays an important role in maintenance of\nthe biconcave shape of the erythrocyte (see Figure 53\u20136).\nARTIFICIAL MEMBRANES MODEL\nMEMBRANE \nFUNCTION\nArtificial membrane systems can be prepared by appropriate\ntechniques. \nThese systems generally consist of mixtures of one\nor more phospholipids of natural or synthetic origin that have\nbeen treated by using mild sonication to induce the forma-\ntion of spherical vesicles in which the lipids form a bilayer.\nSuch vesicles, surrounded by a lipid bilayer with an aqueous\ninterior, are termed liposomes (see Figure 21\u201324).\nThe advantages and uses of artificial membrane systems\nfor the biochemical study of membrane function are as follows:\n1.Thelipid content of the membranes can be varied, allow-\ning systematic examination of the effects of varying lipid\ncomposition on certain functions.\n2.Purified membrane proteins or enzymes can be incorpo-\nrated into these vesicles in order to assess what factors (eg,\nspecific lipids or ancillary proteins) the proteins require to\nreconstitute their function.\n3.Theenvironment of these systems can be rigidly controlled\nand systematically varied (eg, ion concentrations and ligands).\n4.When liposomes are formed, they can be made to entrap\ncertain compounds within the vesicle such as drugs and\nisolated genes. There is interest in using liposomes todistribute drugs to certain tissues, and if components (eg,\nantibodies to certain cell surface molecules) could be incor-\nporated into liposomes so that they would be targeted to\nspecific tissues or tumors, the therapeutic impact would be\nconsiderable. DNA entrapped inside liposomes appears to\nbe less sensitive to attack by nucleases; this approach may\nprove useful in attempts at gene therapy .\nTHE FLUID MOSAIC MODEL\nOF \nMEMBRANE STRUCTURE IS\nWIDELY ACCEPTED\nThefluid mosaic model of membrane structure proposed in\n1972 by Singer and Nicolson (see Figure 40\u20137) is now widely\naccepted. The model is often likened to integral membrane\nprotein \u201cicebergs\u201d floating in a sea of (predominantly) fluid\nphospholipid molecules. Early evidence for the model was the\nfinding that well characterized, fluorescently labeled integral\nmembrane proteins could be seen microscopically to rapidly and\nrandomly redistribute within the plasma membrane of a hybrid\ncell formed by the artificial fusion of two different (mouse and\nhuman) parent cells (one labeled the other not). It has subse-\nquently been demonstrated that phospholipids undergo even\nmore rapid lateral diffusion with subsequent redistribution\nwithin the plane of the membrane. Measurements indicate that\nwithin the plane of the membrane, one molecule of phospho-\nlipid can move several micrometers per second.\nThephase changes \u2014and thus the fluidity of membranes\u2014\nare largely dependent on the lipid composition of the membrane.\nIn a lipid bilayer, the hydrophobic chains of the fatty acids can be\nhighly aligned or ordered to provide a rather stiff structure. As\nthe temperature increases, the hydrophobic side chains undergo\natransition from the ordered state (more gel-like or crystalline\nphase) to a disordered one, taking on a more liquid-like or fluid\narrangement. The temperature at which membrane structure\nundergoes the transition from ordered to disordered (ie, melts) is\ncalled the \u201c transition temperature \u201d (Tm). Longer and more satu-\nra\nted fatty acid chains interact more strongly with each other via\ntheir extended hydrocarbon chains and thus cause higher values\nofTm\u2014that is, higher temperatures are required to increase the\nfl\nuidity of the bilayer. On the other hand, unsaturated bonds that\nexist in the cisconfiguration tend to increase the fluidity of a\nbilayer by decreasing compactness of the side chain packing with-\nout diminishing hydrophobicity (see Figures 40\u20133 and 40\u20135).\nThe phospholipids of cellular membranes generally contain at\nleast one unsaturated fatty acid with at least one cisdouble bond.\nCholesterol acts as a buffer to modify the fluidity of mem-\nbranes. At temperatures below the Tm, it interferes with the\ninteraction \nof the hydrocarbon tails of fatty acids and thus\nincreases fluidity. At temperatures above the Tm, it limits dis-\norder \nbecause it is more rigid than the hydrocarbon tails of\nthe fatty acids and cannot move in the membrane to the same\nextent, thus limiting, or \u201cbuffering\u201d membrane fluidity.\nThe fluidity of a membrane significantly affects its func-\ntions. As membrane fluidity increases, so does its permeability"

The insulin receptor (see Figure 42\u20138) is an\nexcellent example of altered function with changes in fluidity.\nAs the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in the mem-\nbrane is increased (by growing cultured cells in a medium rich\nin such molecules), fluidity increases. Increased fluidity alters\nthe receptor such that it binds insulin more effectively. At nor-\nmal body temperature (37\u00b0C), the lipid bilayer is in a fluid\nstate.

They have been\nhypothesized to be involved in signal transduction and other\nprocesses. It is thought that clustering certain components of\nsignaling systems closely together may increase the efficiency\nof their function.\nCaveolae may derive from lipid rafts. Many, if not all,\ncontain the protein caveolin-1 , which may be involved intheir formation from rafts. Caveolae are observable by elec-\ntron microscopy as flask, or tube-shaped indentations of the\ncell membrane into the cytosol ( Figure 40\u20139 ), and likely play\na role in endocytosis (cellular uptake of various components).\nProteins detected in caveolae include various components\nof the signal transduction system (eg, the insulin receptor\nand some G proteins; see Chapter 42), the folate receptor,\nand endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Caveolae and\nlipid rafts are active areas of research, and ideas concerning\nthem and their roles in various biologic processes are rapidly\nevolving.\nTight junctions are other structures found in surface\nmembranes. They are often located below the apical surfaces\nof epithelial cells and prevent the diffusion of macromolecules\nbetween cells. They are composed of various proteins, including\noccludin, various claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules.\nYet other specialized structures found in surface mem-\nbranes include desmosomes, adherens junctions , and micro-\nvilli; their chemical natures and functions are not discussed\nhere.

Solubility is inversely proportional to the\nnum\nber of hydrogen bonds that must be broken in order for a\nsolute in the external aqueous phase to become incorporated\nin the hydrophobic bilayer. Electrolytes, poorly soluble in lipid,\ndo not form hydrogen bonds with water, but they do acquire a\nshell of water from hydration by electrostatic interaction. The\nsize of the shell is directly proportional to the charge density of\nthe electrolyte. Electrolytes with a large charge density have a\nlarger shell of hydration and thus a slower diffusion rate. Na+,\nfor \nexample, has a higher charge density than K+. Hydrated\nNa+is therefore larger than hydrated K+; hence, the latter tends\nto mo\nve more easily through the membrane.\nThe following affect net diffusion of a substance: (1) concen-\ntration gradient across the membrane\u2014solutes move from high\nto low concentration; (2) electrical potential across the mem-\nbrane: solutes move toward the solution that has the opposite\ncharge. The inside of the cell usually has a net negative charge;\n(3) permeability coefficient of the substance for the membrane;\n(4) hydrostatic pressure gradient across the membrane: increased\npressure will increase the rate and force of the collision between\nthe molecules and the membrane; and (5) temperature, since\nincreased temperature will increase particle motion and thus\nincrease the frequency of collisions between external particles\nand the membrane.\nFacilitated diffusion involves either certain transporters\nor ion channels ( Figure 40\u201311 ). Active transport is mediated\nby other transporters most of which are ATP-driven. A multi-\ntude of transporters and channels exist in biologic membranes\nthat route the entry of ions into and out of cells. Table 40\u20134\nsummarizes some important differences between transporters\nand ion channels.\nTransporters Are Specific Proteins\nInv\nolved in Facilitated Diffusion & Also\nActive Transport\nTransport systems can be described in a functional sense\nacc\nording to the number of molecules moved and the direction\nof movement ( Figure 40\u201312 ) or according to whether move-\nment is toward or away from equilibrium. The following clas-\nsification depends primarily on the former. A uniport system\nmoves one type of molecule bidirectionally. In cotransport sys-\ntems, the transfer of one solute depends on the stoichiometricsimultaneous or sequential transfer of another solute. A sym-\nport moves two solutes in the same direction. Examples are the\nproton-sugar transporter in bacteria and the Na+-sugar trans-\nport\ners (for glucose and certain other sugars) and Na+-amino\nacid\n transporters in mammalian cells. Antiport systems move\ntwo molecules in opposite directions (eg, Na+in and Ca2+ou t).\nHydrophilic molecules that cannot pass freely through the\nlipid bilayer membrane do so passively by facilitated diffusion\nor by active transport . Passive transport is driven by the trans-\nmembrane gradient of substrate. Active transport always occurs\nagainst an electrical or chemical gradient, and so it requires\nenergy, usually in the form of ATP . Both types of transport involve\nspecific carrier proteins (transporters) and both show specific-\nityfor ions, sugars, and amino acids. Passive and active transports\nresemble a substrate-enzyme interaction. Points of resemblance\nof both to enzyme action are as follows: (1) There is a specific\nbinding site for the solute. (2) The carrier is saturable, so it has a\nmaximum rate of transport ( Vmax;Fi gure 40\u201313 ). (3) There is a\nbinding constant ( Km) for the solute, and so the whole system has\naKm(F igure 40\u201313). (4) Structurally similar competitive inhibi-\ntors block transport. Transporters are thus like enzymes, but gen-\nerally do not modify their substrates.\nCotransporters use the gradient of one substrate created by\nactive transport to drive the movement of the other substrate.\nMembrane transport of\nsmall \nmolecules\nActive\nvia mainly ATP-driven\ntransporters (pumps)Passive\nVia ion channels Via various\ntransportersSimple diffusion Facilitated\nFIGURE 40\u201311 A schematic diagram of the two types of\nmembrane \ntransport of small molecules.TABLE 40\u20134 Comparison of Transporters & Ion Channels\nTransporters Ion Channels\nBind \nsolute and undergo\nconformational changes,\ntransferring the solute across\nthe membraneForm pores in membranes\nInvolved in passive (facilitated\ndiffusion) and active transportInvolved only in passive\ntransport\nTransport is significantly slower\nthan via ion channelsTransport is significantly faster\nthan via transporters\nNote : T ransporters are also known as carriers or permeases.

The\nATPase is a very important example of primary transport ,\nwhile the Na+-dependent systems are examples of secon dary\ntransport that rely on the gradient produced by another system.\nThus, inhibition of the Na+-K+-ATPase in cells also blocks the\nN\na+-dependent uptake of substances like glucose.\nFacilitated Diffusion Is Mediated by a\nV\nariety of Specific Transporters\nSome specific solutes diffuse down electrochemical gradi-\nents across membranes more rapidly than mi\nght be expected\nfrom their size, charge, or partition coefficient. This is because\nspecific transporters are involved. This facilitated diffusionexhibits properties distinct from those of simple diffusion.\nThe rate of facilitated diffusion, a uniport system, can be satu-\nrated; that is, the number of sites involved in diffusion of the\nspecific solutes appears finite. Many facilitated diffusion sys-\ntems are stereospecific but, like simple diffusion, are driven by\nthe transmembrane electrochemical gradient.\nA\u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism (Figure 40\u201314 ) helps to\nexplain facilitated diffusion. In this model, the carrier pro-\ntein exists in two principal conformations. In the \u201c ping \u201d\nstate, it is exposed to high concentrations of solute, and mol-\necules of the solute bind to specific sites on the carrier pro-\ntein. Binding induces a conformational change that exposes\nthe carrier to a lower concentration of solute (\u201c pong \u201d state).\nThis process is completely reversible, and net flux across\nthe membrane depends on the concentration gradient. The\nrate at which solutes enter a cell by facilitated diffusion is\ndetermined by (1) the concentration gradient across the\nmembrane; (2) the amount of carrier available (this is a key\ncontrol step); (3) the affinity of the solute-carrier interaction;\n(4) the rapidity of the conformational change for both the\nloaded and the unloaded carrier.\nHormones can regulate facilitated diffusion by changing\nthe number of transporters available. Insulin via a complex sig-\nnaling pathway increases glucose transport in fat and muscle by\nrecruiting glucose transporters (GLUT) from an intracellular\nreservoir. Insulin also enhances amino acid transport in liver\nand other tissues. One of the coordinated actions of glucocorti-\ncoid hormones is to enhance transport of amino acids into liver,\nwhere the amino acids then serve as a substrate for gluconeo-\ngenesis. Growth hormone increases amino acid transport in all\ncells, and estrogens do this in the uterus. There are at least five\ndifferent carrier systems for amino acids in animal cells. Each\nis specific for a group of closely related amino acids, and most\noperate as Na+-symport systems (see Figure 40\u201312).KmVmax\nSolute concentrationCarrier-mediated\ndiffusionPassive\ndiffusion% Maximal rate100\n50\nFIGURE 40\u201313 A comparison of the kinetics of carrier-\nmediated \n(facilitated) diffusion with passive diffusion.

Cation-conductive channels have an average\ndiameter of about 5 to 8 nm. The permeability of a channel\ndepends on the size, the extent of hydration, and the extent of\ncharge density on the ion. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+,\nand \nCl\u2212have been identified. The functional \u03b1 subunit of a\nNa+channel is schematically illustra ted in Figure 40\u201315 . The\n\u03b1 subunit is composed of four domains (I-IV) each of which\nis formed by six contiguous transmembrane \u03b1-helices; each\nof these domains is connected by variable-length intra- and\nextracellular loops. The amino- and carboxy termini of the \u03b1\nsubunit are located in the cytoplasm. The actual pore in the\nchannel through which Na+ions pass is formed by interac-\ntions between the four domains, generating a tertiary struc-\nture by interactions between the four sets of 5,6 \u03b1-helices of\ndomains I to IV . Na+channels are often voltage sensitive or\ngated ; the voltage sensor of the channel is formed through the\ninteraction domain I to IV , the four \u03b1-helices-4 formed when\ndomains I to IV interact. This ~5 to 8 nm pore constitutes the\ncenter of the tertiary channel structure.\nIon channels are very selective , in most cases permit-\nting the passage of only one type of ion (Na+, Ca2+, etc.). The\nselec\ntivity filter of K+channels is made up of a ring of car-\nbonyl groups donated by the subunits. The carbonyls displace\nbound water from the ion, and thus restrict its size to appro-\npriate precise dimensions for passage through the channel.Many variations on the structural theme described earlier for\nthe Na+channel have been described. However, all ion chan-\nnels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that\ncome together to form a central pore through which ions pass\nselectively.\nThe membranes of nerve cells contain well-studied ion\nchannels that are responsible for the generation of action\npotentials. The activity of some of these channels is controlled\nby neurotransmitters; hence, channel activity can be regulated.\nIon channels are open transiently and thus are \u201c gated .\u201d\nGates can be controlled by opening or closing. In ligand-\ngated channels , a specific molecule binds to a receptor and\nopens the channel. Voltage-gated channels open (or close)\nin response to changes in membrane potential. Mechanically\ngated channels respond to mechanical stimuli (pressure\nand touch). Some properties of ion channels are listed in\nTables 40\u20134 and 40\u20135 .\nDetailed Studies of a K+Channel & of a\nVoltage-Gated Channel Have Yielded\nMajor Insights Into Their Actions\nThere are at least four features of ion channels that must be\nelucida\nted: (1) their overall structures; (2) how they conduct\nions so rapidly; (3) their selectivity; and (4) their gating prop-\nerties. As described later, considerable progress in tackling\nthese difficult problems has been made.\nTheK+channel (K vAP) is an integral membrane protein\ncomposed of four identical subunits, each with two trans-\nmembrane segments, creating an inverted \u201cV\u201d-like structure\n(Figure 40\u201316 ).

This channel is made\nup of four subunits, each with six transmembrane segments.\nOne of the six segments (S4 and part of S3) is the voltage\nsensor. It behaves like a charged paddle (Figure 40\u201317 ), in\nthat it can move through the interior of the membrane trans-\nferring four positive charges (due to four Arg residues in each\nsubunit) from one membrane surface to the other in responseto changes in voltage. There are four voltage sensors in each\nchannel, linked to the gate.

Ionophores contain hydrophilic centers that are\nsurrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Specific ions\nbind within the hydrophilic center of the molecule, which\nthen diffuses through the membrane efficiently delivering the\nion in question to the cytosol.

In\nessence, the pores are too narrow to permit passage of ions.\nProtons are excluded by the fact that the oxygen atom of\nwater binds to two asparagine residues lining the channel,\nmaking the water unavailable to participate in an H+relay ,\nand thus preventing entry of protons.

This energy can come from the\nhydrolysis of ATP , from electron movement, or from light. The\nmaintenance of electrochemical gradients in biologic sys-\ntems is so important that it consumes approximately 30% of\nthe total energy expenditure in the cell .\nAs shown in Table 40\u20136 ,four major classes of ATP-driven\nactive transporters (P,F,V, and ABC transporters) have been\nrecognized. The nomenclature is explained in the legend to the\ntable. The first example of the P class, the Na+-K+-ATPase,\nis \ndiscussed later. The Ca2+A TPase of muscle is discussed in\nChapter 51. The second class is referred to as F-type. The\nmost important example of this class is the mt ATP synthase,\ndescribed in Chapter 13. V-type active transporters pump pro-\ntons into lysosomes and other structures. ABC transporters\ninclude the CFTR protein, a chloride channel involved in the\ncausation of cystic fibrosis (described later in this chapter and in\nChapter 58). Another important member of this class is the mul-\ntidrug-resistance-1 protein ( MDR-1 protein). This transporterwill pump a variety of drugs, including many anticancer agents,\nout of cells. It is a very important cause of cancer cells exhibiting\nresistance to chemotherapy, although many other mechanisms\nare also implicated (see Chapter 56).\nThe Na+-K+-ATPase of the Plasma\nMe\nmbrane Is a Key Enzyme in Regulating\nIntracellular Concentrations of Na+& K+\nAs shown in Table 40\u20131, cells maintain a low intracellular Na+\nconcentra\ntion and a high intracellular K+concen tration, along\nwith a net negative electrical potential inside.

This\npump is an integral membrane protein that contains a trans-\nmembrane domain allowing the passage of ions, and cytosolic\ndomains that couple ATP hydrolysis to transport. There are\ncatalytic centers for both ATP and Na+on the cytoplasmic\n(inner) side of the plasma membrane (PM), while there are\nK+\u2212binding sites located on the extracellular side of the mem-\nbrane\n. Phosphorylation by ATP induces a conformational\nchange in the protein leading to the transfer of three Na+ions\nfrom \nthe inner to the outer side of the plasma membrane. Two\nmolecules of K+bind to sites on the protein on the external\nsurface of the cell membrane, resulting in dephosphorylation\nof the protein and transfer of the K+ions across the membrane\nto the interior. Thus, three Na+ions are transported out for\nevery two K+ions entering. This differential ion transport cre-\nates a charge imbalance between the inside and the outside of\nthe cell, making the cell interior more negative (an electro-\ngenic effect). Two clinically important cardiac drugs ouabain\nand digitalis, inhibit the Na+-K+-ATPase by binding to the\nextracellular \ndomain. This enzyme can consume significant\namounts of cellular ATP energy. The Na+-K+-ATPase can be\ncoup\nled to various other transporters, such as those involved\nin transport of glucose (see later).\nTABLE 40\u20136 Major Types of ATP-Driven Active\nT\nransporters\nType Example With Subcellular Location\nP-type\nCa2+A TPase (SR); Na+-K+-ATPase (PM)\nF-type\nmt ATP synthase of oxidative\nphosphorylation\nV-type The ATPase that pumps protons into\nlysosomes and synaptic vesicles\nABC transporter CFTR protein (PM); MDR-1 protein (PM)\nAbbreviations: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein, a Cl\u2013trans-\nporter\n, and the protein implicated in the causation of cystic fibrosis (see later in this\nchapter); MDR-1 protein (multidrug-resistance-1 protein), a protein that pumps many\nchemotherapeutic agents out of cancer cells and is thus an important contributor\nto the resistance of certain cancer cells to treatment; mt, mitochondrial; PM, plasma\nmembrane; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle.\nP (in P-type) signifies phosphorylation (these proteins autophosphorylate).\nF (in F-type) signifies energy coupling factors.\nV (in V-type) signifies vacuolar.\nABC signifies ATP-binding cassette transporter (all have two nucleotide-binding\ndomains and two transmembrane segments).Membrane\nATP\nADP\n+\nPiInside\n3 Na+\nMg2+\n2 K+2 K+3 Na+Outside\nFIGURE 40\u201318 Stoichiometry of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump.\nThis \npump moves three Na+ions from inside the cell to the outside\nand brings two K+ions from the outside to the inside for every mol-\necule of ATP hydrolyzed to ADP by the membrane-associated ATPase.\nOuabain and other cardiac glycosides inhibit this pump by acting on\nthe extracellular surface of the membrane.

When appropriately stimulated by a chemical signal medi-\nated by a specific synaptic membrane receptor (see discussion\nof the transmission of biochemical signals, later), channels in\nthe membrane are opened to allow the rapid influx of Na+or\nCa2+(wi th or without the efflux of K+), so that the voltage dif-\nfer\nence rapidly collapses, and that segment of the membrane is\ndepolarized . However, as a result of the action of the ion pumps\nin the membrane, the gradient is quickly restored.\nWhen large areas of the membrane are depolarized in this\nmanner, the electrochemical disturbance propagates in wave-\nlike form down the membrane, generating a nerve impulse .\nMyelin sheets, formed by Schwann cells, wrap around nerve\nfibers and provide an electrical insulator that surrounds most\nof the nerve and greatly speeds up the propagation of the wave\n(signal) by allowing ions to flow in and out of the membrane\nonly where the membrane is free of the insulation (at the nodes\nof Ranvier ). The myelin membrane has a very high lipid con-\ntent that accounts for its excellent insulating property. Rela-\ntively few proteins are found in the myelin membrane; those\npresent appear to hold together multiple membrane bilayers\nto form the hydrophobic insulating structure that is imperme-\nable to ions and water. Certain diseases, for example, multiple\nsclerosis and the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, are characterized\nby demyelination and impaired nerve conduction.\nTRANSPORT OF GLUCOSE\nINVOL\nVES SEVERAL\nMECHANISMS\nA discussion of the transport of glucose summarizes many of\nthe \npoints discussed earlier. Glucose must enter cells as the first\nstep in energy utilization. A number of different glucose trans-\nporters (GLUTs) are involved, varying in different tissues (see\nTable 19\u20132). In adipocytes and skeletal muscle, glucose enters\nby a specific transport system (GLUT4) that is enhanced by\ninsulin. Changes in transport are primarily due to alterations\nofVmax(presum ably from more or fewer transporters), but\nchanges in Kmmay also be involved.\nGlucose transport in the small intestine involves some dif-\nferent aspects of the principles of transport discussed earlier.\nGlucose and Na+bind to different sites on a Na+-glucose sym-\nporter located \nat the apical surface . Na+moves into the cell\ndown its electrochemical gradient and \u201cdrags\u201d glucose with it\n(Figure 40\u201319 ). Therefore, the greater the Na+gradient, the\nmore glucose enters; and if Na+in extracellular fluid is low,\nglucose transport stops. To maintain a steep Na+gradient, this\nNa+-glucose symporter is dependent on gradients generated\nby \nthe Na+-K+-ATPase, which maintains a low intracellularNa+concen tration. Similar mechanisms are used to transport\nother sugars as well as amino acids across the apical lumen in\npolarized cells such as are found in the intestine and kidney.\nThe transcellular movement of glucose in this case involves\none additional component, a uniport (see Figure 40\u201319) that\nallows the glucose accumulated within the cell to move across\nthebasolateral membrane and involves a glucose uniporter\n(GLUT2).\nThe treatment of severe cases of diarrhea (such as is found\nin cholera) makes use of the above information. In cholera\n(see Chapter 57), massive amounts of fluid can be passed as\nwatery stools in a very short time, resulting in severe dehydra-\ntion and possibly death. Oral rehydration therapy , consist-\ning primarily of NaCl and glucose , has been developed by the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO). The transport of glucose\nand Na+across the intestinal epithelium forces (via osmosis)\nmovement of water from the lumen of the gut into intestinal\ncells, resulting in rehydration. Glucose alone or NaCl alone\nwould not be effective.\nCELLS TRANSPORT CERTAIN\nMACR\nOMOLECULES ACROSS\nTHE PLASMA MEMBRANE BY\nENDOCYTOSIS & EXOCYTOSIS\nThe process by which cells take up large molecules is called\nendoc\nytosis . Some of these molecules, when hydrolyzed\ninside the cell, yield nutrients (eg, polysaccharides, proteins,\nand polynucleotides).

Endocytosis can\nbe \nused to learn more about how cells function. DNA from\none cell type can be used to transfect a different cell and alter\nthe latter\u2019s function or phenotype. A specific gene is often\nemployed in these experiments, and this provides a unique\nway to study and analyze the regulation of that gene. DNA\ntransfection depends on endocytosis, which is responsible for\nthe entry of DNA into the cell. Such experiments commonly\nuse calcium phosphate since Ca2+stimula tes endocytosis and\nprecipitates DNA, which makes the DNA a better object for\nendocytosis (see Chapter 39). Cells also release macromol-\necules byexocytosis . Endocytosis and exocytosis both involve\nvesicle formation with or from the plasma membrane.\nEndocytosis Involves Ingestion of Parts\nof \nthe Plasma Membrane\nAlmost all eukaryotic cells are continuously recycling parts of\ntheir \nplasma membranes. Endocytotic vesicles are generated\nwhen segments of the plasma membrane invaginate, enclos-\ning a small volume of extracellular fluid and its contents. The\nvesicle then pinches off as the fusion of plasma membranes\nseals the neck of the vesicle at the original site of invagina-\ntion ( Figure 40\u201320 ). The bilayer lipid membrane, or vesicle\nso generated, then fuses with other membrane structures andthus achieves the transport of its contents to other cellular\ncompartments or even back to the cell exterior. Most endo-\ncytotic vesicles fuse with primary lysosomes to form second-\nary lysosomes , which contain hydrolytic enzymes and are\ntherefore specialized organelles for intracellular disposal. The\nmacromolecular contents are digested to yield amino acids,\nsimple sugars, or nucleotides, which are transported out of\nthe vesicles to be (re)used by the cell. Endocytosis requires\n(1) energy, usually from the hydrolysis of ATP; (2) Ca2+; and\n(3) cytoske\nletal elements in the cell (see Chapter 51).\nThere are two general types of endocytosis .Phagocyto-\nsisoccurs only in specialized cells such as macrophages and\ngranulocytes. Phagocytosis involves the ingestion of large par-\nticles such as viruses, bacteria, cells, or cellular debris. Mac-\nrophages are extremely active in this regard and may ingest\n25% of their volume per hour. In so doing, a macrophage may\ninternalize 3% of its plasma membrane each minute or the\nentire membrane every 30 minutes.\nPinocytosis (\u201ccell drinking\u201d) is a property of all cells and\nleads to the cellular uptake of fluid and fluid contents. There\nare two types of pinocytosis. Fluid-phase pinocytosis is a\nnonselective process in which the uptake of a solute by forma-\ntion of small vesicles is simply proportionate to its concentra-\ntion in the surrounding extracellular fluid. The formation of\nthese vesicles is an extremely active process. Fibroblasts, for\nexample, internalize their plasma membrane at about one-\nthird the rate of macrophages. This process occurs more rap-\nidly than membranes are made. The surface area and volume\nof a cell do not change much, so membranes must be replaced\nby exocytosis or by being recycled as fast as they are removed\nby endocytosis.\nThe other type of pinocytosis, absorptive pinocytosis or\nreceptor-mediated endocytosis , is primarily responsible for\nthe uptake of specific macromolecules for which there are\nbinding sites on the plasma membrane. These high-affinity\nreceptors permit the selective concentration of ligands from\nthe medium, minimize the uptake of fluid or soluble unbound\nmacromolecules, and markedly increase the rate at which\nspecific molecules enter the cell. The vesicles formed during\nabsorptive pinocytosis are derived from invaginations (pits)\nthat are coated on the cytoplasmic side with a filamentous\nmaterial and are appropriately named coated pits . In many\nsystems, the protein clathrin is the filamentous material. It\nhas a three-limbed structure (called a triskelion ), with each\nlimb being made up of one light and one heavy chain of clath-\nrin. The polymerization of clathrin into a vesicle is directed\nbyassembly particles , composed of four adapter proteins .\nThese interact with certain amino acid sequences in the recep-\ntors that become cargo, ensuring selectivity of uptake. The\nlipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)(see\nChapt\ner 21) also plays an important role in vesicle assem-\nbly. In addition, the protein dynamin , which both binds and\nhydrolyzes GTP , is necessary for the pinching off of clathrin-\ncoated vesicles from the cell surface. Coated pits may consti-\ntute as much as 2% of the surface of some cells. Other aspects\nof vesicles are discussed in Chapter 49.B A\nV\nCVCPExtracellular Sp\nace\nCytosol\nFIGURE 40\u201320 Two types of pinocytosis. An endocytotic\nvesicle (V) forms as a result of invagination of a portion of the plasma\nmembrane. Fluid-phase pinocytosis ( A) is random and nondirected.\nAbsorptive (receptor-mediated endocytosis) ( B) is selective and\noccurs in coated pits (CP) lined with the protein clathrin (the fuzzy\nmaterial). Targeting is provided by receptors ( brown symbols ) specific\nfor a variety of molecules. This results in the formation of an internalized\nclathrin-coated vesicle (CV)."

Endocy-\ntotic vesicles containing the LDL-bound LDL receptor com-\nplex fuse to lysosomes in the cell. The receptor is released\nand recycled back to the cell surface membrane, but the\napoprotein of LDL is degraded and the cholesteryl esters\nmetabolized. Synthesis of the LDL receptor is regulated by\nsecondary or tertiary consequences of pinocytosis, for exam-\nple, by metabolic products\u2014such as cholesterol\u2014released\nduring the degradation of LDL. Disorders of the LDL recep-\ntor and its internalization are medically important and are\ndiscussed in Chapters 25 and 26.\nAbsorptive pinocytosis of extracellular glycoproteins\nrequires that the glycoproteins carry specific carbohydrate\nrecognition signals. These recognition signals are bound by\nmembrane receptor molecules that play a role analogous to\nthat of the LDL receptor. A galactosyl receptor on the surface\nof hepatocytes is instrumental in the absorptive pinocytosis\nofasialoglycoproteins from the circulation (see Chapter 46).\nAcid hydrolases taken up by absorptive pinocytosis in fibro-\nblasts are recognized by their mannose-6-phosphate moi-\neties. Interestingly, the mannose-6-phosphate moiety also\nseems to play an important role in the intracellular targeting\nof the acid hydrolases to the lysosomes of the cells in which\nthey are synthesized.\nThere is a problematic side to receptor-mediated endo-\ncytosis in that viruses which cause such diseases as hepatitis\n(affecting liver cells), poliomyelitis (affecting motor neurons),\nAIDS (affecting T cells), and COVID-19 (affecting lung and\nother cell types), initiate their infectious cycles by entering\ncells via this mechanism. Iron toxicity also begins with exces-\nsive uptake due to endocytosis.\nExocytosis Releases Certain\nMacromolecules \nFrom Cells\nMost cells release macromolecules to the exterior by exocy-\ntosis . This \nprocess is also involved in membrane remodeling,\nwhen the components synthesized in the ER and Golgi are\ncarried in vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane. The\nsignal for this \u201cclassical exocytosis\u201d (see later) is often a hor-\nmone which, when it binds to a cell surface receptor, induces\na local and transient change in Ca2+concen tration. Ca2+trig-\ngers \nexocytosis. Figure 40\u201321 provides a comparison of the\nmechanisms of exocytosis and endocytosis.Molecules released by this mode of exocytosis have at least\nthree fates: (1) they are membrane proteins and remain asso-\nciated with the cell surface; (2) they can become part of the\nextracellular matrix, for example, collagen and glycosamino-\nglycans; (3) they can enter extracellular fluid and signal other\ncells. Insulin, parathyroid hormone, and the catecholamines\nare all packaged in granules and processed within cells, to be\nreleased on appropriate stimulation.\nVARIOUS SIGNALS CAN BE\nTRANSMITTED \nACROSS\nMEMBRANES\nSpecific biochemical signals such as neurotransmitters, hor-\nmones, \nand immunoglobulins bind to integral transmembrane\nreceptor proteins via their exposed extracellular domains,\nthereby transmitting information through the membranes to\nthe cytoplasm. This process, called transmembrane signaling\norsignal transduction , involves the generation of a number\nof second messenger signaling molecules, including cyclic\nnucleotides, calcium, phosphoinositides, and diacylglycerol\n(see Chapter 42). Many of the steps involve phosphorylation\nof receptors and downstream proteins.\nGAP JUNCTIONS ALLOW DIRECT\nFL\nOW OF MOLECULES FROM ONE\nCELL TO ANOTHER\nGap junctions are structures that permit direct transfer of\nsmall molecules (up to ~1200 Da) from one cell to its neighbor.\nGap junctions are composed of a family of proteins called con-\nnexins that form a bihexagonal structure consisting of 12 such\nproteins. Six connexins form a connexin hemichannel and join\nto a similar structure in a neighboring cell to make a complete,\nmembrane-spanning connexon channel (Figure 40\u201322 ). One\ngap junction contains several connexons. Different connexins\nare found in different tissues. Mutations in genes encoding\nconnexins have been found to be associated with a number of\nconditions, including cardiovascular abnormalities, one type\nof deafness, and the X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth\ndisease (a demyelinating neurologic disorder).\nEXTRACELLULAR VESICLES\n(EX\nOSOMES) REPRESENT\nA NOVEL, & PREVIOUSLY\nUNDERAPPRECIATED\nMECHANISM OF CELL\u2013CELL\nCOMMUNICATION\nIn the last decade, a class of small, heterogeneous, secreted\nvesi\ncles, broadly termed extracellular vesicles , have been\nidentified and characterized.

These vesicles,\nenclosed by a lipid bilayer, are somewhat heterogeneous in\nsize (30-2000 nm diameter), and are generated by at least two\ndistinct mechanisms ( Figure 40\u201323 ):microvesicles are gen-\nerated by budding from the plasma membrane of a source\ncell, while exosomes are generated from the multivesicu-\nlar body (MVB ), a component of the endocytic membrane\ntrafficking system described earlier (see Figures 40\u201320 and\n40\u201321). Exosomes are secreted from the source cell on fusion\nof the MVB with the plasma membrane. In both cases, the\nreleased extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles)\nultimately fuse to their target cell to deliver a distinct \u201cpay-\nload. \u201d Unfortunately, given the recent discovery of extracel-\nlular vesicles, the exact names and terms used to describe\nthese vesicles, their cargos, and relevant source and target\ncells vary in the biomedical literature.

Given the rich and broad diversity ofvesicle/exosome contents, it is not surprising that these struc-\ntures have been implicated in a very broad range of biology\nand diseases.

While some mutations directly\naffect the function of membrane proteins, the majority cause\nprotein misfolding that impair membrane trafficking at any of\na number of steps from their site of synthesis in the ER to the\nplasma membrane or other intracellular sites/organelles (see\nChapter 49).

This\nbilay\ner is formed by two sheets of phospholipids in which the\nhydrophilic polar head groups are directed away from each\nother and are exposed to the aqueous environment on the\nouter and inner surfaces of the membrane. The hydrophobic\nnonpolar tails of these molecules are oriented toward each\nother, in the direction of the center of the membrane.\n\u25a0Membranes are very dynamic structures. Lipids and certain\npro\nteins show rapid lateral diffusion. Flip-flop is very slow for\nlipids and almost nonexistent for proteins.\n\u25a0The fluid mosaic model forms a useful basis for thinking about\nmembr\nane structure and function.\n\u25a0Membrane proteins are classified as integral if they are firmly\nembedded in \nthe bilayer and as peripheral if they are attached\nto the outer or inner membrane surface.\n\u25a0The 20 or so membranes in a mammalian cell have different\ncom\npositions and functions and they define essential\ncompartments, or specialized environments, within the cell\nthat have specific functions.\n\u25a0Certain hydrophobic molecules freely diffuse across\nmembr\nanes, but the movement of others is restricted because\nof their size and/or charge.\n\u25a0Various passive and active (usually ATP-dependent)\nmechanisms \nare employed to maintain gradients of many\ndifferent molecules across different membranes.\n\u25a0Certain solutes, for example, glucose, enter cells by facilitated\ndiffusion alon\ng a downhill gradient from high to low\nconcentration using specific carrier proteins (transporters).\n\u25a0The major ATP-driven pumps are classified as P (phosphorylated),\nF (ener\ngy factors), V (vacuolar), and ABC transporters.\n\u25a0Ligand- or voltage-gated ion channels are often employed to\nmove \ncharged molecules (Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.) across membranes\ndown the\nir electrochemical gradients.\n\u25a0Large molecules can enter or leave cells through mechanisms\nsuch \nas endocytosis or exocytosis. These processes often\nrequire binding of the molecule to a receptor, which affords\nspecificity to the process.\n\u25a0Extracellular vesicles, termed exosomes, also allow direct\nmovem\nent of macromolecules from cell to cell via small\nvesicles. Exosome payloads can include specific lipids, proteins\n(receptors, channels, signaling proteins), DNA, RNAs, and\nsmall bioactive molecules.\n\u25a0Mutations that affect the structure of membrane proteins may\ncause \ndiseases.TABLE 40\u20137 Some Diseases or Pathologic States Resulting\nFrom \nor Attributed to Abnormalities of Membranesa\nDisease Abnormality\nAchondroplasia\n(OMIM \n100800)Mutations in the gene encoding the\nfibroblast growth factor receptor 3\nFamilial\nhypercholesterolemia\n(OMIM 143890)Mutations in the gene encoding the LDL\nreceptor\nCystic fibrosis\n(OMIM 219700)Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR\nprotein, a Cl\u2013transporter\nCongenital \nlong\nQT syndrome\n(OMIM 192500)Mutations in genes encoding ion\nchannels in the heart\nWilson disease\n(OMIM 277900)Mutations in the gene encoding a\ncopper-dependent ATPase\nI-cell disease\n(OMIM 252500)Mutations in the gene encoding GlcNAc\nphosphotransferase, resulting in absence\nof the Man 6-P signal for lysosomal\nlocalization of certain hydrolases\nHereditary\nspherocytosis (OMIM\n182900)Mutations in the genes encoding spectrin\nor other structural proteins in the red cell\nmembrane\nMetastasis of cancer\ncellsAbnormalities in the oligosaccharide\nchains of membrane glycoproteins\nand glycolipids are thought to be of\nimportance\nParoxysmal nocturnal\nhemoglobinuria\n(OMIM 311770)Mutation resulting in deficient\nattachment of the GPI anchor (see\nChapter 46) to certain proteins of the red\ncell membrane\nAbbreviations: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein; GPI, glyco-\nsylphosphatidylinositol; LDL, low-density lipoprotein.\naThe disorders listed are discussed further in other chapters.

Anthony Weil, PhDC H A P T E R\nBIOMEDICAL IMPORTANCE\nThe surviva\ue041 of mu\ue041tice\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar organisms depends on their\nabi\ue041it\ny to adapt to a constant\ue041y changing environment. Inter-\nce\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar communication mechanisms are necessary require-\nments for this adaptation. The nervous system and the\nendocrine system provide this interce\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar, organism-wide\ncommunication. The nervous system was origina\ue041\ue041y viewed as\nproviding a fixed communication system, whereas the endo-\ncrine system supp\ue041ied hormones, which are mobi\ue041e messages.\nIn fact, there is a remarkab\ue041e convergence of these regu\ue041atory\nsystems. For examp\ue041e, neura\ue041 regu\ue041ation of the endocrine sys-\ntem is important in the production and secretion of somehormones; many neurotransmitters resemb\ue041e hormones in\ntheir synthesis, transport, and mechanism of action; and many\nhormones are synthesized in the nervous system. The word\n\u201chormone\u201d is derived from a Greek term that means to arouse\nto activity. As c\ue041assica\ue041\ue041y defined, a hormone is a substance that\nis synthesized in one organ and transported by the circu\ue041atory\nsystem to act on another tissue. However, this origina\ue041 descrip-\ntion is too restrictive because hormones can act on adjacent\nce\ue041\ue041s (paracrine action) and on the ce\ue041\ue041 in which they were syn-\nthesized (autocrine action) without entering the systemic cir-\ncu\ue041ation.

This biochemica\ue041 diversity is the topic\nof this chapter.\nTHE TARGET CELL CONCEPT\nThere are over 200 types of differentiated ce\ue041\ue041s in humans.\nOn\ue041y a \nfew produce hormones, but virtua\ue041\ue041y a\ue041\ue041 of the 75 tri\ue041-\n\ue041ion ce\ue041\ue041s in a human are targets of one or more of the 50+\nknown hormones. The concept of the target ce\ue041\ue041 is a usefu\ue041 way\nof \ue041ooking at hormone action. It was thought that hormones\naffected a sing\ue041e ce\ue041\ue041 type\u2014or on\ue041y a few kinds of ce\ue041\ue041s\u2014and\nthat a hormone e\ue041icited a unique biochemica\ue041 or physio\ue041ogic\naction. We now know that a given hormone can affect severa\ue041\ndifferent ce\ue041\ue041 types; that more than one hormone can affect a\ngiven ce\ue041\ue041 type; and that hormones can exert many different\neffects in one ce\ue041\ue041 or in different ce\ue041\ue041s. With the discovery of\nspecific ce\ue041\ue041 surface and intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar hormone receptors, the\ndefinition of a target has been expanded to inc\ue041ude any ce\ue041\ue041\nin which the hormone (\ue041igand) binds to its receptor, whether\nor not a biochemica\ue041 or physio\ue041ogic response has yet been\ndetermined.\nSevera\ue041 factors determine the response of a target ce\ue041\ue041\nto a hormone. These can be thought of in two genera\ue041 ways:\n(1) as factors that affect the concentration of the hormone at\nthe target ce\ue041\ue041 ( Table 41\u20131 ) and (2) as factors that affect the\nactua\ue041 response of the target ce\ue041\ue041 to the hormone ( Table 41\u20132 ).\nHORMONE RECEPTORS ARE OF\nCENTRAL \nIMPORTANCE\nReceptors Discriminate Precisely\nOne of the major cha\ue041\ue041enges faced in making the hor-\nmon\ne-based communication system work is i\ue041\ue041ustrated in\nFigure 41\u20131 . Hormones are present at very \ue041ow concentrations\nin the extrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar f\ue041uid, genera\ue041\ue041y in the femto- to nanomo-\n\ue041ar range (10\u221215-10\u22129mo\ue041 /L). This concentration is much \ue041ower\nthan that of the many structura\ue041\ue041y simi\ue041ar mo\ue041ecu\ue041es (stero\ue041s,\namino acids, peptides, and proteins) and other mo\ue041ecu\ue041es\nthat circu\ue041ate at concentrations in the micro- to mi\ue041\ue041imo\ue041ar\n(10\u22126-10\u22123mo\ue041 /L) range. Target ce\ue041\ue041s, therefore, mustdistinguish not on\ue041y between different hormones present in\nsma\ue041\ue041 amounts but a\ue041so between a given hormone and the\n106- to 109-fo\ue041d excess of other simi\ue041ar mo\ue041ecu\ue041es. This high\ndegr\nee of discrimination is provided by ce\ue041\ue041-associated recogni-\ntion mo\ue041ecu\ue041es ca\ue041\ue041ed receptors. Hormones initiate their bio\ue041ogic\neffects by binding to hormone-specific receptors, and since any\neffective contro\ue041 system a\ue041so must provide a means of stopping\na response, hormone-induced actions genera\ue041\ue041y, but not a\ue041ways,\nterminate when the effector dissociates from the receptor (see\nFigure 38\u20131; Type A response).\nA target ce\ue041\ue041 is defined by its abi\ue041ity to se\ue041ective\ue041y bind a\ngiven hormone to its cognate receptor. Severa\ue041 biochemica\ue041\nfeatures of this interaction are important in order for hor-\nmone-receptor interactions to be physio\ue041ogica\ue041\ue041y re\ue041evant:\n(1) binding shou\ue041d be specific, that is, disp\ue041aceab\ue041e by agonist\nor antagonist; (2) binding shou\ue041d be saturab\ue041e; and (3) binding\nshou\ue041d occur within the concentration range of the expected\nbio\ue041ogic response.\nBoth Recognition & Coupling Domains\nOccur \non Receptors\nA\ue041\ue041 receptors have at \ue041east two functiona\ue041 domains.

This coup\ue041ing, or signa\ue041 transduction,\noccurs in two genera\ue041 ways. Po\ue041ypeptide and protein hor-\nmones and the catecho\ue041amines bind to receptors \ue041ocated in the\np\ue041asma membrane and thereby generate a signa\ue041 that regu\ue041ates\nvarious intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar functions, often by changing the activity of\nan enzyme. By contrast, the \ue041ipophi\ue041ic steroid, retinoid, and\nthyroid hormones interact with intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar receptors, and it\nis this \ue041igand-receptor comp\ue041ex within the nuc\ue041eus that direct\ue041y\nprovides the signa\ue041, genera\ue041\ue041y to specific genes whose rate of\ntranscription is thereby affected.\nThe domains responsib\ue041e for hormone recognition and\nsigna\ue041 generation have been identified in the protein po\ue041y-\npeptide and catecho\ue041amine hormone receptors. Like many\nother DNA-binding transcription factors, the steroid, thy-\nroid, and retinoid hormone receptors have severa\ue041 func-\ntiona\ue041 domains: one site binds the hormone; another binds\nto specific DNA regions; a third is invo\ue041ved in the interaction\nwith various coregu\ue041ator proteins that resu\ue041t in the activa-\ntion (or repression) of gene transcription; and a fourth\nregion may specify binding to one or more other proteins\nthat inf\ue041uence the intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar trafficking of the receptor\n(see Figure 38\u201319).\nThe dua\ue041 functions of binding and coup\ue041ing u\ue041timate\ue041y\ndefine a receptor, and it is the coup\ue041ing of hormone bind-\ning to signa\ue041 transduction, the so-ca\ue041\ue041ed receptor-effector\ncoupling \u2014that provides the first step in amp\ue041ification of the\nhormona\ue041 response. This dua\ue041 purpose a\ue041so distinguishes the\ntarget ce\ue041\ue041 receptor from the p\ue041asma carrier proteins that bind\nhormone but do not generate a signa\ue041 (see Tab\ue041e 41\u20136).\nReceptors Are Proteins\nSevera\ue041 c\ue041asses of peptide hormone receptors have been\ndefined. \nFor examp\ue041e, the insu\ue041in receptor is a heterotetra-\nmer composed of two copies of two different protein subunits\n(\u03b12\u03b22) \ue041inked by mu\ue041tip\ue041e disu\ue041fide bonds in which the extra-\nce\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar \n\u03b1 subunit binds insu\ue041in and the membrane-spanning \u03b2\nsubunit transduces the signa\ue041 through the tyrosine protein kinase\ndomain \ue041ocated in the cytop\ue041asmic portion of this po\ue041ypeptide.\nThe receptors for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and\nepidermal growth factor (EGF) are genera\ue041\ue041y simi\ue041ar in struc-\nture to the insu\ue041in receptor. The growth hormone (GH) and\nprolactin (PRL) receptors a\ue041so span the p\ue041asma membrane\nof target ce\ue041\ue041s but do not contain intrinsic protein kinase\nactivity. Ligand binding to these receptors, however, resu\ue041ts\nin the association and activation of a comp\ue041ete\ue041y different pro-\ntein kinase signa\ue041ing pathway, the Jak-Stat pathway. Po\ue041ypep-\ntide hormone and catecho\ue041amine receptors, which transduce\nsigna\ue041s by a\ue041tering the rate of production of cAMP through\nG-proteins , which are guanosine nuc\ue041eotide-binding proteins\nthat are characterized by the presence of seven membrane-\nspanning domains. Protein kinase activation and the genera-\ntion of cyc\ue041ic AMP (cAMP , 3 \u20325\u2032-adeny\ue041ic acid; see Figure 18\u20135)\nis a downstream action of this c\ue041ass of receptor (see Chapter 42\nfor further detai\ue041s).A comparison of severa\ue041 different steroid receptors with\nthyroid hormone receptors revea\ue041ed a remarkab\ue041e conserva-\ntion of the amino acid sequence in certain regions, particu\ue041ar\ue041y\nin the DNA-binding domains. This observation \ue041ed to the rea\ue041-\nization that receptors of the steroid and thyroid type are mem-\nbers of a \ue041arge superfami\ue041y of nuc\ue041ear receptors. Many re\ue041ated\nmembers of this fami\ue041y current\ue041y have no known \ue041igand and\nthus are ca\ue041\ue041ed orphan receptors. The nuc\ue041ear receptor super-\nfami\ue041y p\ue041ays a critica\ue041 ro\ue041e in the regu\ue041ation of gene transcrip-\ntion by hormones, as described in Chapter 42.\nHORMONES CAN BE CLASSIFIED\nIN \nSEVERAL WAYS\nHormones can be c\ue041assified according to chemica\ue041 composi-\ntion, \nso\ue041ubi\ue041ity properties, \ue041ocation of receptors, and the nature\nof the signa\ue041 used to mediate hormona\ue041 action within the ce\ue041\ue041.\nA c\ue041assification based on the \ue041ast two properties is i\ue041\ue041ustrated\ninTable 41\u20133 , and genera\ue041 features of each group are i\ue041\ue041us-\ntrated in Table 41\u20134 .\nThe hormones in group I are \ue041ipophi\ue041ic. After secretion,\nthese hormones associate with p\ue041asma transport or carrier\nproteins, a process that circumvents the prob\ue041em of so\ue041ubi\ue041ity\nwhi\ue041e pro\ue041onging the p\ue041asma ha\ue041f-\ue041ife of the hormone. The re\ue041-\native percentages of bound and free hormone are determined\nby the amount, binding affinity, and binding capacity of the\ntransport protein. The free hormone, which is the bio\ue041ogica\ue041\ue041y\nactive form, readi\ue041y traverses the \ue041ipophi\ue041ic p\ue041asma membrane\nof a\ue041\ue041 ce\ue041\ue041s and encounters receptors in either the cytoso\ue041 or\nnuc\ue041eus of target ce\ue041\ue041s. The \ue041igand-receptor comp\ue041ex is the\nintrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar messenger in this group.\nThe second major group consists of water-so\ue041ub\ue041e hor-\nmones that bind to specific receptors spanning the p\ue041asma\nmembrane of the target ce\ue041\ue041. Hormones that bind to these\nsurface receptors of ce\ue041\ue041s communicate with intrace\ue041\ue041u-\n\ue041ar metabo\ue041ic processes through intermediary mo\ue041ecu\ue041es\nca\ue041\ue041ed second messengers (the hormone itse\ue041f is the first\nmessenger), which are generated as a consequence of the\n\ue041igand-receptor interaction. The second messenger concept\narose from an observation that epinephrine binds to the\np\ue041asma membrane of certain ce\ue041\ue041s and increases intrace\ue041-\n\ue041u\ue041ar cAMP. This was fo\ue041\ue041owed by a series of experiments in\nwhich cAMP was found to mediate the effects of many hor-\nmones. Hormones that emp\ue041oy this mechanism are shown\nin group II.A of Tab\ue041e 41\u20133. Atria\ue041 natriuretic factor (ANF)\nuses cGMP as its second messenger (group II.B). Severa\ue041\nhormones, many of which were previous\ue041y thought to affect\ncAMP, appear to use ionic ca\ue041cium (Ca2+) or metabo\ue041ites\nof c\nomp\ue041ex phosphoinositides (or both) as the intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar\nsecond messenger signa\ue041, and are shown in group II.C of the\ntab\ue041e. The intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar messenger for group II.D is a pro-\ntein kinase\u2013phosphatase cascade; severa\ue041 have been identi-\nfied, and a given hormone may use more than one kinase\ncascade. A few hormones fit into more than one category,\nand assignments change as new information is discovered."

Much of the cho\ue041estero\ue041 in the adrena\ue041 is esteri-\nfied and stored in cytop\ue041asmic \ue041ipid drop\ue041ets. Upon stimu\ue041a-\ntion of the adrena\ue041 by ACTH, an esterase is activated, and\nthe free cho\ue041estero\ue041 formed is transported into the mitochon-\ndrion, where a cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme\n(P450scc) converts cho\ue041estero\ue041 to pregneno\ue041one. C\ue041eavage of\nthe side chain invo\ue041ves sequentia\ue041 hydroxy\ue041ations, first at C22\nand \nthen at C20, fo\ue041\ue041owed by side chain c\ue041eavage (remova\ue041\nof \nthe six-carbon fragment isocaproa\ue041dehyde) to give the\n21-carbon steroid ( Figure 41\u20133 , top). An ACTH-dependent\nsteroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein is essentia\ue041 for\nthe transport of cho\ue041estero\ue041 to P450scc in the inner mitochon-\ndria\ue041 membrane.\nA\ue041\ue041 mamma\ue041ian steroid hormones are formed from cho\ue041es-\ntero\ue041 via pregneno\ue041one through a series of reactions that occur\nin either the mitochondria or endop\ue041asmic reticu\ue041um of the\nproducing ce\ue041\ue041. Hydroxy\ue041ases that require mo\ue041ecu\ue041ar oxygen\nand NADPH are essentia\ue041, and dehydrogenases, an isomerase,\nand a \ue041yase reaction are a\ue041so necessary for certain steps. There\nis ce\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar specificity in adrena\ue041 steroidogenesis. For instance,18-hydroxy\ue041ase and 19-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, which\nare required for a\ue041dosterone synthesis, are found on\ue041y in the\nzona g\ue041omeru\ue041osa ce\ue041\ue041s (the outer region of the adrena\ue041 cortex),\nso that the biosynthesis of this minera\ue041ocorticoid is confined\nto this region. A schematic representation of the pathways\ninvo\ue041ved in the synthesis of the three major c\ue041asses of adrena\ue041\nsteroids is presented in Figure 41\u20134 . The enzymes are shown\nin the rectangu\ue041ar boxes, and the modifications at each step\nare shaded.\nMineralocorticoid Synthesis\nSynthesis of aldosterone follows the mineralocorticoid path way\nand occurs in the zona g\ue041omeru\ue041osa. Pregneno\ue041one is con-\nverted to progesterone by the action of two smooth endop\ue041as-\nmic reticu\ue041um enzymes, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\n(3\u03b2-OHSD) and\u03945,4-isomerase . Progesterone is hydroxy\ue041ated\nat the C21position to form 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC),\nwhich is an active (Na+-retaining) minera\ue041ocorticoid. The\nnext \nhydroxy\ue041ation, at C11, produces corticosterone, which\nhas \ng\ue041ucocorticoid activity and is a weak minera\ue041ocorticoid\n(it has <5% of the potency of a\ue041dosterone). In some species\n(eg, rodents), it is the most potent g\ue041ucocorticoid. C21hy drox-\ny\ue041ation is necessary for both minera\ue041ocorticoid and g\ue041ucocorti-\ncoid activity, but most steroids with a C17hy droxy\ue041 group have\nmore g\ue041ucocorticoid and \ue041ess minera\ue041ocorticoid action. In the\nzona g\ue041omeru\ue041osa, which does not have the smooth endo-\np\ue041asmic reticu\ue041um enzyme 17\u03b1-hydroxy\ue041ase, a mitochondria\ue041\n18-hydroxy\ue041ase is present.

Steroidogenesis thus invo\ue041ves the repeated shut-\nt\ue041ing of substrates into and out of the mitochondria.\nAndrogen Synthesis\nThe major androgen or androgen precursor produced by the\nadrena\ue041 \ncortex is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Most\n17-hydroxypregneno\ue041one fo\ue041\ue041ows the g\ue041ucocorticoid path-\nway, but a sma\ue041\ue041 fraction is subjected to oxidative fission and\nremova\ue041 of the two-carbon side chain through the action of\n17,20-\ue041yase. The \ue041yase activity is actua\ue041\ue041y part of the same\nenzyme (P450c17) that cata\ue041yzes 17\u03b1-hydroxy\ue041ation. This is\ntherefore a dual-function protein . The \ue041yase activity is impor-\ntant in both the adrena\ue041s and the gonads and acts exc\ue041usive\ue041y\non 17\u03b1-hydroxy-containing mo\ue041ecu\ue041es. Adrena\ue041 androgen pro-\nduction increases marked\ue041y if g\ue041ucocorticoid biosynthesis is\nimpeded by the \ue041ack of one of the hydroxy\ue041ases (adrenogenital\nsyndrome) . DHEA is rea\ue041\ue041y a prohormone since the actions\nof 3\u03b2-OHSD and \u03945,4-isomerase convert the weak androgen\nDHEA \ninto the more potent androstenedione . Sma\ue041\ue041 amounts\nof androstenedione are a\ue041so formed in the adrena\ue041 by the\naction of the \ue041yase on 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone. Reduction\nof androstenedione at the C17position resu\ue041ts in the forma-\ntion of testosterone , the most potent adrena\ue041 androgen. Sma\ue041\ue041\namounts of testosterone are produced in the adrena\ue041 by this\nmechanism, but most of this conversion occurs in the testes.\nTesticular Steroidogenesis\nTesticu\ue041ar androgens are synthesized in the interstitia\ue041 tissue\nby \nthe Leydig ce\ue041\ue041s. The immediate precursor of the gonada\ue041\nsteroids, as for the adrena\ue041 steroids, is cho\ue041estero\ue041. The rate-\n\ue041imiting step, as in the adrena\ue041, is de\ue041ivery of cho\ue041estero\ue041 to the\ninner membrane of the mitochondria by the transport protein\nStAR. Once in the proper \ue041ocation, cho\ue041estero\ue041 is acted upon\nby the side chain c\ue041eavage enzyme P450scc. The conversion\nof cho\ue041estero\ue041 to pregneno\ue041one is identica\ue041 in adrena\ue041, ovary,\nand testis. In the \ue041atter two tissues, however, the reaction is\npromoted by LH rather than ACTH.\nThe conversion of pregneno\ue041one to testosterone requires\nthe action of five enzyme activities contained in three pro-\nteins: (1) 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-OHSD) and\n\u03945,4-isomerase; (2) 17\u03b1-hydroxy\ue041ase and 17,20-\ue041yase; and\n(3) \n17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-OHSD). This\nsequence, referred to as the progesterone (or \u03944) pathway,\nis shown on the\n right side of Figure 41\u20135 . Pregneno\ue041one can\na\ue041so be converted to testosterone by the dehydroepiandros-\nterone (or \u03945)pathway , which is i\ue041\ue041ustrated on the \ue041eft side of\nFigure 41\u20135. The \u0394 5route appears to be most used in human\ntestes.\nThe five enzyme activities are \ue041oca\ue041ized in the microsoma\ue041\nfraction in rat testes, and there is a c\ue041ose functiona\ue041 association\nbetween the activities of 3\u03b2-OHSD and \u03945,4-isomerase and\nbetween \nthose of a 17\u03b1-hydroxy\ue041ase and 17,20-\ue041yase. These\nenzyme pairs, both contained in a sing\ue041e protein, are shown in\nthe genera\ue041 reaction sequence in Figure 41\u20135.DHT Is Formed From Testosterone in\nPeripher\nal Tissues\nTestosterone is metabo\ue041ized by two pathways. One invo\ue041ves\noxida\ntion at the 17-position, and the other invo\ue041ves reduction\nof the A ring doub\ue041e bond and the 3-ketone. Metabo\ue041ism by\nthe first pathway occurs in many tissues, inc\ue041uding \ue041iver, and\nproduces 17-ketosteroids that are genera\ue041\ue041y inactive or \ue041ess\nactive than the parent compound. Metabo\ue041ism by the second\npathway, which is \ue041ess efficient, occurs primari\ue041y in target tis-\nsues and produces the potent metabo\ue041ite DHT.\nThe most significant metabo\ue041ic product of testosterone is\nDHT, since in many tissues, inc\ue041uding prostate, externa\ue041 geni-\nta\ue041ia, and some areas of the skin, this is the active form of the\nhormone. The p\ue041asma content of DHT in the adu\ue041t ma\ue041e is\nabout one-tenth that of testosterone, and ~400 \u03bcg of DHT is\nproduced dai\ue041y as compared with about 5 mg of testosterone.\nAbout 50 to 100 \u03bcg of DHT are secreted by the testes. The rest\nis produced periphera\ue041\ue041y from testosterone in a reaction cata-\n\ue041yzed by the NADPH-dependent 5\u03b1-reductase (Figure 41\u20136 ).\nTestosterone can thus be considered a prohormone since it is\nconverted into a much more potent compound (DHT) and\nsince most of this conversion occurs outside the testes. Some\nestradio\ue041 is formed from the periphera\ue041 aromatization of tes-\ntosterone, particu\ue041ar\ue041y in ma\ue041es.\nOvarian Steroidogenesis\nThe estrogens are a fami\ue041y of hormones synthesized in a vari-\nety o\nf tissues. 17\u03b2-Estradio\ue041 is the primary estrogen of ovarian\norigin. In some species, estrone, synthesized in numerous tis-\nsues, is more abundant. In pregnancy, re\ue041ative\ue041y more estrio\ue041\nis produced, and this comes from the p\ue041acenta. The genera\ue041\npathway and the subce\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar \ue041oca\ue041ization of the enzymes\ninvo\ue041ved in the ear\ue041y steps of estradio\ue041 synthesis are the same\nas those invo\ue041ved in androgen biosynthesis. Features unique to\nthe ovary are i\ue041\ue041ustrated in Figure 41\u20137 .\nEstrogens are formed by the aromatization of andro-\ngens in a comp\ue041ex process that invo\ue041ves three hydroxy\ue041ation\nsteps, each of which requires O2and NADPH.

Tyrosine hydroxy\ue041ase is found in both\nso\ue041ub\ue041e and partic\ue041e-bound forms on\ue041y in tissues that syn-\nthesize catecho\ue041amines; it functions as an oxidoreductase,\nwith tetrahydropteridine as a cofactor, to convert l-tyrosine\nto l-dihydroxypheny\ue041a\ue041anine (l -dopa ).

These hormones\nrequire a rare e\ue041ement (iodine) for bioactivity; they are synthe-\nsized as part of a very \ue041arge precursor mo\ue041ecu\ue041e (thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in);\nthey are stored in an intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar reservoir (co\ue041\ue041oid); and there\nis periphera\ue041 conversion of T4to T3, which is a much more\nactive ho\nrmone.\nThe thyroid hormones T3and T4are unique in that\niodine (as iodide) is an essentia\ue041 component of both. In most\nparts of the wor\ue041d, iodine is a scarce component of soi\ue041, and\nfor that reason there is \ue041itt\ue041e in food. A comp\ue041ex mechanism\nhas evo\ue041ved to acquire and retain this crucia\ue041 e\ue041ement and to\nconvert it into a form suitab\ue041e for incorporation into organic\ncompounds. At the same time, the thyroid must synthesize\nthyronine from tyrosine, and this synthesis takes p\ue041ace in thy-\nrog\ue041obu\ue041in ( Figure 41\u201311 ).\nThyroglobulin is the precursor of T4and T3. It is a \ue041arge\nio\ndinated, g\ue041ycosy\ue041ated protein with a mo\ue041ecu\ue041ar mass of\n660 kDa. Carbohydrate accounts for 8 to 10% of the weight\nof thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in and iodide for about 0.2 to 1%, depending on\nthe iodine content in the diet. Thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in is composed of\ntwo \ue041arge subunits. It contains 115 tyrosine residues, each of\nwhich is a potentia\ue041 site of iodination. About 70% of the iodide\nin thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in exists in the inactive precursors, monoiodo-\ntyrosine (MIT) anddiiodotyrosine (DIT) , whi\ue041e 30% is in\ntheiodothyronyl residues , T4and T3. When iodine supp\ue041ies\nare \nsufficient, the T4:T3ratio is about 7:1. In iodine deficiency ,\nthis ratio decreases, as does the DIT:MIT ratio. Thyrog\ue041obu-\n\ue041in, a \ue041arge mo\ue041ecu\ue041e of about 5000 amino acids, provides the\nconformation required for tyrosy\ue041 coup\ue041ing and iodide organi-\nfication necessary in the formation of the diaminoacid thyroid\nhormones. It is synthesized in the basa\ue041 portion of the ce\ue041\ue041 and\nmoves to the \ue041umen, where it is a storage form of T3and T4in\nth\ne co\ue041\ue041oid; severa\ue041 weeks\u2019 supp\ue041y of these hormones exist\nin the norma\ue041 thyroid. Within minutes after stimu\ue041ation of the\nthyroid by TSH, co\ue041\ue041oid reenters the ce\ue041\ue041 and there is a marked\nincrease of phago\ue041ysosome activity. Various acid proteases andpeptidases hydro\ue041yze the thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in into its constituent\namino acids, inc\ue041uding T4and T3, which are discharged into\nthe \nextrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar space (see Figure 41\u201311). Thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in is\nthus a very \ue041arge prohormone.\nIodide Metabolism Involves Several\nDiscrete \nSteps\nThe thyroid is ab\ue041e to concentrate I\u2212against a strong e\ue041ec-\ntrochemica\ue041 gradient. This is an energy-dependent process\nand is \ue041inked to the Na+-K+-ATPase\u2013dependent thyroida\ue041 I\u2212\ntransporter\n. The ratio of iodide in thyroid to iodide in serum\n(T:S ratio) is a ref\ue041ection of the activity of this transporter.\nThis activity is primari\ue041y contro\ue041\ue041ed by TSH and ranges from\n500:1 in anima\ue041s chronica\ue041\ue041y stimu\ue041ated with TSH to 5:1 or\n\ue041ess in hypophysectomized anima\ue041s (no TSH). The T:S ratio in\nhumans on a norma\ue041 iodine diet is about 25:1.\nThe thyroid is the on\ue041y tissue that can oxidize I\u2212to a higher\nva\ue041ence state, an ob\ue041igatory step in I\u2212organifica tion and thyroid\nhormone biosynthesis. This step invo\ue041ves a heme-containing\nperoxidase and occurs at the \ue041umina\ue041 surface of the fo\ue041\ue041icu\ue041ar\nce\ue041\ue041. Thyroperoxidase, a tetrameric protein with a mo\ue041ecu\ue041ar\nmass of 60 kDa, requires hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxi-\ndizing \nagent. The H2O2is produced by an NADPH-dependent\nenzyme resemb\ue041ing cytochrome creductase. A number of\ncompounds inhibit I\u2212oxida tion and therefore its subsequent\nincorporation into MIT and DIT. The most important of these\nare the thiourea drugs. They are used as antithyroid drugs\nbecause of their abi\ue041ity to inhibit thyroid hormone biosynthe-\nsis at this step. Once iodination occurs, the iodine does not\nreadi\ue041y \ue041eave the thyroid. Free tyrosine can be iodinated, but\nit is not incorporated into proteins since no tRNA recognizes\niodinated tyrosine.\nThe coup\ue041ing of two DIT mo\ue041ecu\ue041es to form T4\u2014or of an\nMIT \nand DIT to form T3\u2014occurs within the thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in\nmo\ue041ecu\ue041e. \nA separate coup\ue041ing enzyme has not been found,\nand since this is an oxidative process, it is assumed that the\nsame thyroperoxidase cata\ue041yzes this reaction by stimu\ue041ating\nfree radica\ue041 formation of iodotyrosine. This hypothesis is sup-\nported by the observation that the same drugs which inhibit\nI\u2212oxida tion a\ue041so inhibit coup\ue041ing. The formed thyroid hor-\nmones remain as integra\ue041 parts of thyrog\ue041obu\ue041in unti\ue041 the \ue041atter\nis degraded, as described ear\ue041ier.\nA deiodinase removes I\u2212from the inactive mono and\ndiiodothyronine mo\ue041ecu\ue041es in the thyroid. This mechanism\nprovides a substantia\ue041 amount of the I\u2212used in T3and T4bio-\nsynthesis. \nA periphera\ue041 deiodinase in target tissues such as\npituitary, kidney, and \ue041iver se\ue041ective\ue041y removes I\u2212from the 5 \u2032\nposition of T4to make T3(see Figure 41\u20132), which is a much\nmore active mo\ue041ecu\ue041e. In this sense, T4can be t hought of as a\nprohormone, though it does have some intrinsic activity.\nSeveral Hormones Are Made From\nLarger \nPeptide Precursors\nFormation of the critica\ue041 disu\ue041fide bridges in insu\ue041in requires\nthat \nthis hormone be first synthesized as part of a \ue041arger"

However, about\n80 to 90% of the proPTH synthesized cannot be accounted for\nas intact PTH in ce\ue041\ue041s or in the incubation medium of experi-\nmenta\ue041 systems. This finding \ue041ed to the conc\ue041usion that most\nof the proPTH synthesized is quick\ue041y degraded. It was \ue041ater\ndiscovered that this rate of degradation decreases when Ca2+\nconc\nentrations are \ue041ow, and it increases when Ca2+conc entra-\ntions are high. A Ca2+recep tor on the surface of the parathyroid\nce\ue041\ue041 mediates these effects.

The primary hormone invo\ue041ved in these pro-\ncesses is angiotensin II, an octapeptide made from angioten-\nsinogen ( Figure 41\u201314 ). Angiotensinogen, a \ue041arge \u03b12-g\ue041obu\ue041in\nmad\ne in \ue041iver, is the substrate for renin, an enzyme produced\nin the juxtag\ue041omeru\ue041ar ce\ue041\ue041s of the rena\ue041 afferent arterio\ue041e. The\nposition of these ce\ue041\ue041s makes them particu\ue041ar\ue041y sensitive to\nb\ue041ood pressure changes, and many of the physio\ue041ogic regu\ue041ators\nof renin re\ue041ease act through rena\ue041 baroreceptors. The juxtag\ue041o-\nmeru\ue041ar ce\ue041\ue041s are a\ue041so sensitive to changes of Na+an d C\ue041\u2212co n-\ncentration in the rena\ue041 tubu\ue041ar f\ue041uid; therefore, any combination\nof factors that decreases f\ue041uid vo\ue041ume (dehydration, decreased\nb\ue041ood pressure, f\ue041uid, or b\ue041ood \ue041oss) or decreases NaC\ue041 concen-\ntration stimu\ue041ates renin re\ue041ease.

Renin acts on the substrate angio-\ntensinogen to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) , a g\ue041ycoprotein\nfound in \ue041ung, endothe\ue041ia\ue041 ce\ue041\ue041s, and p\ue041asma, removes two\ncarboxy\ue041 termina\ue041 amino acids from the decapeptide angio-\ntensin I to form angiotensin II in a step that is not thought to\nbe rate-\ue041imiting. Various nonapeptide ana\ue041ogs of angiotensin Iand other compounds act as competitive inhibitors of convert-\ning enzyme and are used to treat renin-dependent hyperten-\nsion. These are referred to as ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II\nincreases b\ue041ood pressure by causing vasoconstriction of the\narterio\ue041e and is a very potent vasoactive substance. It inhibits\nrenin re\ue041ease from the juxtag\ue041omeru\ue041ar ce\ue041\ue041s and is a potent\nstimu\ue041ator of a\ue041dosterone production. This resu\ue041ts in Na+\nreten\ntion, vo\ue041ume expansion, and increased b\ue041ood pressure.\nIn some species, angiotensin II is converted to the hepta-\npeptide angiotensin III (see Figure 41\u201314), an equa\ue041\ue041y potent stim-\nu\ue041ator of a\ue041dosterone production. In humans, the p\ue041asma \ue041eve\ue041 of\nangiotensin II is four times greater than that of angiotensin III,\nso most effects are exerted by the octapeptide.

They are a\ue041so secreted\nas they are made, and thus there is no intrace\ue041\ue041u\ue041ar reservoirof these hormones. The catecho\ue041amines, a\ue041so synthesized in\nactive form, are stored in granu\ue041es in the chromaffin ce\ue041\ue041s in the\nadrena\ue041 medu\ue041\ue041a. In response to appropriate neura\ue041 stimu\ue041a-\ntion, these granu\ue041es are re\ue041eased from the ce\ue041\ue041 through exocy-\ntosis, and the catecho\ue041amines are re\ue041eased into the circu\ue041ation.\nA severa\ue041-hour reserve supp\ue041y of catecho\ue041amines exists in the\nchromaffin ce\ue041\ue041s.\nPTH a\ue041so exists in storage vesic\ue041es. As much as 80 to 90%\nof the proPTH synthesized is degraded before it enters this\nfina\ue041 storage compartment, especia\ue041\ue041y when Ca2+\ue041eve\ue041s are\nhigh in the parathyroid ce\ue041\ue041 (see ear\ue041ier). PTH is secreted when\nCa2+is \ue041ow in the parathyroid ce\ue041\ue041s, which contain a severa\ue041-\nhour supp\ue041y of the hormone.\nThe human pancreas secretes about 40 to 50 units of insu\ue041in\ndai\ue041y; this represents about 15 to 20% of the hormone stored\nin the \u03b2 ce\ue041\ue041s. Insu\ue041in and the C-peptide (see Figure 41\u201312) are\nnorma\ue041\ue041y secreted in equimo\ue041ar amounts. Stimu\ue041i such as g\ue041u-\ncose, which provokes insu\ue041in secretion, therefore trigger the\nprocessing of proinsu\ue041in to insu\ue041in as an essentia\ue041 part of the\nsecretory response.\nA severa\ue041-week supp\ue041y of T3and T4exists in the thyro-\ng\ue041obu\ue041in that is stored in co\ue041\ue041oid in the \ue041umen of the thyroid\nfo\ue041\ue041ic\ue041es.

These hormones, prin-\ncipa\ue041\ue041y the steroids and thyroid hormones, have specia\ue041ized\np\ue041asma transport proteins that serve severa\ue041 purposes. First,\nthese proteins circumvent the so\ue041ubi\ue041ity prob\ue041em and thereby\nde\ue041iver the hormone to the target ce\ue041\ue041. They a\ue041so provide a cir-\ncu\ue041ating reservoir of the hormone that can be substantia\ue041, as\nin the case of the thyroid hormones. Hormones, when bound\nto the transport proteins, cannot be metabo\ue041ized, thereby\npro\ue041onging their p\ue041asma ha\ue041f-\ue041ife ( t\u00bd). The binding affinity\nof \na given hormone to its transporter determines the bound\nversus free ratio of the hormone. This is important because\non\ue041y the free form of a hormone is bio\ue041ogica\ue041\ue041y active. In gen-\nera\ue041, the concentration of free hormone in p\ue041asma is very \ue041ow,\nin the range of 10\u221215to 10\u22129mo\ue041/L. It is important to distinguish\nbetween p\ue041asma transport proteins and hormone receptors.\nBoth bind hormones but with very different characteristics\n(Table 41\u20136) .\nThe hydrophi\ue041ic hormones\u2014genera\ue041\ue041y c\ue041ass II and of\npeptide structure\u2014are free\ue041y so\ue041ub\ue041e in p\ue041asma and do not\nrequire transport proteins. Hormones such as insu\ue041in, growth\nhormone, ACTH, and TSH circu\ue041ate in the free, active form\nand have very short p\ue041asma ha\ue041f-\ue041ives. A notab\ue041e exception isIGF-I, which is transported bound to members of a fami\ue041y of\nbinding proteins.\nThyroid Hormones Are Transported by\nTh\nyroid-Binding Globulin\nMany of the princip\ue041es discussed above are i\ue041\ue041ustrated in a dis-\ncussion \nof thyroid-binding proteins. One-ha\ue041f to two-thirds of\nT4and T3in the body is in an extrathyroida\ue041 reservoir. Most\nof this circu\ue041ates in bound form, that is, bound to a specific\nbinding protein, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) . TBG, a\ng\ue041ycoprotein with a mo\ue041ecu\ue041ar mass of 50 kDa, binds T4and T3\nand has \nthe capacity to bind 20 \u03bcg/dL of p\ue041asma. Under nor-\nma\ue041 circumstances, TBG binds\u2014noncova\ue041ent\ue041y\u2014near\ue041y a\ue041\ue041 of\nthe T4and T3in p\ue041asma, and it binds T4with greater affinity\nthan T3(T able 41\u20137 ). The p\ue041asma ha\ue041f-\ue041ife of T4is correspond-\ning\ue041y four to five times that of T3. The sma\ue041\ue041, unbound (free)\nfraction \nis responsib\ue041e for the bio\ue041ogic activity. Thus, in spite\nof the great difference in tota\ue041 amount, the free fraction of T3\napp\nroximates that of T4, and given that T3is intrinsica\ue041\ue041y more\nactive than T4, most bio\ue041ogic activity is attributed to T3. TBG\ndoes not \nbind any other hormones.\nGlucocorticoids Are Transported by\nCorticosteroid-Binding \nGlobulin\nHydrocortisone (cortiso\ue041) a\ue041so circu\ue041ates in p\ue041asma in protein-\nbound \nand free forms. The main p\ue041asma binding protein is\nan \u03b1-g\ue041obu\ue041in ca\ue041\ue041ed transcortin , orcorticosteroid-binding\nglobulin (CBG) . CBG is produced in the \ue041iver, and its syn-\nthesis, \ue041ike that of TBG, is increased by estrogens. CBG binds\nmost of the hormone when p\ue041asma cortiso\ue041 \ue041eve\ue041s are within\nthe norma\ue041 range; much sma\ue041\ue041er amounts of cortiso\ue041 are\nbound to a\ue041bumin. The affinity of binding he\ue041ps determine the\nbio\ue041ogic ha\ue041f-\ue041ives of various g\ue041ucocorticoids. Cortiso\ue041 binds\ntight\ue041y to CBG and has a t\u00bdof 1.5 to 2 hours, whi\ue041e corticos-\nterone, which binds \ue041ess tight\ue041y, has a t\u00bdof \ue041ess than 1 hour\n(Table 41\u20138 ). The unbound (free) cortiso\ue041 constitutes ~8%\nof the tota\ue041 and represents the bio\ue041ogica\ue041\ue041y active fraction.\nBinding to CBG is not restricted to g\ue041ucocorticoids. Deoxy-\ncorticosterone and progesterone interact with CBG with suf-\nficient affinity to compete for cortiso\ue041 binding. A\ue041dosterone,\nthe most potent natura\ue041 minera\ue041ocorticoid, does not have a\nspecific p\ue041asma transport protein. Gonada\ue041 steroids bind very\nweak\ue041y to CBG (see Tab\ue041e 41\u20138).TABLE 41\u20135 Diversity in the Storage of Hormones\nHormone Supply Stored in Cell\nSteroids \nand 1,25(OH)2-D3None\nCatecholamines \nand PTH Hours\nInsulin Days\nT3and T4Weeks"

Its produc-\ntion is increased by estrogens (women have twice the serum\nconcentration of SHBG as men), certain types of \ue041iver disease,\nand hyperthyroidism; it is decreased by androgens, advancing\nage, and hypothyroidism. Many of these conditions a\ue041so affect\nthe production of CBG and TBG. Since SHBG and a\ue041bumin\nbind 97 to 99% of circu\ue041ating testosterone, on\ue041y a sma\ue041\ue041 fraction\nof the hormone in circu\ue041ation is in the free (bio\ue041ogica\ue041\ue041y active)\nform. The primary function of SHBG may be to restrict the free\nconcentration of testosterone in the serum. Testosterone binds to\nSHBG with higher affinity than does estradio\ue041 (see Tab\ue041e 41\u20138).\nTherefore, a change in the \ue041eve\ue041 of SHBG causes a greater change\nin the free testosterone \ue041eve\ue041 than in the free estradio\ue041 \ue041eve\ue041.\nEstrogens are bound to SHBG and progestins to CBG.\nSHBG binds estradio\ue041 about five times \ue041ess avid\ue041y than it binds\ntestosterone or DHT, whi\ue041e progesterone and cortiso\ue041 have\n\ue041itt\ue041e affinity for this protein (see Tab\ue041e 41\u20138). In contrast, pro-\ngesterone and cortiso\ue041 bind with near\ue041y equa\ue041 affinity to CBG,\nwhich in turn has \ue041itt\ue041e affinity for estradio\ue041 and even \ue041ess for\ntestosterone, DHT, or estrone.\nThese binding proteins a\ue041so provide a circu\ue041ating reservoir\nof hormone, and because of the re\ue041ative\ue041y \ue041arge binding capac-\nity, they probab\ue041y buffer against sudden changes in the p\ue041asma\n\ue041eve\ue041.

A hormone-receptor interaction results in genera-\ntion of an amplified intracellular signal that can either regu-\nlate the activity of a select set of genes that alters the amounts\nof certain proteins in the target cell or affect the activity of\nspecific proteins, including enzymes, transporters, or channel\nproteins. Signals can influence the location of proteins in the\ncell, and often affects general processes such as protein syn-\nthesis, cell growth, and replication, via their effects on gene\nexpression. Other signaling molecules\u2014including cytokines,\ninterleukins, growth factors, and metabolites\u2014use some of the\nsame general mechanisms and signal transduction pathways.\nExcessive, deficient, or inappropriate production and release\nof hormones and the other regulatory signaling molecules are\nmajor causes of disease. Many pharmacotherapeutic agents\nare aimed at correcting or otherwise influencing the pathways\ndiscussed in this chapter.HORMONES TRANSDUCE\nSIGNALS \nTO AFFECT\nHOMEOSTATIC MECHANISMS\nThe general steps involved in producing a coordinated\nrespon\nse to a particular stimulus are illustrated in Figure 42\u20131 .\nThe stimulus can be a challenge or a threat to the organism, to\nan organ, or to the integrity of a single cell within that organism.\nRecognition of the stimulus is the first step in the adaptive\nresponse. At the organismic level, this generally involves the\nnervous system and the special senses (sight, hearing, pain,\nsmell, and touch). At the organ, tissue, or cellular level, recog-\nnition involves physicochemical factors such as pH, O2te nsion,\ntemperature, nutrient supply, noxious metabolites, and osmo-\nlarity. Appropriate recognition of such stimuli results in the\nrelease of one or more hormones that will govern generation\nof the necessary adaptive response. For purposes of this discus-\nsion, the hormones are categorized as described in Table 41\u20134,\nthat is, based on the location of their specific cellular receptors\nand the type of signals generated.

The cytokines, interleukins,\nand growth factors should also be considered in this latter cat-\negory. These molecules, of critical importance in homeostatic\nadaptation, are hormones in the sense that they are produced\nin specific cells, have the equivalent of autocrine, paracrine, and\nendocrine actions, bind to cell surface receptors, and activate\nmany of the same signal transduction pathways employed by the\nmore traditional group II hormones.\nSIGNAL GENERATION\nThe Ligand-Receptor Complex Is the\nSignal \nfor Group I Hormones\nThe lipophilic group I hormones diffuse through the plasma\nme\nmbrane of all cells but only encounter their specific, high-\naffinity intracellular receptors in target cells. These receptors\ncan be located in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of target cells.\nThe hormone-receptor complex first undergoes an activation\nreaction . As shown in Figure 42\u20132 , receptor activation occurs\nby at least two mechanisms. For example, glucocorticoids dif-\nfuse across the plasma membrane and encounter their cognate\nreceptor in the cytoplasm of target cells. Ligand-receptor bind-\ning results in a conformational change in the receptor leading to\nthe dissociation of the heat shock protein 90 (hsp90 chaperone;\nChapters 5, 49). This step is necessary for subsequent nuclear\ntranslocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The GR recep-\ntor also contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that is\nnow free to facilitate translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus.\nThe activated receptor moves into the nucleus (Figure 42\u20132)\nand binds with high affinity to a specific DNA sequence called\nthehormone response element (HRE) .

The receptor-ligand com-\nplex then traverses the nuclear membrane and binds to DNA with\nspecificity and high affinity at a glucocorticoid response element\n(GRE). This event affects the architecture of a number of transcription\ncoregulators (green triangles), and enhanced transcription ensues.\nBy contrast, thyroid hormones and retinoic acid ( black circle ) directly\nenter the nucleus, where their cognate heterodimeric (TR-RXR;\nsee Figure 42\u201312) receptors are already bound to the appropriate\nresponse elements with an associated transcription corepressor com-\nplex ( red circles ). Binding of hormones occurs, which again induces\nconformational changes in the receptor leading to dissociation of the\ncorepressor complex from the receptor, thereby allowing an activator\ncomplex, consisting of the TR-TRE and coactivator, to assemble.

Consen-\nsus sequences for various HREs are shown in Table 42\u20131 . The\nliganded DNA-bound receptor serves as a high-affinity binding\ntarget for one or more transcriptional coactivator proteins, and\naccelerated gene transcription typically ensues when this occurs.\nBy contrast, certain hormones such as the thyroid hormones and\nretinoids diffuse from the extracellular fluid across the plasma\nmembrane and go directly into the nucleus. In this case, the cog-\nnate receptor is already bound to the HRE (the thyroid hormone\nresponse element [TRE], in this example). However, this DNA-\nbound receptor fails to activate transcription because it exists in\ncomplex with a corepressor. Indeed, this receptor-corepressor\ncomplex serves as a tonic repressor of gene transcription. Asso-\nciation of ligand with these receptors results in dissociation of\nthe corepressor(s). The liganded receptor is now capable of bind-\ning one or more coactivators with high affinity, resulting in the\nrecruitment of RNA polymerase II and the GTFs and activation\nof gene transcription as noted earlier for the GR-GRE complex.\nThe relationship of hormone receptors to other nuclear receptors\nand to coregulators is discussed in more detail later.\nBy selectively affecting gene transcription and the conse-\nquent production of appropriate target mRNAs, the amounts\nof specific proteins are changed and metabolic processes areinfluenced. The influence of each of these hormones is quite\nspecific; generally, a given hormone directly affects less than 1%\nof the genes, mRNA, or proteins in a target cell; sometimes only\na few genes are affected. The nuclear actions of steroid, thyroid,\nand retinoid hormones are quite well defined. Most evidence\nsuggests that these hormones exert their dominant effect on\nmodulating gene transcription, but they\u2014and many of the hor-\nmones in the other classes discussed later\u2014can act at any step of\nthe \u201cinformation pathway, \u201d as illustrated in Figure 42\u20133 , to con-\ntrol specific gene expression and, ultimately, a biologic response.\nDirect actions of steroids in the cytoplasm and on various\norganelles and membranes have also been described.

The mechanism of action\nof this group of hormones can best be discussed in terms of\ntheintracellular signals they generate. These signals include\ncAMP (cyclic AMP; 3 \u2032,5\u2032-adenylic acid; see Figure 18\u20135), a\nnucleotide derived from ATP through the action of adenylyl\ncyclase; cGMP , a nucleotide formed from GTP by guanylyl\ncyclase; Ca2+; and phosphatidylinositides ; such small mol-\necules are termed second messengers as their synthesis is\ntriggered by the presence of the primary hormone (molecule)Nucleus\nCytoplasmGene\nP\nrimary transcript\nMODIFICATION/PROCESSING\nTRANSPORTDegradation\nDegradation\nModification and\ndegradationmRNA\nActive  inactive mRNA\nProteinTRANSCRIPTION\nTRANSLATION\nFIGURE 42\u20133 The \u201cinformation pathway. \u201d Information flows\nfrom the gene to the primary transcript to mRNA to protein.

These receptors typically have seven\n\u03b1-helical hydrophobic plasma membrane-spanning domains,\nhere illustrated by the seven interconnected cylinders extend-\ning through the lipid bilayer in Figure 42\u20134 . Receptors of\nthis class, which signal through G-proteins, are known as\nG-protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) . To date, hundreds\nofGPCR genes have been identified, and represent the largest\nfamily of cell surface receptors in humans.

G-proteins are encoded by at least 10\ndifferent genes ( Table 42\u20133 ). Two parallel systems, a stimula-\ntory (s) one and an inhibitory (i) one, converge on a catalytic\nmolecule (C). Each consists of a receptor, Rsor Ri, and a regu-\nlato\nry G-protein complex termed Gsand Gi. Both Gsand Giarehetero\ntrimeric G-proteins composed of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits .\nSince the \u03b1 subunit in Gsdiffers from that in Gi, the proteins,\nwhich \nare distinct gene products, are designated \u03b1sand \u03b1i.

The binding of a hormone to Rsor Ri\nresults \nin a receptor-mediated activation of G-protein, which\nentails the exchange of GDP by GTP on \u03b1 and the concomitant\ndissociation of \u03b2\u03b3 from \u03b1.C\nNo hormone (H): Inactive effector( E) Bound hormone (H): Active effector (E)N N\nE\nE\nCH\nGDPGTP\nFIGURE 42\u20134 Components of the hormone receptor\u2013G-protein effector system.

In the\nabsence of hormone ( left), the heterotrimeric G-protein complex (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3) is in an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form and is\nprobably not associated with the receptor. This complex is anchored to the plasma membrane through prenylated groups on the \u03b2\u03b3 subunits\n(wavy lines ) and perhaps by myristoylated groups on \u03b1 subunits (not shown).

This activation results from the exchange of GDP with guanosine triphosphate\n(GTP) on the \u03b1 subunit, after which \u03b1 and \u03b2\u03b3 dissociate. The \u03b1 subunit binds to and activates the effector (E).

The G-protein family is classi-\nfied according to sequence homology into four subfamilies, as\nillustrated in Table 42\u20133. There are 21 \u03b1, 5 \u03b2, and 8 \u03b3 subunit\ngenes. Various combinations of these subunits provide a large\nnumber of possible \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 complexes.\nThe \u03b1 subunits and the \u03b2\u03b3 complex have actions inde-\npendent of those on adenylyl cyclase (see Figure 42\u20134 and\nTable 42\u20133).

Notable examples include\nolfaction (\u03b1OLF) and vision (\u03b1t). Some examples are listed inTable 42\u20133.

By\ncontrast, in eukaryotic cells, cAMP binds to a protein kinase\ncalled protein kinase A (PKA) , a heterotetrameric molecule\nconsisting of two regulatory subunits (R) that inhibit the activ-\nity of the two catalytic subunits (C) when bound as a tetra-\nmeric complex. cAMP binding to the R2C2tetramer res ults in\nthe following reaction:\n4cAMP + R2C2\u21c4R2-4cAMP + 2C\nThe \nR2C2complex has no enzymatic activity, but the\nbinding of cAMP to the R subunit induces dissociation of\nthe R-C complex, thereby activating the latter ( Figure 42\u20135 ).\nThe active C subunit catalyzes the transfer of the \u03b3 phos-\nphate of ATP to a serine or threonine residue in a variety\nof proteins. The consensus PKA phosphorylation sites are\n-ArgArg/Lys-X-Ser/Thr- and -Arg-Lys-X-X-Ser-, where X\ncan be any amino acid.\nHistorically protein kinase activities were described as\nbeing \u201ccAMP-dependent\u201d or \u201ccAMP-independent. \u201d This classi-\nfication has changed, as protein phosphorylation is now recog-\nnized as being a major and ubiquitous regulatory mechanism.TABLE 42\u20133 Classes & Functions of Selected G-Proteinsa\nClass or Type Stimulus Effector Effect\nGs\n\u03b1sGlucagon, \u03b2-adrenergics \u2191Adenylyl cyclase Glyconeogenesis, lipolysis, glycogenolysis\n\u2191Cardiac Ca2+, Cl\u2013, and Na+channels Olfaction\n\u03b1olfOdorant \u2191Adenylyl cyclase\nGi\n\u03b1i-1,2,3Acetylcholine, \u03b12-adrenergics \u2193Adenylyl cyclase Slowed heart rate\n\u2191Potassium channels\nM2cholinergics \u2193Calcium channels\n\u03b1oOpioids, endorphins \u2191Potassium channels Neuronal electrical activity\n\u03b1tLight \u2191Cgmp phosphodiesterase Vision\nGq\n\u03b1qM1cholinergics\n\u03b11-Adrenergics \u2191Phospholipase C-\u03b21 \u2193Muscle contraction\n\u03b111\u03b11-Adrenergics \u2191Phospholipase C-\u03b22 \u2193Blood pressure\nG12\n\u03b112Thrombin Rho Cell shape changes\naThe four major classes or families of mammalian G-proteins (Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12) are based on protein sequence conservation.

            "Text": "CHAPTER 42 Hormone Action & Signal Transduction 513\nSever\nal hundred protein kinases have now been described.\nThese kinases are related in sequence and structure within the\ncatalytic domain, but each is a unique molecule with consider-\nable variability with respect to subunit composition, molecular\nweight, autophosphorylation, Kmfo r ATP , and substrate specific-\nity. Both kinase and protein phosphatase activities can be targeted\nby interaction with specific kinase-binding proteins. In the case\nof PKA, such targeting proteins are termed A kinase anchoring\nproteins , orAKAPs . AKAPs serve as scaffolds, which localize\nPKA near to substrates thereby focusing PKA activity toward\nphysiologic substrates and facilitating spatiotemporal biologic\nregulation while also allowing for common, shared proteins to\nelicit specific physiologic responses. Multiple AKAPs have been\ndescribed and importantly they can bind PKA and other kinases\nas well as phosphatases, phosphodiesterases (which hydrolyze\ncAMP), and protein kinase substrates. The multifunctionality\nof AKAPs facilitates signaling localization, rate (production and\ndestruction of signals), specificity, and dynamics.\nPhosphoproteins\nThe effects of cAMP in eukaryotic cells are all thought to be\nmediated \nby protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,\nprincipally on serine and threonine residues. The control of\nany of the effects of cAMP , including such diverse processesas steroidogenesis, secretion, ion transport, carbohydrate and\nfat metabolism, enzyme induction, gene regulation, synaptic\ntransmission, and cell growth and replication, could be con-\nferred by a specific protein kinase, by a specific phosphatase,\nor by specific substrates for phosphorylation. The array of spe-\ncific substrates contributes critically to defining a target tissue,\nand are involved in defining the extent of a particular response\nwithin a given cell. For example, the effects of cAMP on gene\ntranscription are mediated by the cyclic AMP response ele-\nment binding protein (CREB). When CREB binds to a cAMP\nresponsive DNA enhancer element (CRE ) (see Table 42\u20131)\nin its nonphosphorylated state, it is a weak activator of\ntranscription. However, when phosphorylated by PKA at key\namino acids, CREB binds the coactivator CREB-binding\nprotein CBP/p300 (see later) and as a result is a much more\npotent transcriptional activator. CBP and the related p300\ncontain histone acetyltransferase activities (HATs) , and\nhence serve as chromatin-active transcriptional coregulators\n(see Chapters 36, 38). Interestingly, CBP/p300 can also acety-\nlate certain transcription factors thereby stimulating their\nability to bind DNA and modulate transcription.\nPhosphodiesterases\nActions caused by hormones that increase cAMP concen-\ntration \ncan be terminated in a number of ways, including\nthe hydrolysis of cAMP to 5 \u2032-AMP by phosphodiesterases\n(see Figure 42\u20135). The presence of these hydrolytic enzymes\nensures a rapid turnover of the signal (cAMP) and hence a\nrapid termination of the biologic process once the hormonal\nstimulus is removed. There are at least 11 known members\nof the phosphodiesterase family of enzymes. These are sub-\nject to regulation by their substrates, cAMP and cGMP; by\nhormones; and by intracellular messengers such as calcium,\nprobably acting through calmodulin. Inhibitors of phospho-\ndiesterase, most notably methylated xanthine derivatives such\nas caffeine, increase intracellular cAMP and mimic or prolong\nthe actions of hormones through this signal.\nPhosphoprotein Phosphatases\nGiven the importance of protein phosphorylation, it is not\nsu\nrprising that regulation of the protein dephosphoryla-\ntion reaction is another important control mechanism\n(see Figure 42\u20135). The phosphoprotein phosphatases are\nthemselves subject to regulation by phosphorylation-\ndephosphorylation reactions and by a variety of other\nmechanisms, such as protein\u2013protein interactions. In fact,\nthe substrate specificity of the phosphoserine-phosphothre-\nonine phosphatases may be dictated by distinct regulatory\nsubunits whose binding is regulated hormonally. One of the\nbest-studied roles of regulation by the dephosphorylation\nof proteins is that of glycogen metabolism in muscle (see\nFigures 18\u20136 to 18\u20138). Two major types of phosphoserine-\nphosphothreonine phosphatases have been described. Type I\npreferentially dephosphorylates the \u03b2 subunit of phosphorylase\nkinase, whereas type II dephosphorylates the \u03b1 subunit.

The cAMP generated by the\naction of adenylyl cyclase (activated as shown in Figure 42\u20134) binds\nto the regulatory subunit of PKA. This results in dissociation of the\nregulatory and catalytic subunits and activation of the latter. The\nactive catalytic subunits phosphorylate a number of target proteins\non serine and threonine residues. Phosphatases remove phosphate\nfrom these residues and thus terminate the physiologic response. A\nphosphodiesterase can also terminate the response by converting\ncAMP to 5 \u2032-AMP ."

This\nph\nosphatase is itself regulated by phosphorylation of cer-\ntain of its subunits, and these reactions are reversed by the\naction of one of the type II phosphatases. In addition, two\nheat-stable protein inhibitors regulate type I phosphatase\nactivity. Inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated and activated by\ncAMP-dependent protein kinases, and inhibitor-2, which\nmay be a subunit of the inactive phosphatase, is also phos-\nphorylated, possibly by glycogen synthase kinase-3. Phos-\nphatases that target phosphotyrosine are also important in\nsignal transduction (see Figure 42\u20138).\ncGMP Is Also an Intracellular Signal\nCyclic GMP is made from GTP by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase,\nwhic\nh exists in soluble and membrane-bound forms. Each of\nthese enzyme forms has unique physiologic properties. The atri-\nopeptins, a family of peptides produced in cardiac atrial tissues,\ncause natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of aldo-\nsterone secretion. These peptides (eg, atrial natriuretic factor)\nbind to and activate the membrane-bound form of guanylyl\ncyclase. Activation of guanylyl cyclase results in an increase of\ncGMP by as much as 50-fold in some cases, and this is thought\nto mediate the effects mentioned earlier. Other evidence links\ncGMP to vasodilation. A series of compounds, including nitro-\nprusside, nitroglycerin, nitric oxide, sodium nitrite, and sodium\nazide, all cause smooth muscle relaxation and are potent vaso-\ndilators. These agents increase cGMP by activating the soluble\nform of guanylyl cyclase, and inhibitors of cGMP phosphodi-\nesterase (eg, the drug sildenafil [Viagra]) enhance and prolong\nthese responses. The increased cGMP activates cGMP-dependent\nprotein kinase (PKG), which in turn phosphorylates a number\nof smooth muscle proteins. Presumably, this is involved in relax-\nation of smooth muscle and vasodilation.\nSeveral Hormones Act Through Calcium\nor \nPhosphatidylinositols\nIonized calcium, Ca2+, is an important regulator of a variety\nof cellular processes, \nincluding muscle contraction, stimulus-\nsecretion coupling, the blood clotting cascade, enzyme activ-\nity, and membrane excitability. Ca2+is also an intracellular\nmessenger of hormone action.\nCalcium Metabolism\nThe extracellular Ca2+concen tration is ~5 mmol/L and is very\nrigidly controlled. Although substantial amounts of calcium\nare associated with intracellular organelles such as mitochon-\ndria and the endoplasmic reticulum, the intracellular concen-\ntration of free or ionized calcium (Ca2+) is very low: 0.05 to\n10 \u03bcmol/L. In spite of this \nlarge concentration gradient and a\nfavorable transmembrane electrical gradient, Ca2+is restrained\nfrom entering the cell. A considerable amount of energy is\nexpended to ensure that the intracellular Ca2+is con trolled, as\na prolonged elevation of Ca2+in the cell is very toxic. A Na+/\nCa2+exchang e mechanism that has a high-capacity but low-\naffinity pumps Ca2+out of cells. There also is a Ca2+/protonA\nTPase-dependent pump that extrudes Ca2+in exchange for\nH+. This pump has a high affinity for Ca2+but a low capac-\nity and is probably responsible for fine-tuning cytosolic Ca2+.\nFurthermor\ne, Ca2+-ATPases pump Ca2+from the cytosol to\nthe lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. There are three ways\nof changing cytosolic Ca2+le vels: (1) Certain hormones\n(class II.C, Table 41\u20133) by binding to receptors that are them-\nselves Ca2+channels, enhance membrane permeability to Ca2+,\nand \nthereby increase Ca2+influx. (2) Hormones also indirectly\npromote Ca2+influx by modulating the membrane potential\nat the plasma membrane. Membrane depolarization opens\nvoltage-gated Ca2+channels and allows for Ca2+influx. (3) Ca2+\ncan \nbe mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum, and pos-\nsibly from mitochondrial pools.\nCalmodulin\nAn important observation linking Ca2+to hormone action\ninvolved the definition of the intracellular targets of Ca2+action.\nThe discovery of a Ca2+-dependent regulator of phosphodies-\nterase \nactivity provided the basis for a broad understanding\nof how Ca2+and cAMP interact within cells. The calcium-\ndependent regulatory protein is calmodulin, a 17-kDa protein\nthat is homologous to the muscle protein troponin C in struc-\nture and function. Calmodulin has four Ca2+-binding sites, and\nfull \noccupancy of these sites leads to a marked conformational\nchange, which allows calmodulin to activate enzymes and ion\nchannels. The interaction of Ca2+with calmodulin (with the\nresultant change of activity of the latter) is conceptually simi-\nlar to the binding of cAMP to PKA and the subsequent acti-\nvation of this molecule. Calmodulin can be one of numerous\nsubunits of complex proteins and is particularly involved in\nregulating various kinases and enzymes of cyclic nucleotide\ngeneration and degradation. A partial list of the enzymes regu-\nlated directly or indirectly by Ca2+, probably through calmod-\nulin, is \npresented in Table 42\u20134 .\nIn addition to its effects on enzymes and ion transport,\nCa2+/calmodulin regulates the activity of many structural ele-\nments \nin cells. These include the actin-myosin complex of\nsmooth muscle, which is under \u03b2-adrenergic control, and vari-\nous microfilament-mediated processes in noncontractile cells,\nincluding cell motility, cell conformation changes, mitosis,\ngranule release, and endocytosis.\nTABLE 42\u20134 Some Enzymes & Proteins Regulated by\nCalcium \nor Calmodulin\n\u2022Adenylyl cyclase\n\u2022Ca2+-dependent protein kinases\n\u2022Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase\n\u2022Ca2+-phospholipid\u2013dependent protein kinase\n\u2022Cycl\nic nucleotide phosphodiesterase\n\u2022Some cytoskeletal proteins\n\u2022Some ion channels (eg, l-type calcium channels)\n\u2022Nitric oxide synthase\n\u2022Phosphorylase kinase\n\u2022Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2B\n\u2022Some receptors (eg, NMDA-type glutamate receptor)\nAbbreviation: NDMA, N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor."

Again, the regulation of glycogen metabolism\nin liver (by vasopressin and \u03b2-adrenergic catecholamines; see\nFigures 18\u20136 and 18\u20137) Is instructive. A number of critical\nmetabolic enzymes are regulated by Ca2+, phosphorylation, or\nboth. \nThese include glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase, pyru-\nvate carboxylase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and\npyruvate dehydrogenase among others (see Figure 19\u20131).\nPhosphatidylinositide Metabolism Affects\nCa2+-Dependent Hormone Action\nSome signal must provide communication between the hor-\nmone r\neceptor on the plasma membrane and the intracellular\nCa2+reservoirs. Th is is accomplished by products of phospha-\ntidylinositol metabolism. Cell surface receptors such as thosefor acetylcholine, antidiuretic hormone, and \u03b11-type catechol-\namines ar\ne, when occupied by their respective ligands, potent\nactivators of phospholipase C. Receptor binding and activa-\ntion of phospholipase C are coupled by the Gqisoforms  (see\nTable 42\u20133 and Figure 42\u20136 ). Phospholipase C catalyzes the\nhydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to ino-\nsitol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diac ylglycerol (diacylgl-\ncerol, DAG ) (Figure 42\u20137 ). Diacylglycerol is itself capable of\nactivating protein kinase C (PKC), the activity of which also\ndepends on Ca2+(see Chapter 21 and Figures, 24\u20131, 24\u20132, and\n55\u20131).

In this scheme, the activated protein kinase\nC can phosphorylate specific substrates, which then alter\nphysiologic processes. Likewise, the Ca2+-calmodulin complex\ncan \nactivate specific kinases. These then modify substrates and\nthereby alter physiologic responses.\nSome Hormones Act Through a Protein\nKinase \nCascade\nSingle protein kinases such as PKA, PKC, and Ca2+-\ncalmodu\nlin-dependent kinases (CaMKs ), which result in\nthe phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in target\nproteins, play a very important role in hormone action. The\ndiscovery that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor\ncontains an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is activated\nby the binding of the ligand EGF was an important break-\nthrough. The insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-\n1) receptors also contain intrinsic ligand-activated tyrosine\nkinase activity. Several receptors\u2014generally those involved in\nbinding ligands that control cellular growth, differentiation,\nand the inflammatory response\u2014either have intrinsic tyrosine\nkinase activity or are tightly associated with proteins that are\ntyrosine kinases. Another distinguishing feature of this class\nof hormone action is that these kinases preferentially phos-\nphorylate tyrosine residues, and tyrosine phosphorylation is\ninfrequent (<0.03% of total amino acid phosphorylation) in\nmammalian cells. A third distinguishing feature is that the\nligand-receptor interaction that results in a tyrosine phos-\nphorylation event initiates a cascade that may involve several\nprotein kinases, phosphatases, and other regulatory proteins.Insulin Transmits Signals by Several Kinase\nCascades\nTheinsulin, EGF, and IGF-1 receptors have intrinsic protein\ntyrosine kinase activities located in their cytoplasmic domains.\nThese activities are stimulated when their ligands bind to the\ncognate receptor. The receptors are then autophosphorylated\non tyrosine residues, and this phosphorylation initiates a\ncomplex series of events (summarized in simplified fashion in\nFigure 42\u20138 ). The phosphorylated insulin receptor next phos-\nphorylates insulin receptor substrates (there are at least four\nof these molecules, called IRS 1-4 ) on tyrosine residues. Phos-\nphorylated IRS binds to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains\nof a variety of proteins that are directly involved in mediating\ndifferent effects of insulin. One of these proteins, PI-3 kinase,\nlinks insulin receptor activation to insulin action through\nactivation of a number of molecules, including the kinase\nphosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) . This enzyme\npropagates the signal through several other kinases, includ-\ningPKB (also known as AKT), SKG , and aPKC (see legend\nto Figure 42\u20138 for definitions and expanded abbreviations).\nAn alternative pathway downstream from PDK1 involves\np70S6K and perhaps other as yet unidentified kinases. A sec-\nond major pathway involves mTOR. This enzyme is directly\nregulated by amino acid levels and insulin and is essential for\np70S6K activity. The mTOR-signaling system provides a dis-\ntinction between the PKB and p70S6K branches downstream\nfrom PKD1. These pathways are involved in protein trans-\nlocation, enzyme activation, and the regulation, by insulin,\nof genes involved in metabolism (see Figure 42\u20138). Another\nSH2 domain\u2013containing protein is GRB2 , which binds to\nIRS-1 and links tyrosine phosphorylation to several proteins,\nthe result of which is activation of a cascade of threonine and\nserine kinases. A pathway showing how this insulin-receptor\ninteraction activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK ) pathway and the anabolic effects of insulin is illus-\ntrated in Figure 42\u20138. The exact roles of many of these docking\nproteins, kinases, and phosphatases are actively being studied.\nThe JAK/STAT Pathway Is Used by Hormones\nand \nCytokines\nTyrosine kinase activation can also initiate a phosphorylation\nand \ndephosphorylation cascade that involves the action of sev-\neral other protein kinases and the counterbalancing actions of\nphosphatases. Two mechanisms are employed to initiate this\ncascade. Some hormones, such as growth hormone, prolac-\ntin, erythropoietin, and the cytokines, initiate their action by\nactivating a tyrosine kinase, but this activity is not an integral\npart of the hormone receptor. The hormone-receptor interac-\ntion promotes binding and activation of cytoplasmic protein\ntyrosine kinases , such as the Janus kinases 1 and 2 ,JAK1 , or\nJAK2 , ortyrosine kinase 2 ,TYK2 .\nThese kinases phosphorylate one or more cytoplasmic pro-\nteins, which then associate with other docking proteins through\nbinding to SH2 domains.

The insulin signaling pathways provide an excellent example of the \u201crecognition -> hormone\nrelease -> signal generation -> effects\u201d paradigm outlined in Figure 42\u20131. Insulin is released into the bloodstream from pancreatic \u03b2 cells in\nresponse to hyperglycemia. Binding of insulin to a target cell-specific plasma membrane heterotetrameric insulin receptor (IR) results in a cas-\ncade of intracellular events. First, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is activated, and marks the initial event. Receptor\nactivation results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation (conversion of specific Y residues to Y-P) within the receptor. One or more of the insulin\nreceptor substrate (IRS) molecules (IRS 1-4) then bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor and themselves are specifically tyrosine\nphosphorylated. IRS proteins interact with the activated IR via N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains.\nIR-docked IRS proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated and the resulting P-Y residues form the docking sites for several additional signaling proteins\n(ie, PI-3 kinase, GRB2, and mTOR). GRB2 and PI-3K bind to IRS P-Y residues via their SH (Src homology) domains; binding to IRS-Y-P residues leads\nto activation of the activity of many intracellular signaling molecules such as GTPases, protein kinases, and lipid kinases, all of which play key roles\nin certain metabolic actions of insulin. The two best-described pathways are shown. In detail, phosphorylation of an IRS molecule results in\ndocking and activation of the lipid kinase, PI-3 kinase; PI-3K generates novel inositol lipids that act as \u201csecond messenger\u201dmolecules. These, in turn,\nactivate PDK1 and then a variety of downstream signaling molecules, including protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), SGK, and aPKC. An alternative path-\nway involves the activation of p70S6K and perhaps other as yet unidentified kinases. Next, additional phosphorylation of IRS results in docking of\nGRB2/mSOS and activation of the small GTPase, p21Ras, which initiates a protein kinase cascade that activates Raf-1, MEK, and the p42/p44 MAP\nkinase isoforms. These protein kinases are important in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of many cell types. The mTOR pathway\nprovides an alternative way of activating p70S6K and is involved in nutrient signaling as well as insulin action. Each of the indicated signaling\ncascades may influence different biologic processes, as shown (Protein Translocation, Protein/Enzyme Activity, Gene Transcription/Translation,\nCell Growth). All of the phosphorylation events are reversible through the action of specific phosphatases. As an example, the lipid phosphatase\nPTEN dephosphorylates the product of the PI-3 kinase reaction, thereby antagonizing the pathway and terminating the signal.

Their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory\nactions are explained in part by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB and\nits subsequent actions. Evidence for three mechanisms for the\ninhibition of NF-\u03baB by glucocorticoids has been described:\n(1) glucocorticoids increase I\u03baB mRNA, which leads to an\nincrease of I\u03baB protein and more efficient sequestration of\nNF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm. (2) The GR competes with NF-\u03baB for\nbinding to coactivators. (3) The GR directly binds to the p65\nsubunit of NF-\u03baB and inhibits its activation (see Figure 42\u201310).\nHORMONES CAN INFLUENCE\nSPECIFIC \nBIOLOGIC EFFECTS BY\nMODULATING TRANSCRIPTION\nThe signals generated as described earlier have to be trans-\nla\nted into an action that allows the cell to effectively adapt to\na physiologic challenge (see Figure 42\u20131). Much of this adap-\ntation is accomplished through alterations in the rates of tran-\nscription of specific genes. Many different observations have\nled to the current view of how hormones affect transcription.\nSome of these are as follows: (1) actively transcribed genes are\nin regions of \u201copen\u201d chromatin (experimentally defined as rela-\ntively high susceptibility to DNase I digestion, and containing\ncertain histone PTMs or \u201chistone marks\u201d), which allows for the\naccess of transcription factors to DNA. (2) Genes have regula-\ntory regions, and transcription factors bind to these to modulate\nthe frequency of transcription (initiation, promoter clearance,\nand elongation; see Chapters 36, 38). (3) The hormone-receptor\ncomplex can be one of these transcription factors. The DNA\nsequence to which receptors bind is called a HRE (see Table 42\u20131\nfor examples). (4) Alternatively, other hormone-generated sig-\nnals can modify the location, amount, or activity of transcrip-\ntion factors and thereby influence binding to the regulatory or\nresponse element. (5) Members of a large superfamily of nuclear\nreceptors act with\u2014or in a manner analogous to\u2014the hormone\nreceptors described earlier. (6) These nuclear receptors interact\nwith another large group of coregulatory molecules to effect\nchanges in the transcription of specific genes.\nSeveral HREs Have Been Defined\nHREs resemble enhancer elements in that they are not strictly\ndependent o\nn position and location or orientation. They gen-\nerally are found within a few hundred nucleotides upstream\n(5\u2032) of the transcription initiation site, but they may be located\nwithin the coding region of the gene, in introns. HREs were\ndefined by the strategy illustrated in Figure 38\u201311. The con-\nsensus sequences illustrated in Table 42\u20131 were arrived at\nthrough analysis of many genes regulated by a given hormone\nusing simple, heterologous reporter systems (see Figure 38\u201310)\ncoupled with genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipita-\ntion and bioinformatic analyses (see Chapter 39). Although\nthese simple HREs bind the hormone-receptor complex more\navidly than surrounding DNA\u2014or DNA from an unrelatedsource\u2014and confer hormone responsiveness to a reporter\ngene, it soon became apparent that the regulatory circuitry of\nnatural genes must be much more complicated. Glucocorti-\ncoids, progestins, mineralocorticoids, and androgens have\nvastly different physiologic actions. How could the specific-\nity required for these effects be achieved through regulation\nof gene expression by the same HRE (see Table 42\u20131)? Ques-\ntions like this have led to experiments which have allowed for\nelaboration of a more complex model of transcription regula-\ntion by the steroid hormone receptor family of proteins. For\nexample, in the vast majority of cellular genes, the HRE is\nfound associated with other specific regulatory DNA elements\n(and associated binding proteins); these associations are man-\ndatory for optimal function. The extensive sequence similar-\nity noted between steroid hormone receptors, particularly in\ntheir DNA-binding domains (DBD), led to discovery of the\nnuclear receptor superfamily of proteins. These\u2014and a large\nnumber of coregulator proteins \u2014allow for a wide variety of\nDNA\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein interactions and the speci-\nficity necessary for highly regulated physiologic control.

This family, now with more\nthan 50 members, includes the nuclear hormone receptors\ndiscussed earlier, a number of other receptors whose ligands\nwere discovered after the receptors were identified, and many\nputative, or orphan receptors, for which the regulatory physi-\nologic ligand has yet to be discovered.\nThese nuclear receptors have several common structural\nfeatures ( Figure 42\u201312 ). All have a centrally located DBD that\nallows the receptor to bind with high affinity to its cognate\nHRE. The DBD contains two zinc finger binding motifs (see\nFigure 38\u201314) that direct binding either as homodimers, as het-\nerodimers (usually with a retinoid X receptor [RXR] partner),\nor as monomers. The target response element consists of one\nor two DNA half-site consensus sequences arranged as an\ninverted or direct repeat. The spacing between the latter helps\ndetermine binding specificity. Thus, in general, a direct repeat\nwith three, four, or five nucleotide spacer regions specifies the\nbinding of the vitamin D, thyroid, and retinoic acid recep-\ntors, respectively, to the same consensus response element\n(Table 42\u20131). A multifunctional ligand-binding domain\n(LBD) is located in the carboxyl terminal half of the recep-\ntor. The LBD binds hormones or metabolites with selectivity\nand thus specifies a particular biologic response. The LBD\nalso contains domains that mediate the binding of heat shock\nproteins, dimerization, nuclear localization, and transactiva-\ntion. The latter function is facilitated by the carboxyl-terminal\ntranscription activation function, or activation domain/AD(AF-2 domain) , which forms a surface required for the inter-\naction with coactivators. A highly variable hinge region sepa-\nrates the DBD from the LBD. This region provides flexibility\nto the receptor, so it can assume different DNA-binding con-\nformations. Finally, there is a highly variable amino-terminal\nregion that contains another AD referred to as AF-1 . The AF-1\nAD likely provides for distinct physiologic functions through\nthe binding of different coregulator proteins. This region of\nthe receptor, through the use of different promoters, alterna-\ntive splice sites, and multiple translation initiation sites, pro-\nvides for receptor isoforms that share DBD and LBD identity\nbut exert different physiologic responses because of the asso-\nciation of various coregulators with this variable amino termi-\nnal AF-1 AD.\nIt is possible to sort this large number of receptors into\ngroups in a variety of ways. Here, they are discussed according\nto the way they bind to their respective DNA elements (see\nFigure 42\u201312). Classic hormone receptors for glucocorticoids\n(GR), mineralocorticoids (MR), estrogens (ER), androgens\n(AR), and progestins (PR) bind as homodimers to inverted\nrepeat sequences. Other hormone receptors such as thyroid\n(TR), retinoic acid (RAR), and vitamin D (VDR) and recep-\ntors that bind various metabolite ligands such as PPAR \u03b1, \u03b2,\nand \u03b3, FXR, LXR, PXR, and CAR bind as heterodimers, with\nRXR as a partner, to direct repeat sequences (see Figure 42\u201312\nandTable 42\u20135 ). Another group of orphan receptors that as\nyet have no known ligand bind as homodimers or monomers\nto direct repeat sequences.\nAs illustrated in Table 42\u20135, the discovery of the nuclear\nreceptor superfamily has led to an important understand-\ning of how a variety of metabolites and xenobiotics regulate\ngene expression and thus the metabolism, detoxification, and\nC N AF-1 DBDA/B\nGR, MR, PR\nAR, ERTR, RAR, VDR\nPPAR , ,\nFXR, CAR, LXR,\nPXR/SXRGCNF, TR4, LRH-1\nSF-1, TLX\nReceptors: Steroid class\nBinding: Homodimers\nLigand: Steroids\nDNA element: Inverted repeatRXR partnered\nHeterodimers\n9-Cis RA (x)\nDirect repeatsOrphans\nHomodimers\n?\nDirect repeatsLBD AF-2E F D C\nHinge\nFIGURE 42\u201312 The nuclear receptor superfamily.

The C domain consists of the\nDNA-binding domain (DBD). The D region contains the hinge, which provides flexibility between the DBD and the ligand-binding domain\n(LBD, region E). The C-terminal part of region E contains AF-2, another AD that also contributes importantly to activation of transcription. The F\nregion is less well defined.

There can be nucleotide spacers of one to five bases between these direct repeats (DR1-5; see Table 42\u20131 for more details). Another\nclass of receptors for which ligands have not been definitively determined (orphan receptors) bind as homodimers to direct repeats and occa-\nsionally as monomers to a single half-site."

They (1) bind nuclear receptors in\nan ago\nnist- and AF-2 AD-dependent manner, (2) have a con-\nserved amino terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif\n(see Chapter 38), (3) have a weak carboxyl-terminal transacti-\nvation domain and a stronger amino-terminal transactivation\ndomain in a region that is required for CBP-p160 interac-\ntion, (4) contain at least three of the LXXLL motifs required\nfor protein\u2013protein interaction with other coactivators, and\n(5) often have HAT activity. The role of HAT is particularly\ninteresting, as mutations of the HAT domain disable many of\nthese transcription factors. Current thinking holds that these\nHAT activities acetylate histones, which facilitate the remodel-\ning of chromatin into a transcription-efficient environment.\nHistone acetylation/deacetylation thus plays a critical role in\ngene expression. Finally, it is important to note that other pro-\ntein substrates for HAT-mediated acetylation, such as DNA-\nbinding transcription activators and other coregulators have\nbeen reported. Such nonhistone PTM events likely also factor\nimportantly into the overall regulatory response.\nA small number of proteins, including NCoR andSMRT ,\ncomprise the corepressor family . They function, at least in\npart, as described in Figure 42\u20132. Another family includes the\nTRAPs, DRIPs, and ARC (see Table 42\u20136). These proteins rep-\nresent subunits of the mediator (see Chapter 36) and range in\nsize from 80 to 240 kDa and are thought to link the nuclear\nreceptor-coactivator complex to RNA polymerase II and the\nother components of the basal transcription apparatus.\nThe exact role of these coactivators is presently under\nintensive investigation. Many of these proteins have intrinsic\nenzymatic activities. This is particularly interesting in view\nof the fact that acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation,\nsumoylation, and ubiquitination\u2014as well as proteolysis and\ncellular translocation\u2014have been proposed to alter the activ-\nity of some of these coregulators and their targets.\nIt appears that certain combinations of coregulators\u2014and\nthus different combinations of activators and inhibitors\u2014are\nresponsible for specific ligand-induced actions through various\nreceptors. Furthermore, these interactions on a given promoter\nare dynamic. In some cases, complexes consisting of over 45\ntranscription factors have been observed on a single gene.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Hormones, cytokines, interleukins, and growth factors use a\nvariety o\nf signaling mechanisms to facilitate cellular adaptive\nresponses.\n\u25a0The ligand-receptor complex serves as the initial signal for\nmembers \nof the nuclear receptor family.\n\u25a0Class II peptide/protein and catecholamine hormones,\nwhich bin\nd to cell surface receptors, generate a variety of\nintracellular signals. These include cAMP , cGMP , Ca2+,\nphospha\ntidylinositides, and protein kinase cascades.\n\u25a0Many hormone responses are accomplished through alterations\nin the \nrate of transcription of specific genes.\n\u25a0The nuclear receptor superfamily of proteins plays a central\nrole \nin the regulation of gene transcription.TABLE 42\u20136 Some Mammalian Coregulator Proteins\nI. 300-kDa family of coactivators\nA. \nCBP CREB-binding protein\nB. p300 Protein of 300 kDa\nII. 160-kDa family of coactivators\nA.

Some of the many actions of CBP/p300,\nwhich appear to depend on intrinsic enzyme activities and its\nability to serve as a scaffold for the binding of other proteins,\nare illustrated in Figure 42\u201311. Other coregulators serve simi-\nlar functions.\nSeveral other families of coactivator molecules have been\ndescribed. Members of the p160 family of coactivators , all of\nabout 160 kDa, include (1) SRC-1 and NCoA-1; (2) GRIP 1,\nTIF2, and NCoA-2; and (3) p/CIP , ACTR, AIB1, RAC3, and\nTRAM-1 ( Table 42\u20136 ).

Glucose and galactose\nhave an index o\ue037 1 (or 100%), as do lactose, maltose, isomalt-\nose, and trehalose, which give rise to these monosaccharides\non hydrolysis. Fructose and the sugar alcohols are absorbed\nless rapidly and have a lower glycemic index, as does sucrose.\n\ue02ehe glycemic index o\ue037 starch varies between near 1 (or 100%)\nand near 0 as a result o\ue037 variable rates o\ue037 hydrolysis, and that o\ue037\nnonstarch polysaccharides (see Figure 15\u201313) is 0. Foods that\nhave a low glycemic index are considered to be more bene\ue037icial\nsince they cause less \ue037luctuation in insulin secretion. Resistant\nstarch and nonstarch polysaccharides provide substrates \ue037or\nbacterial \ue037ermentation in the large intestine, and the resultant\nbutyrate and other short-chain \ue037atty acids provide a signi\ue037i-\ncant source o\ue037 \ue037uel \ue037or intestinal enterocytes. \ue02ehere is evidence\nthat butyrate also has antiproli\ue037erative activity, and so provides\nprotection against colorectal cancer.\nAmylases Catalyze the\nHydroly\nsis of Starch\n\ue02ehe hydrolysis o\ue037 starch is catalyzed by salivary and pancre-\natic \namylases, which catalyze random hydrolysis o\ue037 \u03b1(1 \u21924)\nglycoside bonds, yielding dextrins, then a mixture o\ue037 glucose,\nmaltose, and maltotriose and small branched dextrins (\ue037rom\nthe branchpoints in amylopectin, Figure 15\u201312).\nDisaccharidases Are Brush\nBorder \nEnzymes\n\ue02ehe disaccharidases, maltase, sucrase-isomaltase (a bi\ue037unctional\nen\nzyme catalyzing hydrolysis o\ue037 sucrose and isomaltose),\nlactase, and trehalase are located on the brush border o\ue037 the\nintestinal mucosal cells, where the resultant monosaccharides\nand those directly ingested are absorbed. Congenital de\ue037iciency\no\ue037 lactase occurs rarely in in\ue037ants, leading to lactose intolerance\nand \ue037ailure to thrive when \ue037ed on breast milk or normal in\ue037ant\n\ue037ormula. Congenital de\ue037iciency o\ue037 sucrase-isomaltase occurs\namong the Inuit, leading to sucrose intolerance, with per-\nsistent diarrhea and \ue037ailure to thrive when the diet contains\nsucrose.\nIn most mammals, and most human beings, lactase activ-\nity begins to \ue037all a\ue037ter weaning and is almost completely lost\nby late adolescence, leading to lactose intolerance . Lactose\nremains in the intestinal lumen, where it is a substrate \ue037or\nbacterial \ue037ermentation to lactate, resulting in abdominal dis-\ncom\ue037ort and diarrhea a\ue037ter consumption o\ue037 relatively large\namounts. In two population groups, people o\ue037 north European\norigin and nomadic tribes o\ue037 sub-Saharan A\ue037rica and Arabia,lactase persists a\ue037ter weaning and into adult li\ue037e. Marine mam-\nmals secrete a high-\ue037at milk that contains no carbohydrate,\nand their pups lack lactase.\nThere Are Two Separate Mechanisms\nfor \nthe Absorption of Monosaccharides\nin the Small Intestine\nGlucose and galactose are absorbed by a sodium-dependent\nprocess. \n\ue02ehey are carried by the same transport protein\n(SGL\ue02e 1) and compete with each other \ue037or intestinal absorp-\ntion ( Figure 43\u20131 ). Other monosaccharides are absorbed\nby carrier-mediated di\ue037\ue037usion. Because they are not actively\ntransported, \ue037ructose and sugar alcohols are only absorbed\ndown their concentration gradient, and a\ue037ter a moderately\nhigh intake, some may remain in the intestinal lumen, acting\nas a substrate \ue037or bacterial \ue037ermentation. Large intakes o\ue037 \ue037ruc-\ntose and sugar alcohols can lead to osmotic diarrhea.\nDIGESTION & ABSORPTION\nOF \nLIPIDS\n\ue02ehe major lipids in the diet are triacylglycerols and, to a lesser\nextent, \nphospholipids. \ue02ehese are hydrophobic molecules and\nhave to be hydrolyzed and emulsi\ue037ied to very small droplets\nGlucose\nGalactoseGlucose\nGalactose\nF\nructoseGlucoseSGLT 1\ntransporter\nprotein\nGlucose\nFructose\nGalactose\nT o capillaries GLUT 2Brush\nborder\nIntestinal\nepitheliumGLUT 5\nATP\nADP\n+ PiNa+\nNa+-K+\npump\nNa+\n3Na+\n2K+2K+\nFIGURE 43\u20131 Transport of glucose, fructose, and galac-\ntose \nacross the intestinal epithelium.

Absorption o\ue037 carotenes and \ue037at-\nsoluble vitamins is impaired on a very low-\ue037at diet.\nHydrolysis o\ue037 triacylglycerols is initiated by lingual and\ngastric lipases, which attack the sn-3 ester bond \ue037orming\n1,2-diacylglycerols and \ue037ree \ue037atty acids, which act as emulsi\ue037y-\ning agents.

Inhibitors o\ue037 pancreatic lipase are\nused to inhibit triacylglycerol hydrolysis in the treatment\no\ue037 severe obesity. Pancreatic esterase in the intestinal lumen\nhydrolyzes monoacylglycerols, but they are poor substrates,\nand only ~25% o\ue037 ingested triacylglycerol is completely\nhydrolyzed to glycerol and \ue037atty acids be\ue037ore absorption\n(Figure 43\u20132 ). Bile salts, \ue037ormed in the liver and secreted in\nthe bile, permit emulsi\ue037ication o\ue037 the products o\ue037 lipid diges-\ntion into micelles together with dietary phospholipids and\ncholesterol secreted in the bile (about 2 g/d) as well as dietary\ncholesterol (about 0.5 g/d). Micelles are less than 1 \u03bcm in\ndiameter, and soluble, so they allow the products o\ue037 digestion,\nincluding the \ue037at-soluble vitamins, being transported through\nthe aqueous environment o\ue037 the intestinal lumen to come\ninto close contact with the brush border o\ue037 the mucosal cells,\nallowing uptake into the epithelium. \ue02ehe bile salts remain in\nthe intestinal lumen, where most are absorbed \ue037rom the ileum\ninto the enterohepatic circulation (see Chapter 26).\nWithin the intestinal epithelium, 1-monoacyglycerols are\nhydrolyzed to \ue037atty acids and glycerol and 2-monoacylglycerols\nare reacylated to triacylglycerols via the monoacylglycerol\npathway . Glycerol released in the intestinal lumen is absorbed\ninto the hepatic portal vein; glycerol released within the epithe-\nlium is reutilized \ue037or triacylglycerol synthesis via the normal\nphosphatidic acid pathway (see Chapter 24). Long-chain \ue037atty\nacids are esteri\ue037ied to triacylglycerol in the mucosal cells and\ntogether with the other products o\ue037 lipid digestion, secreted as\nchylomicrons into the lymphatics, entering the bloodstream\nvia the thoracic duct (see Chapter 25). Short- and medium-\nchain \ue037atty acids are mainly absorbed into the hepatic portal\nvein as \ue037ree \ue037atty acids.\nCholesterol is absorbed dissolved in lipid micelles and is\nmainly esteri\ue037ied in the intestinal mucosa be\ue037ore being incorpo-\nrated into chylomicrons. Plant sterols and stanols (in which the\nB ring is saturated) compete with cholesterol \ue037or esteri\ue037ication,\nbut are poor substrates, so that there is an increased amount\no\ue037 unesteri\ue037ied cholesterol in the mucosal cells. Unesteri\ue037ied\ncholesterol and other sterols are actively transported out o\ue037 the\nmucosal cells into the intestinal lumen. \ue02ehis means that plant\nsterols and stanols e\ue037\ue037ectively inhibit the absorption o\ue037 not only\ndietary cholesterol, but also the larger amount that is secreted\nin the bile, so lowering the whole body cholesterol content, and\nhence the plasma cholesterol concentration.DIGESTION & ABSORPTION\nOF \nPROTEINS\nNative proteins are resistant to digestion because \ue037ew peptide\nbonds are accessible to the pro\nteolytic enzymes without prior\ndenaturation by heat in cooking and by the action o\ue037 gastric\nacid.\nSeveral Groups of Enzymes Catalyze\nthe \nDigestion of Proteins\n\ue02ehere are two main classes o\ue037 proteolytic digestive enzymes\n(pr\noteases) , with di\ue037\ue037erent speci\ue037icities \ue037or the amino acids\n\ue037orming the peptide bond to be hydrolyzed. Endopeptidases\nhydrolyze peptide bonds between speci\ue037ic amino acids through-\nout the molecule. \ue02ehey are the \ue037irst enzymes to act, yielding a\nlarger number o\ue037 smaller \ue037ragments. Pepsin in the gastric juice\ncatalyzes hydrolysis o\ue037 peptide bonds adjacent to amino acids\nwith bulky side-chains (aromatic and branched-chain amino\nacids and methionine). \ue02erypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are\nsecreted into the small intestine by the pancreas. \ue02erypsin cata-\nlyzes hydrolysis o\ue037 lysine and arginine amides, chymotrypsin\namides o\ue037 aromatic amino acids, and elastase amides o\ue037 small\nneutral aliphatic amino acids. Exopeptidases catalyze the\nhydrolysis o\ue037 peptide bonds, one at a time, \ue037rom the ends o\ue037\npeptides. Carboxypeptidases , secreted in the pancreatic juice,\nrelease amino acids \ue037rom the \ue037ree carboxyl terminal; amino-\npeptidases , secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells, release\namino acids \ue037rom the amino terminal. Dipeptidases and\ntripeptidases in the brush border o\ue037 intestinal mucosal cells\ncatalyze the hydrolysis o\ue037 di- and tripeptides, which are not\nsubstrates \ue037or amino- and carboxypeptidases.\n\ue02ehe proteases are secreted as inactive zymogens ; the active\nsite o\ue037 the enzyme is masked by a small region o\ue037 the peptide\nchain that is removed by hydrolysis o\ue037 a speci\ue037ic peptide bond.\nPepsinogen is activated to pepsin by gastric acid and by acti-\nvated pepsin. In the small intestine, trypsinogen, the precursor\no\ue037 trypsin, is activated by enteropeptidase, which is secreted by\nthe duodenal epithelial cells; trypsin can then activate chymo-\ntrypsinogen to chymotrypsin, proelastase to elastase, procar-\nboxypeptidase to carboxypeptidase, and proaminopeptidase\nto aminopeptidase.\nFree Amino Acids & Small Peptides Are\nAbsorbed \nby Different Mechanisms\n\ue02ehe end product o\ue037 the action o\ue037 endopeptidases and exopepti-\nda\nses is a mixture o\ue037 \ue037ree amino acids, di- and tripeptides, and\noligopeptides, all o\ue037 which are absorbed. Free amino acids are\nabsorbed across the intestinal mucosa by sodium-dependent\nactive transport. \ue02ehere are several di\ue037\ue037erent amino acid transport-\ners, with speci\ue037icity \ue037or the nature o\ue037 the amino acid side chain\n(large or small, neutral, acidic, or basic). \ue02ehe amino acids carried\nby any one transporter compete with each other \ue037or absorption\nand tissue uptake. Dipeptides and tripeptides enter the brush\nborder o\ue037 the intestinal mucosal cells, where they are hydrolyzed"

Not only have the body\u2019s\n\ue037at reserves been exhausted, but there is wastage o\ue037 muscle as\nwell, and as the condition progresses, there is loss o\ue037 protein\n\ue037rom the heart, liver, and kidneys. \ue02ehe amino acids released\nby the catabolism o\ue037 tissue proteins are used as a source o\ue037\nmetabolic \ue037uel and as substrates \ue037or gluconeogenesis to main-\ntain a supply o\ue037 glucose \ue037or the brain and red blood cells (see\nChapter 20). As a result o\ue037 the reduced synthesis o\ue037 proteins,\nthere is impaired immune response and increased risk o\ue037\nin\ue037ection. Impairment o\ue037 cell proli\ue037eration in the intestinal\nmucosa occurs, resulting in reduction in the sur\ue037ace area o\ue037\nthe intestinal mucosa, and reduction in the absorption o\ue037 such\nnutrients as are available.\nPatients With Advanced Cancer and\nAIDS \nAre Often Malnourished\nPatients with advanced cancer, HIV in\ue037ection and AIDS, and\na n\number o\ue037 other chronic diseases are \ue037requently undernour-\nished, a condition called cachexia . Physically, they show all the\nsigns o\ue037 marasmus, but there is considerably more loss o\ue037 body\nprotein than occurs in starvation. Unlike marasmus, where\nprotein synthesis is reduced, but catabolism is una\ue037\ue037ected, in\ncachexia the secretion o\ue037 cytokines in response to in\ue037ection\nand cancer increases the catabolism o\ue037 tissue protein by the\nA\ue02eP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, so increasing\nenergy expenditure. Patients are hypermetabolic , that is, they\nhave a considerably increased BMR. In addition to activation\no\ue037 the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway o\ue037 protein catabolism,\nthree other \ue037actors are involved. Many tumors metabolize\nglucose anaerobically to release lactate. \ue02ehis is then used\n\ue037or gluconeogenesis in the liver, which is energy consuming\nwith a net cost o\ue037 six A\ue02eP \ue037or each mol o\ue037 glucose cycled (see\nFigure 19\u20134). \ue02ehere is increased stimulation o\ue037 mitochondrial\nuncoupling proteins bycytokines leading to thermogenesis\nand increased oxidation o\ue037 metabolic \ue037uels. Futile cycling of\nlipids occurs because hormone-sensitive lipase is activated by\na proteoglycan secreted by tumors, resulting in liberation o\ue037\n\ue037atty acids \ue037rom adipose tissue and A\ue02eP-expensive reesteri\ue037i-\ncation to triacylglycerols in the liver, which are exported in\nvery-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).\nKwashiorkor Affects Undernourished\nChildren\nIn addition to the wasting o\ue037 muscle tissue, loss o\ue037 intestinal\nmucosa \nand impaired immune responses seen in marasmus,\nchildren with kwashiorkor show a number o\ue037 characteris-\ntic \ue037eatures. \ue02ehe de\ue037ining \ue037eature is edema , associated with a\ndecreased concentration o\ue037 plasma proteins. In addition, there\nis enlargement o\ue037 the liver as a result o\ue037 accumulation o\ue037 \ue037at.\nIt was \ue037ormerly believed that the cause o\ue037 kwashiorkor was a\nlack o\ue037 protein, with a more or less adequate energy intake;however, analysis o\ue037 the diets o\ue037 a\ue037\ue037ected children shows that\nthis is not so. Protein de\ue037iciency leads to stunting o\ue037 growth,\nand children with kwashiorkor are less stunted than those with\nmarasmus. Furthermore, the edema begins to improve early in\ntreatment, when the child is still receiving a low-protein diet.\nVery commonly, an in\ue037ection precipitates kwashiorkor.\nSuperimposed on general \ue037ood de\ue037iciency, there is probably a\nde\ue037iciency o\ue037 antioxidant nutrients such as zinc, copper, caro-\ntene, and vitamins C and E. \ue02ehe respiratory burst in response\nto in\ue037ection leads to the production o\ue037 oxygen and halogen\nfree radicals as part o\ue037 the cytotoxic action o\ue037 stimulated mac-\nrophages. \ue02ehis added oxidant stress triggers the development\no\ue037 kwashiorkor.\nPROTEIN & AMINO ACID\nREQUIREMENTS\nProtein Requirements Can\nBe \nDetermined by Measuring\nNitrogen Balance\n\ue02ehe state o\ue037 protein nutrition can be determined by measur-\ning \nthe dietary intake and output o\ue037 nitrogenous compounds\n\ue037rom the body. Although nucleic acids also contain nitro-\ngen, protein is the major dietary source o\ue037 nitrogen and\nmeasurement o\ue037 total nitrogen intake gives a good estimate\no\ue037 protein intake (mg N \u00d7 6.25 = mg protein, as N is 16% o\ue037\nmost proteins). \ue02ehe output o\ue037 N \ue037rom the body is mainly in\nurea and smaller quantities o\ue037 other compounds in urine,\nundigested protein (including digestive enzymes and shed\nintestinal mucosal cells) in \ue037eces; signi\ue037icant amounts may also\nbe lost in sweat and shed skin. \ue02ehe di\ue037\ue037erence between intake\nand output o\ue037 nitrogenous compounds is known as nitrogen\nbalance . \ue02ehree states can be de\ue037ined. In a healthy adult, there\nis nitrogen equilibrium ; intake equals output, and there is\nno change in the total body content o\ue037 protein. In a growing\nchild, a pregnant woman, or a person in recovery \ue037rom protein\nloss, the excretion o\ue037 nitrogenous compounds is less than the\ndietary intake and there is net retention o\ue037 nitrogen in the body\nas protein\u2014 positive nitrogen balance . In response to trauma\nor in\ue037ection, or i\ue037 the intake o\ue037 protein is inadequate to meet\nrequirements, there is net loss o\ue037 protein nitrogen \ue037rom the\nbody\u2014 negative nitrogen balance . Except when replacing pro-\ntein losses, nitrogen equilibrium can be maintained at any level\no\ue037 protein intake above requirements. A high intake o\ue037 protein\ndoes not lead to positive nitrogen balance; although it increases\nthe rate o\ue037 protein synthesis, it also increases the rate o\ue037 protein\ncatabolism, so that nitrogen equilibrium is maintained, albeit\nwith a higher rate o\ue037 protein turnover. Both protein synthesis\nand catabolism are A\ue02eP expensive, and this increased rate o\ue037\nprotein turnover explains the increased diet-induced thermo-\ngenesis seen in people consuming a high-protein diet.\n\ue02ehe continual catabolism o\ue037 tissue proteins creates the\nrequirement \ue037or dietary protein, even in an adult who is not\ngrowing; although some o\ue037 the amino acids released can be"

Even so, the need is relatively\nsmall compared with the requirement \ue037or protein turnover.\nIn some countries, protein intake is inadequate to meet these\nrequirements, resulting in stunting o\ue037 growth. \ue02ehere is little\nor no evidence that athletes and body builders require large\namounts o\ue037 protein; simply consuming more o\ue037 a normal diet\nproviding about 14% o\ue037 energy \ue037rom protein will provide more\nthan enough protein \ue037or increased muscle protein synthesis\u2014\nthe main requirement is \ue037or an increased energy intake to per-\nmit increased protein synthesis.\nThere Is a Loss of Body Protein in\nResponse \nto Trauma & Infection\nOne o\ue037 the metabolic reactions to a major trauma, such as\na \nburn, a broken limb, or surgery, is an increase in the net\ncatabolism o\ue037 tissue proteins, both in response to cytokines\nand glucocorticoid hormones, and as a result o\ue037 exces-\nsive utilization o\ue037 threonine and cysteine in the synthesis\no\ue037acute-phase proteins . As much as 6 to 7% o\ue037 the total\nbody protein may be lost over 10 days. Prolonged bed rest\nresults in considerable loss o\ue037 protein because o\ue037 atrophy o\ue037\nmuscles. Protein catabolism may be increased in response to\ncytokines, and without the stimulus o\ue037 exercise it is not com-\npletely replaced. Lost protein is replaced during convales-\ncence , when there is positive nitrogen balance. Again, as in\nthe case o\ue037 athletes, a normal diet is adequate to permit this\nreplacement protein synthesis.\nThe Requirement Is Not Just for\nProtein, \nbut for Specific Amino Acids\nNot all proteins are nutritionally equivalent. More o\ue037 some is\nneeded to main\ntain nitrogen balance than others because di\ue037-\n\ue037erent proteins contain di\ue037\ue037erent amounts o\ue037 the various amino\nacids. \ue02ehe body\u2019s requirement is \ue037or amino acids in the correct\nproportions to replace tissue proteins. \ue02ehe amino acids can\nbe divided into two groups: essential andnonessential . \ue02ehere\nare nine essential or indispensable amino acids, which can-\nnot be synthesized in the body: histidine, isoleucine, leucine,\nlysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and\nvaline. I\ue037 one o\ue037 these is lacking or inadequate, then regardless\no\ue037 the total intake o\ue037 protein, it will not be possible to maintainnitrogen balance since there will not be enough o\ue037 that amino\nacid \ue037or protein synthesis.\n\ue02ewo amino acids, cysteine and tyrosine, can be synthesized\nin the body, but only \ue037rom essential amino acid precursors\u2014\ncysteine \ue037rom methionine and tyrosine \ue037rom phenylalanine.\n\ue02ehe dietary intakes o\ue037 cysteine and tyrosine thus a\ue037\ue037ect the\nrequirements \ue037or methionine and phenylalanine. \ue02ehe remain-\ning 11 amino acids in proteins are considered to be nones-\nsential or dispensable since they can be synthesized as long as\nthere is enough total protein in the diet. I\ue037 one o\ue037 these amino\nacids is omitted \ue037rom the diet, nitrogen balance can still be\nmaintained. However, only three amino acids, alanine, aspar-\ntate, and glutamate, can be considered to be truly dispensable;\nthey are synthesized by transamination o\ue037 common meta-\nbolic intermediates (pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and ketoglutarate,\nrespectively). \ue02ehe remaining amino acids are considered as\nnonessential, but under some circumstances the requirement\nmay outstrip the capacity \ue037or their synthesis.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Digestion involves hydrolyzing \ue037ood molecules into smaller\nmolecules \ue037o\nr absorption through the gastrointestinal\nepithelium. Polysaccharides are absorbed as monosaccharides,\ntriacylglycerols as 2-monoacylglycerols, \ue037atty acids and\nglycerol, and proteins as amino acids and small peptides.\n\u25a0Digestive disorders arise as a result o\ue037 (1) enzyme de\ue003ciency,\n\ue037or \nexample, lactase and sucrase; (2) malabsorption, \ue037or\nexample, o\ue037 glucose and galactose as a result o\ue037 de\ue037ects in\nthe Na+-glucose cotransporter (SGL\ue02e 1); (3) absorption o\ue037\nunhydr\nolyzed polypeptides leading to immune responses,\n\ue037or example, as in celiac disease; and (4) precipitation o\ue037\ncholesterol \ue037rom bile as gallstones.\n\u25a0In addition to water, the diet must provide metabolic \ue037uels\n(carbohy\ndrate and \ue037at) \ue037or body growth and activity, protein\n\ue037or synthesis o\ue037 tissue proteins, \ue003ber \ue037or bulk in the intestinal\ncontents, minerals \ue037or speci\ue003c metabolic \ue037unctions (see\nChapter 44), polyunsaturated \ue037atty acids o\ue037 the n\u22123 and n\u22126\n\ue037amilies, and vitamins\u2014organic compounds needed in small\namounts \ue037or other essential \ue037unctions (see Chapter 44).\n\u25a0Undernutrition occurs in two extreme \ue037orms: marasmus, in\nadults \nand children, and kwashiorkor in children. Chronic\nillness can also lead to undernutrition (cachexia) as a result o\ue037\nhypermetabolism.\n\u25a0Overnutrition leads to excess energy intake and is associated\nwith c\nhronic noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, type 2\ndiabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and hypertension.\n\u25a0\ue02ewenty diferent amino acids are required \ue037or protein synthesis,\no\ue037 \nwhich nine are essential in the human diet. Te quantity\no\ue037 protein required can be determined by studies o\ue037 nitrogen\nbalance and is afected by protein quality\u2014the amounts o\ue037\nessential amino acids present in dietary proteins compared\nwith the amounts required \ue037or tissue protein synthesis."

Many\npeople take supplements o\ue031 one or more antioxidant nutrients.\nHowever, intervention trials show little bene\ue031it o\ue031 antioxidant\nsupplements except among people who were initially de\ue031i-\ncient, and many trials o\ue031 \u03b2-carotene and vitamin E have shown\nincreased mortality among those taking the supplements.\nFree Radical Reactions Are Self-\nPerpetua\nting Chain Reactions\nFree radicals are highly reactive molecular species with an\nunpair\ned electron; they persist \ue031or only a very short time (o\ue031\nthe order o\ue031 10\u22129to 10\u221212seconds) be\ue031ore they collide with\nanother molecule and either abstract or donate an electron\nin order to achieve stability. In so doing, they generate a new\nradical \ue031rom the molecule with which they collided. \ue028he main\nway in which a \ue031ree radical can be quenched, so terminating\nthis chain reaction, is i\ue031 two radicals react together, when\nthe unpaired electrons can become paired in one or other\no\ue031 the parent molecules. \ue028his is a rare occurrence, because\no\ue031 the very short hal\ue031-li\ue031e o\ue031 an individual radical and the very\nlow concentrations o\ue031 radicals in tissues.\ue028he most damaging radicals in biological systems are\noxygen radicals (sometimes called reactive oxygen species)\u2014\nespecially superoxide,\u2022O2\u2212, hydroxyl,\u2022OH, and perhydroxyl,\n\u2022O2H. \ue028issue damage caused by oxygen radicals is o\ue031ten called\noxida\ntive damage, and \ue031actors that protect against oxygen rad-\nical damage are known as antioxidants.\nRadicals Can Damage DNA,\nLipids, \n& Proteins\nInteraction o\ue031 radicals with bases in DNA can lead to chemical\nchang\nes that, i\ue031 not repaired (see Chapter 35), may be inherited\nin daughter cells. Radical damage to unsaturated \ue031atty acids in\ncell membranes and plasma lipoproteins leads to the \ue031orma-\ntion o\ue031 lipid peroxides, precursors o\ue031 highly reactive dialde-\nhydes that can chemically modi\ue031y proteins and nucleic acid\nbases. Proteins are also subject to direct chemical modi\ue031ica-\ntion by interaction with radicals. Oxidative damage to tyrosine\nresidues in proteins can lead to the \ue031ormation o\ue031 dihydroxy-\nphenylalanine that can undergo nonenzymic reactions leading\nto \ue031urther \ue031ormation o\ue031 oxygen radicals ( Figure 45\u20131 ).\n\ue028he total body radical burden can be estimated by mea-\nsuring the products o\ue031 lipid peroxidation.

Proteoglycans contain a galactose-galactose-xylose tri-\nsaccharide (the so-called link trisaccharide) attached to\nserine.\n3. Collagens (see Chapter 50) contain a galactose-hydroxy-\nlysine linkage.\n4.Many nuclear and cytosolic proteins contain side chains\nconsisting o\ue038 a single N-acetylglucosamine attached to a\nserine or threonine residue.\nMucins Have a High Content of\nO-Linked \nOligosaccharides & Exhibit\nRepeating Amino Acid Sequences\nMucins are glycoproteins that are highly resistant to prote-\nolysis \nbecause the density o\ue038 oligosaccharide chains makes it\ndi\ue038\ue038icult \ue038or proteases to access the polypeptide chain. \ue02bhey\nhelp to lubricate and \ue038orm a protective physical barrier on\nepithelial sur\ue038aces.\nMucins have two distinctive characteristics: a high con-\ntent o\ue038 O-linked oligosaccharides (the carbohydrate content\nis generally more than 50%); and the presence o\ue038 variable\nnumbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) o\ue038 peptide sequencein the center o\ue038 the polypeptide chain, to which the O-glycan\nchains are attached in clusters. \ue02bhese tandem repeat sequences\nare rich in serine, threonine, and proline; indeed, up to 60%\no\ue038 the dietary requirement \ue038or threonine can be accounted \ue038or\nby the synthesis o\ue038 mucins. Although O-glycans predominate,\nmucins o\ue038ten also contain a number o\ue038 N-glycan chains.\nBoth secretory and membrane-bound mucins occur.\nMucus secreted by the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and\nreproductive tracts is a solution containing about 5%\nmucins. Secretory mucins generally have an oligomeric\nstructure, with monomers linked by disul\ue038ide bonds, and\nhence a very high molecular mass. Mucus has a high viscos-\nity and o\ue038ten \ue038orms a gel because o\ue038 its content o\ue038 mucins.\n\ue02bhe high content o\ue038 O-glycans con\ue038ers an extended struc-\nture. \ue02bhis is partly explained by steric interactions between\ntheN-acetylgalactosamine moieties and adjacent amino\nacids, resulting in a chain-sti\ue038\ue038ening e\ue038\ue038ect, so that the con-\n\ue038ormation o\ue038 mucins o\ue038ten become rigid rods. Intermolecu-\nlar noncovalent interactions between sugars on neighboring\nglycan chains contribute to gel \ue038ormation. \ue02bhe high content\no\ue038N-acetylneuraminic acid andsulfate residues \ue038ound in\nmany mucins gives them a negative charge.\nMembrane-bound mucins participate in cell\u2013cell inter-\nactions . \ue02bhey may also mask cell sur\ue038ace antigens. Many\ncancer cells \ue038orm large amounts o\ue038 mucins that mask sur\ue038ace\nantigens and protect the cancer cells \ue038rom immune surveil-\nlance.

Some o\ue038 these have been used to stimulate an\nimmune response against cancer cells.\nO-Linked Glycoproteins Are\nSynthesized by Sequential Addition of\nSugars from Sugar Nucleotides\nBecause most glycoproteins are membrane-bound or secreted,\ntheir \nmRNA is usually translated on membrane-bound poly-\nribosomes (see Chapter 37). \ue02bhe glycan chains are built up\nby the sequential donation o\ue038 sugars \ue038rom sugar nucleotides,\ncatalyzed by glycoprotein glycosyltransferases . Because\nmany glycosylation reactions occur within the lumen o\ue038 the\nGolgi apparatus, there are carrier systems (permeases and\ntransporters) to transport sugar nucleotides (UDP-galactose,\nGDP-mannose, and CMP- N-acetylneuraminic acid) across\nthe Golgi membrane. \ue02bhese are antiporter systems in which\nthe in\ue038lux o\ue038 one molecule o\ue038 sugar nucleotide is balanced by the\ne\ue038\ue038lux o\ue038 one molecule o\ue038 the corresponding nucleotide (UMP ,\nGMP , or CMP).\nHumans possess 41 di\ue038\ue038erent types o\ue038 glycoprotein glyco-\nsyltrans\ue038erases.

Controlling\n\ue038actors in the \ue038irst stage o\ue038 N-linked glycoprotein biosynthe-\nsis (assembly and trans\ue038er o\ue038 the dolichol pyrophosphate oli-\ngosaccharide) include not only the availability o\ue038 the sugar\nnucleotides, but also the presence o\ue038 suitable acceptor sites in\nproteins, the tissue concentration o\ue038 dolichol phosphate, and\nthe activity o\ue038 the relevant oligosaccharide: protein trans\ue038erase.\nVarious cancer cells are \ue038ound to synthesize di\ue038\ue038erent\noligosaccharide chains \ue038rom those made in normal cells (eg,\ngreater branching). \ue02bhis is due to cancer cells expressing di\ue038-\n\ue038erent patterns o\ue038 glycosyltrans\ue038erases \ue038rom those in normal\ncells, as a result o\ue038 speci\ue038ic gene activation or repression. \ue02bhe\ndi\ue038\ue038erences in oligosaccharide chains could a\ue038\ue038ect adhesive\ninteractions between cancer cells and the normal parent tissue\ncells, contributing to metastasis.\nSOME PROTEINS ARE ANCHORED\nT\nO THE PLASMA MEMBRANE BY\nGLYCOPHOSPHATIDYL-INOSITOL\nSTRUCTURES\nMembrane-bound proteins that are anchored to the lipid\nbilay\ner by a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail (Figure 46\u20131)\nconstitute the third major class o\ue038 glycoproteins. \ue02bhe GPI link-\nage is the most common way by which various proteins are\nanchored to cell membranes.\n\ue02bhe proteins are anchored to the outer lea\ue038let o\ue038 the plasma\nmembrane or the inner (luminal) lea\ue038let o\ue038 the membrane in\nsecretory vesicles by the \ue038atty acids o\ue038 phosphatidylinositol.\n\ue02bhe phosphatidylinositol is linked via N-acetylglucosamine to\na glycan chain containing a variety o\ue038 sugars, including man-\nnose and glucosamine. In turn, the oligosaccharide chain is\nlinked via phosphorylethanolamine in an amide linkage to the\ncarboxyl-terminal amino acid o\ue038 the protein. Additional con-\nstituents are \ue038ound in many GPI structures; \ue038or example, that\nshown in Figure 46\u20131 contains an extra phosphorylethanol-\namine attached to the middle o\ue038 the three mannose moieties\no\ue038 the glycan and an extra \ue038atty acid attached to glucosamine.\ue02bhere are three \ue038unctions o\ue038 this GPI linkage:\n1.\ue02bhe GPI anchor allows greatly enhanced mobility o\ue038 a\nprotein in the plasma membrane compared with that o\ue038\na protein that employ transmembrane domains. \ue02bhe GPI\nanchor is attached only to the outer lea\ue038let o\ue038 the lipid\nbilayer, so that it is \ue038reer to di\ue038\ue038use than a protein anchored\nthrough both layers o\ue038 the membrane. Enhanced mobility\nmay be important in \ue038acilitating rapid responses to stimuli.\n2.Some GPI anchors may connect with signal transduction\npathways, enabling proteins that lack a transmembrane\ndomain to nevertheless serve as receptors \ue038or hormones\nand other cell sur\ue038ace signals.\n3.GPI structures can target proteins to apical or basolateral\ndomains o\ue038 the plasma membrane o\ue038 polarized epithelial\ncells.\n\ue02bhe GPI anchor is pre\ue038ormed in the endoplasmic reticulum,\nand is then attached to the protein a\ue038ter ribosomal synthesis is\ncomplete. \ue02bhe primary translation products o\ue038 GPI-anchored\nproteins have not only an amino-terminal signal sequence that\ndirects them into the endoplasmic reticulum during synthesis,\nbut also a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain that acts as\nthe signal \ue038or attachment o\ue038 the GPI anchor. \ue02bhe \ue038irst stage in\nsynthesis o\ue038 the GPI anchor is insertion o\ue038 the \ue038atty acids o\ue038\nphosphatidylinositol into the luminal \ue038ace o\ue038 the endoplasmic\nreticulum membrane, \ue038ollowed by glycosylation, starting with\nesteri\ue038ication o\ue038 N-acetyl-glucosamine to the phosphate group\no\ue038 phosphatidylinositol. A terminal phosphoethanolamine\nmoiety is added to the completed glycan chain. \ue02bhe hydropho-\nbic carboxy-terminal domain o\ue038 the protein is displaced by the\namino group o\ue038 ethanolamine in the transamidation reaction\nthat \ue038orms the amide linkage between the GPI anchor and an\naspartate residue in the protein.\nSOME PROTEINS UNDERGO\nRAPIDL\nY REVERSIBLE\nGLYCOSYLATION\nMany proteins, including nuclear pore proteins, proteins\no\ue038 \nthe cytoskeleton, transcription \ue038actors, and proteins\nassociated with chromatin, as well as nuclear oncogene\nproteins and tumor suppressor proteins, undergo rap-\nidly reversible O-glycosylation with a single sugar moiety,\nN-acetylglucosamine. \ue02bhe serine and threonine sites o\ue038 gly-\ncosylation are the same as those o\ue038 phosphorylation o\ue038 these\nproteins, and glycosylation and phosphorylation occur recip-\nrocally in response to cellular signaling.\n\ue02bheO-linked N-acetylglucosamine trans\ue038erase that catalyzes\nthis glycosylation uses UDP- N-acetylglucosamine as the sugar\ndonor, and has phosphatase activity, so can directly replace a ser-\nine or threonine phosphate with N-acetylglucosamine. \ue02bhere is\nno absolute consensus sequence \ue038or the enzyme, but about hal\ue038\nthe sites that are subject to reciprocal glycosylation and phos-\nphorylation are Pro-Val-Ser. \ue02bhis O-linked N-acetylglucosamine\ntrans\ue038erase is activated by phosphorylation in response"

Initially, glucose \ue038orms a Schiff base to\nthe amino terminal o\ue038 the protein, which then undergoes the\nAmadori rearrangement to yield ketoamines (Figure 46\u20135 ),\nand \ue038urther reactions to yield advanced glycation end-prod-\nucts (AGEs) . \ue02bhe overall series o\ue038 reactions is known as the\nMaillard reaction , which is involved in the browning o\ue038 cer-\ntain \ue038oodstu\ue038\ue038s during storage or heating, and provides much\no\ue038 the \ue038lavor o\ue038 some \ue038oods.\nAdvanced glycation end-products induce tissue damage\nin poorly controlled diabetes mellitus . When the blood glu-\ncose concentration is consistently elevated, there is increased\nglycation o\ue038 proteins. Glycation o\ue038 collagen and other proteins\nin the extracellular matrix alters their properties (eg, increas-\ning the cross-linking of collagen ). Cross-linking can lead toaccumulation o\ue038 various plasma proteins in the walls o\ue038 blood\nvessels; in particular, accumulation o\ue038 low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL) can contribute to atherogenesis . AGEs appear to be\ninvolved in both microvascular andmacrovascular damage\nin diabetes mellitus. Endothelial cells and macrophages have\nAGE receptors on their sur\ue038aces; uptake o\ue038 glycated proteins\nby these receptors can activate the transcription \ue038actor NF-kB\n(see Chapter 52), generating a variety o\ue038 cytokines andproin-\nflammatory molecules .\nNonenzymic glycation o\ue038 hemoglobin A present in red\nblood cells leads to the \ue038ormation o\ue038 HbA1c.

A\nprotein on the sperm sur\ue038ace interacts with the oligosaccha-\nride chains o\ue038 ZP3. By transmembrane signaling, this interac-\ntion induces the acrosomal reaction , in which enzymes such\nas proteases and hyaluronidase along with other contents o\ue038\nthe acrosome o\ue038 the sperm are released. Liberation o\ue038 these\nenzymes permits the sperm to pass through the zona pellucida\nand reach the plasma membrane o\ue038 the oocyte.

Mannose-\nbinding protein , a lectin synthesized by liver cells and secreted\ninto the circulation, binds mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and\nsome other sugars. It can thus bind agalactosyl IgG molecules,\nwhich subsequently activate the complement system, contrib-\nuting to chronic in\ue038lammation in the synovial membranes o\ue038\njoints.\nMannose-binding protein can also bind sugars when\nthey are present on the sur\ue038aces o\ue038 bacteria, \ue038ungi, and\nviruses, preparing these pathogens \ue038or opsonization or \ue038or\ndestruction by the complement system. \ue02bhis is an example o\ue038\ninnate immunity , which does not involve immunoglobulins\nor \ue02b lymphocytes.

Reactions involving hydrolysis (eg, catalyzed by\nesterases) and other, non-P450\u2013catalyzed, reactions also occur\nin phase 1.\nPhase 1 metabolism renders compounds more reactive\nby introducing groups that can be conjugated with gluc-\nuronic acid, sul\ue036ate, acetate, glutathione, or amino acids\nin phase 2 metabolism. \ue02ahis produces polar compounds\nthat are water-soluble and can there\ue036ore be excreted in\nurine or bile.\nIn some cases, phase 1 metabolic reactions convert xeno-\nbiotics \ue036rom inactive tobiologically active compounds.

Sometimes, additional phase 1\nreactions (eg, \ue036urther hydroxylation reactions) convert these\nactive compounds into less active or inactive \ue036orms prior to\nconjugation. In other cases, it is the conjugation reactions that\nconvert the active products o\ue036 phase 1 reactions to inactive\ncompounds, which are excreted.\u25a0Describe the two phases o\ue01c xenobiotic metabolism, the \ue001rst involving mainly\nhydroxy\nlation reactions catalyzed by cytochromes P450 and the second\nconjugation reactions.\n\u25a0Describe the metabolic importance o\ue01c glutathione.\n\u25a0Describe how xenobiotics can have toxic, immunological, and carcinogenic\nefec\nts.O B J E C T I V E S\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou \nshould be able to:\nBIOMEDICAL IMPORTANCE\nWe are exposed to a wide variety o\ue036 compunds that are \ue036oreign\nto \nthe body (xenobiotics , \ue036rom the Greek xenos = \ue036oreign);\nnaturally occurring compounds in plant \ue036oods, and synthetic\ncompounds in medicines, \ue036ood additives, and environmental\npollutants.

Cyto-\nchrome P450 is a heme enzyme. It is so named because it was\noriginally discovered when it was noted that preparations o\ue036\nmicrosomes (\ue036ragments o\ue036 the endoplasmic reticulum) that\nhad been chemically reduced and then exposed to carbon\nmonoxide had an absorption peak at 450 nm.\nAt least hal\ue036 o\ue036 the common drugs that we ingest are\nmetabolized by iso\ue036orms o\ue036 cytochrome P450. \ue02ahey also act\non steroid hormones, carcinogens, and pollutants. In addition,\ncytochromes P450 are important in the metabolism o\ue036 a num-\nber o\ue036 physiological compounds\u2014\ue036or example, the synthesis\no\ue036 steroid hormones (see Chapter 26) and the conversion o\ue036\nvitamin D to its active metabolite, calcitriol (see Chapter 44).\n\ue02ahe overall reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 is:\nRH + O2+ N ADPH + H+\u2192R -OH + H2O + NADP\n\ue02ahe \nreaction mechanism is shown in Figure 12\u20136.\nNADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase catalyzes the trans\ue036er\no\ue036 electrons \ue036rom NADPH to cytochrome P450. Reduced cyto-\nchrome P450 catalyzes the reductive activation of molecular\noxygen , one atom o\ue036 which becomes the hydroxyl group in the\nsubstrate and the other is reduced to water. Cytochrome b5,\nanother hemo\nprotein \ue036ound in the membranes o\ue036 the smooth\nendoplasmic reticulum (see Chapter 12), may be involved as\nan electron donor in some cases.\nIsoforms of Cytochrome P450 Form\na \nSuperfamily of Heme-Containing\nEnzymes\n\ue02ahere is a systema tic nomenclature \ue036or the cytochromes\nP450 and their genes, based on their amino acid sequence\nhomology. \ue02ahe root CYP denotes a cytochrome P450. \ue02ahis\nis \ue036ollowed by number designating the family ; cytochromes\nP450 are included in the same \ue036amily i\ue036 they exhibit 40% or\nmore amino acid sequence identity. \ue02ahis is \ue036ollowed by a\ncapital letter indicating the subfamily ; P450s are in the same\nsub\ue036amily i\ue036 they exhibit more than 55% sequence identity.\n\ue02aheindividual P450s are then assigned numbers in their sub-\n\ue036amily. \ue02ahus, CYP1A1 denotes a cytochrome P450 that is a\nmember o\ue036 \ue036amily 1 and sub\ue036amily A and is the \ue036irst individual\nmember o\ue036 that sub\ue036amily. \ue02ahe nomenclature \ue036or the genes\nencoding cytochromes P450 is the same, except that italics are\nused; thus, the gene encoding CYP1A1 is CYP1A1.\n\ue02ahe major \ue036amilies o\ue036 cytochromes P450 involved in\ndrug metabolism are CYP1 (with 3 sub\ue036amilies), CYP2(13 sub\ue036amilies), and CYP3 (1 sub\ue036amily). \ue02ahe various cyto-\nchromes P450 have overlapping substrate speci\ue036icities, so that\na very broad range o\ue036 xenobiotics can be metabolized by one\nor other o\ue036 the enzymes.\nCytochromes P450 are present in greatest amount in liver\ncells and enterocytes. In liver and most other tissues, they\nare present mainly in the membranes of the smooth endo-\nplasmic reticulum , which constitute part o\ue036 the microsomal\nfraction when tissue is subjected to subcellular \ue036ractionation.\nIn hepatic microsomes, cytochromes P450 can comprise as\nmuch as 20% o\ue036 the total protein. In the adrenal gland , where\nthey are involved in cholesterol and steroid hormone biosyn-\nthesis, they are \ue036ound in mitochondria as well as in the endo-\nplasmic reticulum (see Chapters 26 and 41).\nOverlapping Specificity of\nC\nytochromes P450 Explains\nInteractions Between Drugs and\nBetween Drugs and Nutrients\nMost iso\ue036orms o\ue036 cytochrome P450 are inducible . For\ninstance, the administration o\ue036 phenobarbital or other drugs\ncauses hypertrophy o\ue036 the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and\na three- to \ue036our\ue036old increase in the amount o\ue036 cytochrome\nP450 within a \ue036ew days. In most cases this involves increased\ntranscription to mRNA. However, in some cases, induction\ninvolves stabilization o\ue036 mRNA or the enzyme protein itsel\ue036,\nor increased translation o\ue036 existing mRNA.\nInduction o\ue036 cytochrome P450 underlies drug interac-\ntions , when the e\ue036\ue036ects o\ue036 one drug are altered by adminis-\ntration o\ue036 another. For example, the anticoagulant warfarin is\nmetabolized by CYP2C9 , which is induced by phenobarbital.\nInduction o\ue036 CYP2C9 will increase the metabolism o\ue036 war\ue036a-\nrin, so reducing its e\ue036\ue036icacy, so that the dose must be increased.\nCYP2E1 catabolizes the metabolism o\ue036 some widely used sol-\nvents and compounds \ue036ound in tobacco smoke, many o\ue036 which\nareprocarcinogens ; it is induced by ethanol , so increasing the\nrisk o\ue036 carcinogenicity.\nNaturally occurring compounds in \ue036oods may also a\ue036\ue036ect\ncytochrome P450. Grape\ue036ruit contains a variety o\ue036 \ue036urano-\ncoumarins, which inhibit cytochrome P450 and so a\ue036\ue036ect the\nmetabolism o\ue036 many drugs. Some drugs are activated by cyto-\nchrome P450, so that grape\ue036ruit will reduce their activity; others\nare inactivated by cytochrome P450, so that grape\ue036ruit increases\ntheir activity. Drugs that are a\ue036\ue036ected include statins, omepra-\nzole, antihistamines, and benzodiazepine antidepressants.\nPolymorphism o\ue036 cytochromes P450 may explain much\no\ue036 the variation in drug responses by di\ue036\ue036erent patients; vari-\nants with low catalytic activity will lead to slower metabolism\no\ue036 the substrate, and hence prolonged drug action. CYP2A6\nis involved in the metabolism o\ue036 nicotine to conitine. \ue02ahree\nCYP2A6 alleles have been identi\ue036ied: a wild type and two inac-\ntive alleles. Individuals with the null alleles, who have impaired\nmetabolism o\ue036 nicotine, are apparently protected against\nbecoming tobacco-dependent smokers. \ue02ahese individuals"

In phase 2 reactions, these derivatives\nare conjugated with molecules such as glucuronic acid, sul\ue036ate,\nor glutathione. \ue02ahis renders them even more water-soluble,\n\ue036acilitating their eventual excretion in the urine or bile.\nGlucuronidation Is the Most Frequent\nConjugation \nReaction\n\ue02ahe glucu ronidation o\ue036 bilirubin is discussed in Chapter 31;\nxenobiotics are glucuronidated in the same way, using UDP-\nglucuronic acid (see Figure 20\u20134) along with a variety o\ue036 gluc-\nuronosyltrans\ue036erases, present in both the endoplasmic reticulum\nand cytosol. Molecules such as 2-acetylamino\ue036luorene (a carcin-\nogen), aniline, benzoic acid, meprobamate (a tranquilizer), phe-\nnol, and many steroid hormones are excreted as glucuronides.\n\ue02ahe glucuronide may be attached to oxygen, nitrogen, or sul\ue036ur\ngroups o\ue036 the substrates.\nSome Alcohols, Arylamines, and\nPhenols \nAre Sulfated\n\ue02ahe sulfate donor in these and other biologic and sul\ue036ation\nreactions (eg, sul\ue036ation o\ue036 steroids, glycosaminoglycans, gly-\ncolipids, and glycoproteins) is \u201cactive sul\ue036ate\u201d\u2014adenosine\n3\u2032-phosphate-5\u2032 -phosphosulfate (PAPS; see Chapter 24).\nGlutathione Is Required for\nConjugation \nof Electrophilic\nCompounds\n\ue02ahe tripeptide glutathione (\u03b3-glutamylcysteinylglycine) is\nimportan\nt in the phase II metabolism o\ue036 electrophilic com-\npounds, \ue036orming glutathione S-conjugates that are excreted\nin urine and bile. \ue02ahe reaction catalyzed by glutathione\nS-trans\ue036erases is:\nR + GSH \u2192R\u2212S\u2212G\nwhere R is an electrophilic compound.\n\ue02ahere are \ue036our classes o\ue036 cytosolic glutathione S-trans\ue036erase\nand two classes o\ue036 membrane-bound microsomal enzymes, as\nwell as a structurally distinct kappa class that is \ue036ound in mito-\nchondria and peroxisomes. Glutathione S-trans\ue036erases exist as\nhomo- or heterodimers constructed \ue036rom at least seven di\ue036-\n\ue036erent types o\ue036 subunit, and di\ue036\ue036erent subunits are induced by\ndi\ue036\ue036erent xenobiotics.Because glutathione S-trans\ue036erases also bind a number\no\ue036 ligands that are not substrates, including bilirubin, ste-\nroid hormones, and some carcinogens and their metabo-\nlites, they are sometimes known as ligandin . Glutathione\nS-trans\ue036erase binds bilirubin at a site distinct \ue036rom the cata-\nlytic site. \ue02ahe complex transits \ue036rom the bloodstream to the\nliver, then to the endoplasmic reticulum \ue036or conjugation\no\ue036 bilirubin with glucuronic acid, and excretion in the bile\n(see Chapter 31). Binding o\ue036 carcinogens sequesters them,\nso preventing their actions on DNA.\n\ue02ahe liver exhibits a very high level o\ue036 glutathione\nS-trans\ue036erase activity; in vitro the entire pool o\ue036 glutathione\ncan be depleted within minutes on exposure to a xenobiotic\nsubstrate. \ue02ahe activity o\ue036 glutathione S-trans\ue036erase is upregu-\nlated in many tumors, leading to resistance to chemotherapy.\nGlutathione conjugates may be transported out o\ue036 the\nliver, where they are substrates \ue036or extracellular \u03b3-glutamyl-\ntranspeptidase and some dipeptidases. \ue02ahe resultant cysteine\nS-conjugates are taken up by other tissues (especially the kidney)\nandN-acetylated to yield mercapturic acids ( N-acetyl cysteine\nS-conjugates), which are excreted in the urine. Some hepatic\nglutathione S-conjugates enter the bile canniculi, where they are\nbroken down to cysteine S-conjugates that are then taken up into\nthe liver \ue036or N-acetylation, and re-excreted in the bile.\nIn addition to its role in phase 2 metabolism, glutathione\nhas a number o\ue036 other roles in metabolism:\n1.It provides the reductant \ue036or the reduction o\ue036 hydrogen\nperoxide to water in the reaction catalyzed by glutathione\nperoxidase (see Figure 20\u20133).\n2.It is an important intracellular reductant and antioxidant ,\nhelping to maintain essential SH groups o\ue036 enzymes in\ntheir reduced state.\n3.A metabolic cycle involving GSH as a carrier has been\nimplicated in the transport of some amino acids across\nmembranes in the kidney. \ue02ahe \ue036irst reaction o\ue036 the cycle is\ncatalyzed by \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) :\nAmino acid + GSH \u2192\u03b3-Glutamyl amino acid\n+ Cysteinylglycine\n\ue02ahis reaction trans\ue036ers amino acids across the plasma\nmembrane as dipeptides, which are subsequently hydrolyzed,\nreleasing the amino acid and glutamate and the GSH being\nresynthesized \ue036rom cysteinylglycine. GG\ue02a is present in the\nplasma membrane o\ue036 renal tubular cells and bile ductule cells,\nand in the endoplasmic reticulum o\ue036 hepatocytes. It is released\ninto the blood \ue036rom hepatic cells in various hepatobiliary dis-\neases, providing an early indication o\ue036 liver damage.\nOTHER REACTIONS ARE\nALSO \nINVOLVED IN PHASE 2\nMETABOLISM\n\ue02ahe two most important reactions other than conjugation are\nacetylation \nand methylation."

As \ue036or\nother acetylation reactions, acetyl-CoA is the acetyl donor.\n\ue02ahese reactions are catalyzed by acetyltransferases present\nin the cytosol o\ue036 various tissues, particularly liver. \ue02ahe drug\nisoniazid , used in the treatment o\ue036 tuberculosis, is subject\nto acetylation. \ue02ahere is polymorphism o\ue036 acetyltrans\ue036erases,\nresulting in individuals who are classi\ue036ied as slow or fast\nacetylators . Slow acetylators are more subject to the toxic\ne\ue036\ue036ects o\ue036 isoniazid because the drug persists \ue036or longer.\nSome xenobiotics are subject to methylation by methyltrans-\n\ue036erases, employing S-adenosylmethionine (see Figure 29\u201317) as\nthe methyl donor.\nRESPONSES TO\nXENOBIOTICS\n INCLUDE\nTOXIC, IMMUNOLOGICAL, &\nCARCINOGENIC EFFECTS\n\ue02ahere are very \ue036ew xenobiotics, including drugs, that do not\nhav\ne some toxic e\ue036\ue036ects i\ue036 the dose is large enough. \ue02ahe toxic\neffects of xenobiotics cover a wide spectrum, but can be con-\nsidered under three general headings:\n1.Covalent binding o\ue036 xenobiotic metabolites to macro-\nmolecules including DNA ,RNA , and protein can lead to\ncell injury (cytotoxicity) , which can be severe enough to\nresult in cell death. In response to damage to DNA, the\nDNA repair mechanism o\ue036 the cell is activated. Part o\ue036 this\ninvolves the trans\ue036er o\ue036 multiple ADP-ribose units onto\nDNA-binding proteins, catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose\npolymerase). \ue02ahe source o\ue036 ADP-ribose is NAD, and in\nresponse to severe DNA damage there is considerable\ndepletion o\ue036 NAD. In turn, this leads to severely impaired\nA\ue02aP \ue036ormation, and cell death.\n2.\ue02ahe reactive metabolite o\ue036 a xenobiotic may bind to a pro-\ntein, acting as a hapten, and altering its antigenicity . On its\nown it will not stimulate antibody production, but does so\nwhen bound to a protein. \ue02ahe resultant antibodies react not\nonly with the modi\ue036ied protein but also with the unmodi-\n\ue036ied protein, so potentially initiating autoimmune disease .\n3.Reactions o\ue036 some activated xenobiotics with DNA are\nimportant in chemical carcinogenesis . Some chemicals (eg,\nbenzo[\u03b1]pyrene) require activation by cytochrome P450 in\nthe endoplasmic reticulum to become carcinogenic (they\nare there\ue036ore called indirect carcinogens ). \ue02ahe activities o\ue036\nthe xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes present in the endo-\nplasmic reticulum thus help to determine whether such\ncompounds become carcinogenic or are \u201cdetoxi\ue036ied. \u201d\ue02ahe enzyme epoxide hydrolase , located in the mem-\nbranes o\ue036 the endoplasmic reticulum, can protect against some\ncarcinogens. \ue02ahe products o\ue036 the action o\ue036 cytochrome P450\non some procarcinogen substrates are epoxides . Epoxides\nare highly reactive and, hence, potentially mutagenic or car-\ncinogenic. As shown in Figure 47\u20131 , the hydrolase catalyzes\nhydrolysis o\ue036 epoxides to much less reactive dihydrodiols.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Xenobiotics are chemical compounds \ue036oreign to the\nbo\ndy, including drugs, \ue036ood additives, and environmental\npollutants, as well as naturally occurring compounds in\nplant \ue036oods.\n\u25a0Xenobiotics are metabolized in two phases. Te major\nreaction \no\ue036 phase 1 is hydroxylation catalyzed by a variety\no\ue036 monooxygenases, known as the cytochromes P450. In\nphase 2, the hydroxylated species are conjugated with a variety\no\ue036 hydrophilic compounds such as glucuronic acid, sul\ue036ate,\nor glutathione. Te combined operation o\ue036 these two phases\nconverts lipophilic compounds into water-soluble compounds\nthat can be excreted in urine or bile.\n\u25a0Cytochromes P450 catalyze reactions that introduce one atom\no\ue036 \noxygen derived \ue036rom molecular oxygen into the substrate,\nyielding a hydroxylated product, and the other into water.\nNADPH and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase are involved\nin the reaction mechanism.\n\u25a0Cytochromes P450 are hemoproteins and generally have a\nwide su\nbstrate speci\ue001city, acting on many exogenous and\nendogenous substrates. At least 57 cytochrome P450 genes are\n\ue036ound in the human genome.\n\u25a0Cytochromes P450 are generally located in the endoplasmic\nreticulum \no\ue036 cells, especially in the liver.\n\u25a0Many cytochromes P450 are inducible. Tis has important\nimplica\ntions \ue036or interactions between drugs.\n\u25a0Phase 2 conjugation reactions are catalyzed by enzymes such\nas gl\nucuronyltrans\ue036erases, sul\ue036otrans\ue036erases, and glutathione\nS-trans\ue036erases, using UDP-glucuronic acid, PAPS (active\nsul\ue036ate), and glutathione, respectively, as donors.\n\u25a0Glutathione not only plays an important role in phase 2\nreactions, \nbut also is an intracellular reducing agent.\n\u25a0Xenobiotics can produce a variety o\ue036 biological efects,\nincluding\n toxicity, immunological reactions, and cancer.C C\nO+ H2O C C\nOH\n OHEpoxide hydrolase\nEpoxide Dihydrodiol\nFIGURE 47\u20131 The reaction of epoxide hydrolase."

The assay consists of incubating two samples\nof the red cell lysate: one that has been preincubated with,\nand one without, addition of the coenzyme. Then substrate is\nadded to both, and the activity of the enzyme is measured. In\nthe sample preincubated without addition of the coenzyme,\nonly that enzyme that had coenzyme bound (the holoenzyme)\nwill be active. In the sample that was preincubated with the\ncoenzyme, any apoenzyme (inactive enzyme protein without\nbound coenzyme) will have been activated to the holoenzyme.\nThere is, therefore, always either no change in enzyme activ-\nity on addition of coenzyme, indicating complete saturation of\nthe enzyme with coenzyme, or an increase in activity, reflect-\ning the activation of the apoenzyme by added coenzyme. The\nresults are reported as an enzyme activation coefficient (the\nratio of activity in the sample preincubated with coenzyme:\nthat without). Reference ranges for the activation coefficient\nare established in the same way as for any other test. Such\nenzyme activation assays are available for thiamin (vitamin B1,\nusing red cell transk\netolase), riboflavin (vitamin B2, using red\ncell \nglutathione reductase), and vitamin B6(using one or the\nother of the red cell transaminases).\nCompetitive Ligand-Binding Assays\nand \nImmunoassays\nIf there is a protein that will bind the analyte, and the bound\nand \nfree analyte (ligand) can be separated and measured, then\nit is possible to devise an assay for the analyte. Perhaps the\nsimplest such ligand-binding assay is that for the hormone\ncortisol, which is transported in the bloodstream bound to a\nspecific cortisol-binding globulin. It is easy to prepare a plasma\nsample containing the binding globulin that has been stripped\nof its ligand (cortisol) by incubation with aluminum oxide or\ncharcoal. This is done using a relatively large pooled plasma\nsample, and provides binding globulin for a large number of\nassays. The hormone is extracted from each sample to be ana-\nlyzed, using an organic solvent, evaporated to dryness, then\ndissolved in ethanol and a suitable buffer, with the addition\nof a trace amount of highly radioactive hormone. Each sam-\nple is then incubated with the binding globulin at 37\u00b0C, then\ncooled to 4\u00b0C. Charcoal is added to adsorb the unbound ligand,\nand rapidly removed by centrifugation. The radioactivity in\nthe supernatant is measured. This gives a measure of bound\nligand, and is expressed as a percentage of the total radioac-\ntivity added to each sample. A standard curve is constructed\nusing known amounts of hormone, so that the concentration\nof hormone in the samples can be determined.\nA wide variety of additional hormones and other analytes\ncan be measured in the same way, by raising either monoclo-\nnal antibodies or polyclonal antisera against the analyte, for\nexample, by injecting the analyte covalently bound to a protein\ninto an animal. The antiserum against a hormone raised in a\nsingle rabbit can be used for many thousands of assays. Each\nbatch of antiserum must, of course, be tested for its specificityfor the hormone (ensuring that it does not also bind related\nhormones, especially a problem with steroid hormones), and\nfor its sensitivity. When the binding protein is an antibody or\nantiserum, the assay is usually called a radioimmunoassay .\nIn a variant of the competitive binding assay, the antibody\nis bound covalently to the surface of beads. It is then easy to\nseparate the bound and free ligand simply by washing the beads\nwith ice-cold buffer, leaving the bound ligand attached to the\nbeads for measurement of bound radioactivity. Alternatively,\nthe antibody may be bound covalently to the surface of the test\ntube, or to each well in a multiwell plate. After incubation, a\nsample of the incubation medium is taken for measurement of\nthe radioactivity that is not bound.\nIncreasingly, in order to minimize exposure to radioactive\nmaterials, fluorescently labeled ligand or antibody is used. A\nfurther development is the sandwich assay , in which two dif-\nferent antibodies against the ligand are used, each of which\nbinds to a different region (epitope) of the analyte. The first\nantibody is covalently bound to the surface of each well of a\nmultiple well plate, and the sample is added and incubated.\nAfter removal of the incubation medium and washing each\nwell, the second antibody is added, sandwiching the ana-\nlyte between the two antibodies. The second antibody can\nbe labeled with a radioactive isotope or a fluorophore, thus\npermitting measurement of the bound second antibody, and\nhence bound ligand. In most cases, the second antibody is\nlabeled with an enzyme. The amount of bound second anti-\nbody, and hence bound ligand, is determined by measuring\nthe activity of the enzyme bound to the walls of each well of\nthe plate, after washing to remove unbound second antibody\nand adding the enzyme substrate. This is the enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) .\nDry Chemistry Dipsticks\nFor a number of assays, the enzymes or antibodies and reagents\ncan \nbe combined on a plastic strip. For measurement of blood\nglucose, a finger-prick blood sample is placed on the test strip\nthat contains glucose and the reagents shown in Figure 48\u20133.\nThe intensity of the blue color formed, and hence the con-\ncentration of glucose, is measured using a handheld device\ncalled the glucometer. This provides a simple and reliable\nmethod to estimate glucose at the bedside in a hospital ward,\na doctor\u2019s clinic or even at home. For urine testing, several\ndifferent assays can be included as separate pellets on a plastic\nstick called a dipstick\u2014for example, to detect or semiquanti-\ntatively estimate levels of glucose, ketone bodies, protein, and\nseveral other analytes at the same time. Similar dipsticks are\navailable to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in\nurine, as a home pregnancy test.\nScreening Neonates for Inborn Errors\nof \nMetabolism\nMany of the inborn errors of metabolism can lead to very severe\nme\nntal retardation if treatment is not initiated early enough.

            "Text": "582 SECTION X Special Topics (B)\nA major sorting decision is made early in protein bio-\nsynthesis, when specific proteins are synthesized either on\ncytosolic (free) or membrane-bound polyribosomes (see\nChapter 37). The signal hypothesis was proposed by Blobel\nand Sabatini in 1971 partly to explain the distinction between\nfree and membrane-bound polyribosomes. They proposed\nthat proteins synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes\ncontain an N-terminal signal peptide , which causes them to\nbecome attached to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticu-\nlum (ER), and facilitates protein transfer into the ER lumen. On\nthe other hand, proteins synthesized on free polyribosomes lack\nthe signal peptide and retain free movement in the cytosol. An\nimportant aspect of the signal hypothesis is that all ribosomes\nhave the same structure , and that the distinction between\nmembrane-bound and free ribosomes depends solely on the\nformer carrying proteins that have signal peptides. Because\nmany membrane proteins are synthesized on membrane-bound\npolyribosomes, the signal hypothesis plays an important role\ninconcepts of membrane assembly . ER regions containing\nattached polyribosomes are called the rough ER (RER) , and the\ndistinction between the two types of ribosomes results in two\nbranches of the protein-sorting pathway, called the cytosolic\nbranch and the RER branch (Figure 49\u20131 ).\nProteins synthesized by cytosolic polyribosomes are directed\nto mitochondria, nuclei, and peroxisomes by specific signals,\nor remain in the cytosol if they lack a signal. Any protein that\ncontains a targeting sequence that is subsequently removed is\ndesignated as a preprotein . In some cases, a second peptide is\nalso removed, and in that event the original, newly synthesized\nprotein is known as a preproprotein (eg, preproalbumin; see\nChapter 52).\nProteins synthesized and sorted in the RER branch (see\nFigure 49\u20131) include many destined for various membranes\n(eg, of the ER, Golgi apparatus [GA], plasma membrane\n[PM]), and also lysosomal enzymes. In addition, proteins for\nexport from the cell via exocytosis (secretion) are synthe-\nsized via this route. These various proteins may thus reside\nin the membranes or lumen of the ER, or follow the majortransport route of intracellular proteins to the GA. In the\nsecretory orexocytotic pathway , proteins are transported\nfrom the ER \u2192GA\u2192PM and then released into the exter-\nnal environment. Secretion may be constitutive , meaning that\ntransport occurs continuously, or regulated , where transport\nis switched on and off as required. Proteins destined for the\nGA, the PM, certain other sites, or for constitutive secretion\nare carried in transport vesicles (Figure 49\u20132 ) (see also follow-\ning discussion). Other proteins which are subject to regulated\nsecretion are carried in secretory vesicles (see Figure 49\u20132).\nThese are particularly prominent in the pancreas and certain\nother glands. Passage of enzymes to the lysosomes using the\nmannose 6-phosphate signal is described in Chapter 46.\nThe Golgi Apparatus Is Involved in\nGlycosyla\ntion & Sorting of Proteins\nThe GAplays two major roles in protein synthesis. First, it\nis involved in the processing of the oligosaccharide chains\nof membrane and other N-linked glycoproteins and also con-\ntains enzymes involved in O-glycosylation (see Chapter 46).\nSecond, it is involved in the sorting of various proteins prior\nto their delivery to their appropriate intracellular destinations.\nThe GA consists of cis- (facing the ER), medial and trans-\ncisternae (membrane stacks), and the trans- Golgi network\n(TGN) (see Figure 49\u20132). All parts of the GA participate in\noligosaccharide chain processing, whereas the TGN is particu-\nlarly involved in protein sorting, and is very rich in vesicles.\nChaperones Are Proteins That Stabilize\nUnfolded \nor Partially Folded Proteins\nMolecular chaperones ar e proteins which stabilize unfolded\nor partially folded intermediates , allowing them time to fold\ncovalently and preventing inappropriate interactions, thus com-\nbating the formation of nonfunctional structures. Three families\nof these proteins are known, Hsp70, Hsp 90, and Hsp33. Most\nchaperones exhibit ATPase activity and bind ADP and ATP .\nThis activity is important for their effect on protein folding.Proteins\nMitochondrial\nNuclear\nP\neroxisomal\nCytosolic\nER membrane\nGA membrane\nPlasma membrane\nSecretory\nLysosomal enzymes(1) Cytosolic\n(2) RERPolyribosomes\nFIGURE 49\u20131 The two branches of protein sorting.

The ATP-chaperone complex, in turn,\nreleases segments of the protein that have folded properly, and\nthecycle involving ADP and ATP binding is repeated until the\nprotein is released. Chaperones are required for the correct tar-\ngeting of proteins to their subcellular locations. A number of\nimportant properties of these proteins are listed in Table 49\u20132 .\nChaperonins are a second type of chaperone which enable\nthe correct folding of denatured proteins. They also differ\nfrom chaperones in that they are much larger, being oligomers\nwith a molecular weight of 800 kDa as compared to monomers\nof 70 to 100 kDa. The structure of the bacterial chaperonin\nGroEL/GroES has been studied in detail. It has two ring-like\nstructures, each composed of seven identical subunits, whichform barrel-like shape, and again ATP is involved in its action.\nIts structure allows it to sequester an unfolded protein away\nfrom other proteins, giving it time and suitable conditions to\nfold properly. The heat shock protein Hsp60 is the equivalent\nof GroEL in eukaryotes.\nTHE CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN\nSORTING \nBRANCH DIRECTS\nPROTEINS TO SUBCELLULAR\nORGANELLES\nProteins synthesized via the cytosolic sorting branch either\nhav\ne no targeting signal, if they are destined for the cytosol,\nor they contain a signal which enables them to be taken upEarly\nendosome\nGolgi\ncomplexLy\nsosomePlasma membrane\nEndoplasmic\nreticulum\nNuclear\nenvelopeNucleusCOP I\nCOP I\nCOP IIERGICTGN\ntrans\nmedial\ncisTransport\nvesicleLate endosome\nSecretory vesicleClathrin\nImmature secretory vesicle\nFIGURE 49\u20132 The rough ER branch of protein sorting.

Proteins that are transported out of the ER are carried\nin COPII vesicles to the cis-Golgi (anterograde transport). Proteins move through the Golgi as the cisternae (membrane sac-like structures) mature.\nIn the trans -Golgi network (TGN), the exit side of the Golgi, proteins are segregated and sorted. For regulated secretion, proteins accumulate in\nsecretory vesicles, while proteins destined for insertion in the plasma membrane for constitutive secretion are carried to the cell surface in trans-\nport vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in endocytosis, carrying cargo to late endosomes and to lysosomes. Mannose 6-phosphate\n(not shown; see Chapter 46) acts as a signal for transporting enzymes to lysosomes. COPI vesicles transport protein from GA to the ER (retrograde\ntransport) and may be involved in some intra-Golgi transport.

Specific uptake signals\ndirect \nproteins to the mitochondria, nucleus, and peroxisomes\n(see Table 49\u20131). Since protein synthesis is complete before\ntransport occurs, these processes are termed posttranslational\ntranslocation.\nSpecific mechanisms for the import of proteins into mito-\nchondria, the nucleus, peroxisomes, and the ER are discussed\nin the following discussion, but in general, there are usu-\nally three stages, recognition, translocation, and maturation.\nEnergy is required for translocation and chaperone proteins\nplay a part in keeping the protein unfolded and in pulling of\nthe protein through the membrane. Folding and processing of\nthe newly translocated protein is carried out by other proteins\nwithin the organelle.\nMost Mitochondrial Proteins\nAre \nImported\nMitochondria con tain many proteins. Thirteen polypeptides\n(mostly membrane components of the electron transport chain)\nare encoded by the mitochondrial (mt) genome and synthe-\nsized in that organelle using its own protein-synthesizing system.\nHowever, the vast majority (at least several hundreds) are\nencoded by nuclear genes , and synthesized outside the mito-\nchondria on cytosolic polyribosomes , and must be imported.\nMost progress has been made in the study of proteins present\ninthe mitochondrial matrix , such as the ATP synthase sub-\nunits (see Chapter 13). Only the pathway of import of matrix\nproteins will be discussed in any detail here.\nMatrix proteins must pass from cytosolic polyribosomes\nthrough the outer andinner mitochondrial membranes to\nreach their destination. Passage through the two membranes\nis called translocation . They have an amino terminal leader\nsequence (presequence) , about 20 to 50 amino acids in length\n(see Table 49\u20131), which is amphipathic and contains many\nhydrophobic and positively charged amino acids (eg, Lys or\nArg). The presequence is equivalent to a signal peptide medi-\nating attachment of polyribosomes to membranes of the ER\n(see later), but in this instance it targets proteins to the matrix .\nSome general features of the passage of a protein from the cyto-\nsol to the mitochondrial matrix are shown in Figure 49\u20133 .Translocation occurs posttranslationally , after the matrix\npreproteins are released from the cytosolic polyribosomes.\nInteractions with a number of cytosolic proteins that act as\nchaperones (see later) and as targeting factors occur prior to\ntranslocation.\nTwo distinct translocation complexes are situated in\nthe outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, referred to\n(respectively) as translocase of the outer membrane (TOM)\nand translocase of the inner membrane ( TIM ). Each complex\nhas been analyzed and found to be composed of a number of\nproteins, some of which act as receptors (eg,Tom20/22 ) for\nthe incoming proteins and others as components (eg,Tom40 )\nof the transmembrane pores through which these proteins\nmust pass. Proteins must be in the unfolded state to pass\nthrough the complexes, and this is made possible by ATP-\ndependent binding to several chaperone proteins including\nHsp70 (see Figure 49\u20133). In mitochondria, chaperones are\ninvolved in translocation, sorting, folding, assembly, and deg-\nradation of imported proteins. A proton-motive force across\nthe inner membrane is required for import; it is made up of\ntheelectric potential across the membrane (inside negative)\nand the pH gradient (see Chapter 13). The positively charged\nleader sequence may be helped through the membrane by the\nnegative charge in the matrix. In addition, close apposition\natcontact sites between the outer and inner membranes is\nnecessary for translocation to occur.\nThe presequence is split off in the matrix by a matrix\nprotease . Contact with other chaperones present in the\nmatrix is essential to complete the overall process of import.\nInteraction with mt-Hsp70 (mt = mitochondrial; Hsp = heat\nshock protein; 70 = ~70 kDa) ensures proper import into the\nmatrix and prevents misfolding or aggregation, while inter-\naction with the mt-Hsp60\u2013Hsp10 system ensures proper\nfolding. The interactions of imported proteins with the above\nchaperones require hydrolysis of ATP to drive them.\nThe above describes the major pathway of proteins des-\ntined for the mitochondrial matrix. However, certain proteins\ninsert into the outer mitochondrial membrane facilitated\nby the TOM complex. Others remain in the intermembrane\nspace , and some insert into the inner membrane . Yet others\nproceed into the matrix and then return to the inner membrane\nor intermembrane space. A number of proteins contain two sig-\nnaling sequences\u2014one to enter the mitochondrial matrix and\nthe other to mediate subsequent relocation (eg, into the inner\nmembrane). Certain mitochondrial proteins do not contain\npresequences (eg, cytochrome c, which locates in the inter-\nmembrane space), and others contain internal presequences .\nOverall, proteins employ a variety of mechanisms and routes\nto attain their final destinations in mitochondria.\nTransport of Macromolecules\nin \n& out of the Nucleus Involves\nLocalization Signals\nIt has been estimated that more than a million macromole-\ncu\nles per minute are transported between the nucleus andTABLE 49\u20132 Some Properties of Chaperone Proteins\n\u2022Pres ent in a wide range of species from bacteria to humans\n\u2022Many are so-called heat shock proteins (Hsp), which are induced\nby stressors including heat, oxidants, toxins, free radicals, and\nviruses\n\u2022Some are inducible by conditions that cause unfolding of newly\nsynthesized proteins (eg, elevated temperature and various\nchemicals)\n\u2022They bind to predominantly hydrophobic regions of unfolded pro-\nteins and prevent their aggregation\n\u2022They act in part as a quality control or editing mechanism for\ndetecting misfolded or otherwise defective proteins\n\u2022Most chaperones show associated ATPase activity, with ATP or ADP\nbeing involved in the protein-chaperone interaction\n\u2022Found in various cellular compartments such as cytosol, mitochon-\ndria, and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum"

One\nexample of an NLS is the amino acid sequence (Pro)2-(Lys)3-\nArg-L\nys-Val (see Table 49\u20131), which is markedly rich in basic\nresidues. A cargo molecule containing an NLS interacts with\nimportin , a soluble protein which has two subunits, termed \u03b1\nand \u03b2. For the transport of proteins into the nucleus, importinusually functions as a heterodimer, importin \u03b1/\u03b2. The \u03b1 sub-\nunit binds to the NLS and the complex docks transiently at\nthe NPC via interaction with the \u03b2 subunit. Another family of\nproteins called Ran plays a critical regulatory role in the inter-\naction of the complex with the NPC and in its translocation\nthrough the NPC. Ran proteins are small monomeric nuclear\nGTPases and, like other GTPases, exist in either GTP-bound or\nGDP-bound states. They are themselves regulated by guanine\nnucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) , which are located in\nthe nucleus, and Ran GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) ,\nwhich are predominantly cytoplasmic. The GTP-bound state\nof Ran is favored in the nucleus and the GDP-bound state\nin the cytoplasm. The conformations and activities of Ran\nmolecules vary depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound\nto them (the GTP-bound state is active; see discussion of\nG-proteins in Chapter 42). The asymmetry between nucleus\nand cytoplasm\u2014with respect to which of these two nucleo-\ntides is bound to Ran molecules\u2014is thought to be crucial\nin understanding the roles of Ran in transferring complexes\nunidirectionally across the NPC.

Biochemical findings include\nan accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids, abnormali-\nties of the synthesis of bile acids, and a marked reduction of\nplasmalogens. The condition is usually caused by mutations\nin genes encoding certain proteins, such as the PEX family of\ngenes (also called peroxins ), involved in various steps of per-\noxisome biogenesis (eg, the import of proteins described earlier\nand in Figure 49\u22125), or in genes encoding certain peroxisomal\nenzymes themselves.

For\nexample, mutant proteins containing altered signal peptides in\nwhich hydrophobic amino acids are replaced by hydrophilic\nones are not inserted into the lumen of the ER. On the other\nhand, nonmembrane proteins (eg, \u03b1-globin) to which signal\npeptides have been attached by genetic engineering can be\ninserted into the lumen of the ER, or even secreted.\nTranslocation of Proteins to the\nEndoplasmic \nReticulum May Be\nCotranslational or Posttranslational\nMost nascent proteins are transferred across the ER mem-\nbra\nne into the lumen by the cotranslational pathway , so called\nbecause the process occurs during ongoing protein synthesis.The process of elongation of the remaining portion of the pro-\ntein being synthesized probably facilitates passage of the nascent\nprotein across the lipid bilayer. It is important that proteins be\nkept in an unfolded state prior to entering the conducting\nchannel\u2014otherwise, they may not be able to gain access to the\nchannel. The pathway involves a number of specialized pro-\nteins, including the signal recognition particle (SRP) , theSRP\nreceptor (SRP-R) , and the translocon . The translocon consists\nof three membrane proteins (the Sec61 complex) that form a\nprotein-conducting channel in the ER membrane through\nwhich the newly synthesized protein may pass. The channel\nopens only when a signal peptide is present . Closure of the\nchannel when proteins are not being translocated prevents ions\nsuch as calcium and other molecules leaking through it, caus-\ning cell dysfunction. The process proceeds in five steps sum-\nmarized as follows and in Figure 49\u20136 .\nStep 1: The signal sequence emerges from the ribosome\nand binds to the SRP. The SRP contains six proteins asso-\nciated with an RNA molecule, and each of these plays a\nrole (eg, binding of another molecule) in its function. This\nstep temporarily stops further elongation of the polypep-\ntide chain (elongation arrest) after some 70 amino acids\nhave been polymerized.\nStep 2: The SRP-ribosome-nascent protein complex trav-\nels to the ER membrane, where it binds to the SRP-R , an\nER membrane protein composed of two subunits. The \u03b1\nsubunit (SRP-R\u03b1) binds the SRP complex and the mem-\nbrane-spanning \u03b2 subunit (SRP-R\u03b2) anchors SRP-R\u03b1 in\nthe ER membrane. The SRP guides the complex to the\nSRP-R, preventing premature expulsion of the growing\npolypeptide into the cytosol.\nStep 3: The SRP is released, translation resumes, the ribo-\nsome binds to the translocon (Sec 61 complex) , and the\nsignal peptide inserts into the channel in the translocon.\nSRP and both subunits of the SRP-R bind GTP , this enables\ntheir interaction, resulting in the hydrolysis of GTP .\nStep 4: The signal peptide induces opening of the channel\nin the translocon, by causing the plug (shown at the bottom\non the translocon in Figure 49\u20136) to move. The growing\npolypeptide is then fully translocated across the membrane,\ndriven by its ongoing synthesis.\nStep 5: Cleavage of the signal peptide by signal peptidase\noccurs, and the fully translocated polypeptide/protein\nis released into the lumen of the ER. The signal peptide\nis degraded by proteases. Ribosomes are released from\nthe ER membrane and dissociate into their two types of\nsubunits.\nSecretory proteins and soluble proteins destined for\norganelles distal to the ER completely traverse the mem-\nbrane bilayer and are discharged into the lumen.

In particular, the amino termini of\ncertain proteins (eg, the low-density lipoprotein [LDL] receptor)can be seen to be on the extracytoplasmic face, whereas for\nother proteins (eg, the asialoglycoprotein receptor) the carboxyl\ntermini are on this face. These dispositions are explained by\nthe initial biosynthetic events at the ER membrane. Proteins\nlike the LDL receptor enter the ER membrane in a manner\nanalogous to a secretory protein (see Figure 49\u20136); they partly\ntraverse the ER membrane, the signal peptide is cleaved, and their\namino terminal protrudes into the lumen. However, this type of\nprotein contains a highly hydrophobic segment which acts as\nahalt- or stop-transfer signal and causes its retention in the\nmembrane ( Figure 49\u20139 ). This sequence has its N-terminal\nend in the ER lumen and the C-terminal in the cytosol; the\nstop-transfer signal forms the single transmembrane segment\nof the protein and is its membrane-anchoring domain. The\nprotein is believed to exit the translocon into the membrane\nby a lateral gate which opens and closes continuously allowing\nhydrophobic sequences to enter the lipid bilayer.\nThe small patch of ER membrane in which the newly\nsynthesized LDL receptor is located subsequently buds off\nas a component of a transport vesicle which eventually fuses\nwith the PM so that the C-terminal faces the cytosol and the\nN-terminal faces the outside of the cell. In contrast, the asialo-\nglycoprotein receptor lacks a cleavable N-terminal signal\npeptide, but possesses an internal insertion sequence , which\ninserts into the membrane but is not cleaved. This acts as an\nanchor, and its C-terminus is extruded through the membrane\ninto the ER lumen. Cytochrome P450 is anchored in a similar\nway, but its N-terminal, rather than C-terminal, is extruded\ninto the lumen. The more complex disposition of a trans-\nmembrane transporter (eg, for glucose) which may cross the\nmembrane up to 12 times, can be explained by the fact that\nalternating transmembrane \u03b1-helices act as uncleaved insertion\nsequences and as halt-transfer signals, respectively.

They then return to the ER in vesicles coatedwith coat protein I (COPI, retrograde vesicular transport) ,\nwhere they dissociate from the receptor, and are thus retrieved.\nHDEL sequences (H = histidine) serve a similar purpose. The\nabove processes result in net localization of certain soluble\nproteins to the ER lumen.\nCertain other non-KDEL\u2013containing proteins also pass\nto the Golgi and then return, by retrograde vesicular trans-\nport, to the ER to be inserted therein. These include vesicle\ncomponents that must be recycled, as well as certain ER mem-\nbrane proteins. These proteins often possess a C-terminal sig-\nnal located in the cytosol rich in basic residues.\nThus, proteins reach the ER membrane by a variety of\nroutes , and similar pathways are likely to be used for other\nmembranes (eg, the mitochondrial membranes and the PM).\nPrecise targeting sequences have been identified in some\ninstances (eg, KDEL sequences).\nThe topic of membrane biogenesis is discussed further\nlater in this chapter.\nTHE ER FUNCTIONS AS\nTHE \nQUALITY CONTROL\nCOMPARTMENT OF THE CELL\nAfter entering the ER, newly synthesized proteins fold with\nthe \nassistance of chaperones and folding enzymes, and their\nfolding status is monitored by chaperones and also enzymes\n(Table 49\u20135) .Signal\nsequenceStop-transfer\nsequence\nStop-transfer\nsequenceTop view\nNNC\n5\u00b4  3\u00b4  5\u00b4  3\u00b4 5\u00b4  3\u00b4 5\u00b4  3\u00b4\nTop view Signal\npeptidase\nEndoplasmic\nreticulum lumenCytosol\nFIGURE 49\u20139 Insertion of a membrane protein with a stop-transfer signal into the ER membrane.

This protein binds a wide variety of\nproteins, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\nantigens and a variety of plasma proteins. As described in\nChapter 46, calnexin binds the monoglucosylated species of\nglycoproteins that occur during processing of glycoproteins,\nretaining them in the ER until the glycoprotein has folded\nproperly. Calreticulin , which is also a calcium-binding pro-\ntein, has properties similar to those of calnexin, but it is not\nmembrane-bound. In addition to chaperones, two enzymes in\nthe ER lumen are concerned with proper folding of proteins.\nProtein disulfide isomerase (PDI) promotes rapid forma-\ntion and reshuffling of disulfide bonds until the correct set is\nachieved. Peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPI) accelerates folding\nof proline-containing proteins by catalyzing the cis\u2013trans isom-\nerization of X-Pro bonds, where X is any amino acid residue.\nMisfolded or incompletely folded proteins interact with\nchaperones, which retain them in the ER and prevent them\nfrom being exported to their final destinations. If such interac-\ntions continue for a prolonged period of time, harmful buildup\nof misfolded proteins is avoided by ER-associated degradation\n(ERAD) . In a number of genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis,\nmisfolded proteins are retained in the ER, and in some cases,\nthe retained proteins still exhibit some functional activity. As\ndiscussed later in this chapter, drugs that will interact with such\nproteins and promote their correct folding and export out of the\nER are currently under investigation.\nMISFOLDED PROTEINS UNDERGO\nENDOPLASMIC \nRETICULUM\u2013\nASSOCIATED DEGRADATION\nMaintenance of homeostasis in the ER is important for normal\ncell function. Perturbation of the unique environment within\nthe lumen of the ER (eg, by changes in ER Ca2+, alterations of\nredox sta\ntus, exposure to various toxins or some viruses), can\nlead to reduced protein folding capacity and the accumulation\nof misfolded proteins. The accumulation of misfolded proteins\nin the ER is referred to as ER stress . The unfolded protein\nresponse (UPR) is a mechanism within cells which senses the\nlevels of misfolded proteins and activates intracellular signal-\ning mechanisms to restore ER homeostasis. The UPR is initi-\nated by ER stress sensors , which are transmembrane proteinsembedded in the ER membrane. Their activation causes three\nprincipal effects: (1) transient inhibition of translation so that\nthe synthesis of new proteins is reduced, (2) induction of tran-\nscription to increase the expression of ER chaperones, and\n(3) increased synthesis of proteins involved in the degrada-\ntion of misfolded ER proteins (discussed later). Thus, the UPR\nincreases the ER folding capacity and prevents a buildup of\nunproductive and potentially toxic protein products, as well\nas promoting other responses to restore cellular homeostasis.\nHowever, if impairment of folding persists, cell death pathways\n(apoptosis) are activated. A more complete understanding of\nthe UPR is likely to provide new approaches to treating dis-\neases in which ER stress and defective protein folding occur\n(Table 49\u20136 ).\nProteins that misfold in the ER are degraded by the ERAD\npathway (Figure 49\u201310) . This process selectively transports\nboth luminal and membrane proteins back across the ER\n(retrograde translocation or dislocation) into the cytosol\nwhere they are degraded in proteasomes (see Chapter 28).\nChaperones present in the lumen of the ER (eg, BiP) help to\ntarget misfolded proteins to proteasomes.\nThe assembly of the retrotranslocation translocon com-\nprising a number of proteins is initiated by recognition ofTABLE 49\u20135 Some Chaperones & Enzymes Involved in\nFolding \nThat Are Located in the Rough Endoplasmic\nReticulum\n\u2022BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein) (also called\nGRP78 or Hsp70)\n\u2022GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein)\n\u2022GRP170\n\u2022Hsp47\n\u2022Calnexin\n\u2022Calreticulin\n\u2022PDI (protein disulfide isomerase)\n\u2022PPI (peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase)\nTABLE 49\u20136 Some Conformational Diseases That Are\nCaused \nby Abnormalities in Intracellular Transport of\nSpecific Proteins & Enzymes due to Mutations\nDisease Affected Protein\n\u03b11-Antitrypsin deficiency with\nliver \ndisease\u03b11-Antitrypsin\nChediak-Higashi \nsyndrome Lysosomal trafficking regulator\nCombined deficiency of factors\nV and VIIIERGIC53, a mannose-binding\nlectin\nCystic fibrosis CFTR\nDiabetes mellitus (some cases) Insulin receptor (\u03b1-subunit)\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia,\nautosomal dominantLDL receptor\nGaucher disease \u03b2-Glucosidase\nHemophilia A and B Factors VIII and IX\nHereditary hemochromatosis HFE\nHermansky-Pudlak syndrome AP-3 adaptor complex \u03b23A\nsubunit\nI-cell disease N-acetylglucosamine\n1-phosphotransferase\nLowe oculocerebrorenal\nsyndromePIP25-phosphatase\nT\nay-Sachs disease \u03b2-Hexosaminidase\nvon Willebrand disease von Willebrand factor\nAbbreviations : LDL, low-density lipoprotein; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.\nData \nfrom Schr\u00f6der M, Kaufman RJ.

As ret-\nrotranslocation occurs, misfolded proteins are polyubiquinated\n(see Chaper 28) by ubiquitin ligases on the cytosolic side, and\nare then pulled from the membrane by P97(also called Vcp),\nanATPase and delivered to the proteasome for degradation\n(see Figure 49\u221210).\nUbiquitin Is a Key Molecule in\nProtein \nDegradation\nThere are two major pathways of protein degradation in\neukaryotes. \nOne involves lysosomal proteases and does not\nrequire ATP , but the major pathway involves ubiquitin and is\nATP-dependent. The ubiquitin pathway is particularly asso-\nciated with disposal of misfolded proteins and regulatory\nenzymes that have short half-lives . Ubiquitin is known to be\ninvolved in diverse important physiologic processes including\ncell cycle regulation (degradation of cyclins), DNA repair,\ninflammation andthe immune response (see Chapter 52),\nmuscle wasting, viral infections , and many others . Ubiquitin\nis a small (76 amino acids), highly conserved protein that tags\nvarious proteins for degradation in proteasomes. The mechanism\nof attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein (eg, a misfolded\nform of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\n[CFTR], the protein involved in the causation of cystic fibrosis;\nsee Chapter 40) is shown in Figure 28\u20132 and the process is\ndescribed in detail in Chapter 28.Ubiquitinated Proteins Are Degraded\nin \nProteasomes\nPolyubiquitinated target proteins enter protea somes located\nin the cytosol. Proteasomes are protein complexes with a\nrelatively large cylindrical structure and are composed of\nfour rings with a hollow core containing the protease active\nsites, and one or two caps orregulatory particles that recog-\nnize the polyubiquinated substrates and initiate degradation\n(see Figures 28\u20133 and 28\u20134). Target proteins are unfolded by\nATPases present in the proteasome caps and pass into the\ncore to be degraded to small peptides, which then exit the\nproteasome to be further degraded by cytosolic peptidases.\nBoth normally and abnormally folded proteins are substrates\nfor the proteasome, which can hydrolyze a wide variety of\npeptide bonds. Liberated ubiquitin molecules are recycled.\nThe proteasome plays an important role in presenting small\npeptides produced by degradation of various viruses and\nother molecules to MHC class I molecules , a key step in anti-\ngen presentation to T lymphocytes.\nTRANSPORT VESICLES ARE KEY\nPLA\nYERS IN INTRACELLULAR\nPROTEIN TRAFFIC\nProteins that are synthesized on membrane-bound polyribo-\nsomes \nand are destined for the Golgi or PM reach these sites\ninside transport vesicles . As indicated in Table 49\u20137 , there\nare a number of different types of vesicles. There may be other\ntypes of vesicles still to be discovered.\nEach vesicle has its own set of coat proteins. Clathrin is\nused in vesicles destined for exocytosis (see discussions of\nthe LDL receptor in Chapters 25 and 26) and in some of those\ncarrying cargo to lysosomes. This protein consists of three\ninterlocking spirals, which interact to form a lattice around\nthe vesicle.

Here we focus\nmainly on COPII, COPI, and clathrin-coated vesicles. Each\ntype has a different complement of proteins in its coat. For the\nsake of clarity, the non\u2013clathrin-coated vesicles are referred to\nin this text as transport vesicles . The principles concerning\nassembly of these different types are generally similar, although\nsome details of assembly for COPI and clathrin-coated vesicles\ndiffer from those for COPII (see following discussion).\nTransport Vesicle Formation and\nFu\nnction Involves SNAREs & Other\nFactors\nVesicles lie at the heart of intracellular transport of many pro-\nteins. Genetic approaches and cell-free systems have been\nused to elucidate the mechanisms of their formation and trans-\nport. The overall process is complex, and involves a variety of\ncytosolic and membrane proteins, GTP , ATP , and accessory\nfactors. Budding, tethering, docking , and membrane fusion\nare key steps in the life cycles of vesicles, with the GTP-binding\nproteins, Sar1, ARF , and Rab acting as molecular switches .\nSar1 is the protein involved in step 1 of formation of COPII\nvesicles, whereas ARF is involved in the formation of COPI\nand clathrin-coated vesicles. The functions of the various pro-\nteins involved in vesicle processing and the abbreviations used\nare shown in Table 49\u20138 .\nThere are common general steps in transport vesicle\nformation, vesicle targeting, and fusion with a target mem-\nbrane, irrespective of the membrane the vesicle forms from or\nits intracellular destination. The nature of the coat proteins,\nGTPases and targeting factors differ depending on where thevesicle forms from and its eventual destination. Anterograde\ntransport from the ER to the Golgi involving COPII vesicles\nis the best studied example. The process can be considered to\noccur in eight steps ( Figure 49\u201311 ). The basic concept is that\neach transport vesicle is loaded with specific cargo and also\none or more v-SNARE proteins that direct targeting. Each tar-\nget membrane bears one or more complementary t-SNARE\nproteins with which v-SNAREs interact, mediating SNARE\nprotein-dependent vesicle\u2013membrane fusion. In addition,\nRab proteins also help direct the vesicles to specific mem-\nbranes and their tethering at a target membrane.\nStep 1: Budding is initiated when the GTPase Sar1 is\nactivated by binding of GTP in exchange for GDP via the\naction of the GEF Sec12p (see Table 49\u20139), switching it\nfrom a soluble to a membrane bound form via confor-\nmational change which exposes a hydrophobic tail. This\nenables it to become embedded in the ER membrane to\nform a focal point for vesicle assembly.\nStep 2: Forbud formation , various coat proteins bind to\nSar1\u00b7GTP . In turn, membrane cargo proteins bind to the\ncoat proteins either directly or via intermediary proteins that\nattach to coat proteins, and they then become enclosed\nin their appropriate vesicles. Soluble cargo proteins bind\nto receptor regions inside the vesicles. A number of signal\nsequences on cargo molecules have been identified\n(see Table 49\u20131). For example, KDEL sequences direct\ncertain proteins in retrograde flow from the Golgi to the\nER in COPI vesicles. Diacidic sequences (eg, Asp-X-Glu,\nX = any amino acid) and short hydrophobic sequences\non membrane proteins destined for the Golgi membrane\nare involved in interactions with coat proteins of COPII\nvesicles. However, not all cargo molecules have a sorting\nsignal. Some highly abundant secretory proteins travel\nto various cellular destinations in transport vesicles by\nbulk flow ; that is, they enter into transport vesicles at\nthe same concentration that they occur in the organelle.\nHowever, it appears that most proteins are actively sorted\n(concentrated) into transport vesicles and bulk flow is\nused by only a select group of cargo proteins. Additional\ncoat proteins are assembled to complete bud formation .\nCoat proteins promote budding, contribute to the curva-\nture of buds, and also help sort proteins.\nStep 3: The bud pinches off , completing formation of\nthe coated vesicle. The curvature of the ER membrane\nand protein\u2013protein and protein-lipid interactions in\nthe bud facilitate pinching off from ER exit sites. Vesicles\nmove through cells along microtubules or along actin\nfilaments .\nStep 4: Coat disassembly, or uncoating (involving dis-\nsociation ofSar1 and the shell of coat proteins) follows\nhydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by Sar1, promoted by\na specific coat protein. Sar1 thus plays key roles in both\nassembly and dissociation of the coat proteins. Uncoating\nis necessary for fusion to occur.TABLE 49\u20138 Some Factors Involved in the Formation of\nNon\u2013Clathrin-Coated \nVesicles & Their Transport\n\u2022ARF: ADP-ribosylation factor, a GTPase involved in formation of\nCOPI and also clathrin-coated vesicles.\n\u2022Coat proteins: A family of proteins found in coated vesicles.

They are\nsmall monomeric GTPases that attach to the cytosolic\nfaces of budding vesicles in the GTP-bound state and are\nalso present on acceptor membranes. Rab\u00b7GDP molecules\nin the cytosol are switched to Rab\u00b7GTP molecules by a\nspecific GEF (see Table 49\u20139).

NSF hydro-\nlyzes ATP and the energy released dissociates the four-\nhelix bundle making the SNARE proteins available for\nanother round of membrane fusion.\nStep 8: Certain components, such as the Rab and SNARE\nproteins, are recycled for subsequent rounds of vesicle\nfusion.\nDuring the above cycle, SNARES, tethering proteins, Rab,\nand other proteins all collaborate to deliver a vesicle and its\ncontents to the appropriate site.\nSome Transport Vesicles Travel via the\nT\nrans -Golgi Network\nProteins found in the apical orbasolateral areas of the PMs\nof polarized epithelial cells may be transported to these sites in\nvarious ways; in transport vesicles budding from the trans-\nGolgi network , with different Rab proteins directing some\nvesicles to apical regions and others to basolateral regions;\nvia initial direction to the basolateral membrane, followed by\nendocytosis and transport across the cell by transcytosis to\nthe apical region; or via a process involving the glycosylphos-\nphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor described in Chapter 46. This\nstructure is also often present in lipid rafts (see Chapter 40).\nOnce proteins in the secretory pathway reach the cis-\nGolgi from the ER, they may be retained in vesicles for travel\nthrough the Golgi to the trans- Golgi, or they may cross by a\nprocess called cisternal maturation , in which the cisternae\n(the flattened membrane disks of the Golgi that bud off\nfrom the ER) move and transform into one another, or per-\nhaps in some cases diffusion via intracisternal connections.\nIn this model, vesicular elements from the ER fuse with one\nanother to help form the cis-Golgi, which in turn can move\nforward toward the trans -Golgi. COPI vesicles return Golgi\nenzymes (eg, glycosyltransferases) back from distal ( trans- )\ncisternae of the Golgi to more proximal ( cis) cisternae.\nThe fungal metabolite brefeldin A inhibits the forma-\ntion of COPI vesicles by preventing GTP from binding to\nARF . In its presence, the GA appears to collapse into the ER.\nBrefeldin A has proven to be a useful tool for examining some\naspects of Golgi structure and function.Some Proteins Undergo Further\nProcessing \nWhile Inside Vesicles\nSome proteins are subjected to further processing by prote-\nolysis while inside either transport or secretory vesicles. For\nexample, albumin is synthesized by hepatocytes as preproal-\nbumin (see Chapter 52). Its signal peptide is removed, con-\nverting it to proalbumin . In turn, proalbumin, while inside\nsecretory vesicles, is converted to albumin by action of furin\n(Figure 49\u201312 ). This enzyme cleaves a hexapeptide from pro-\nalbumin immediately C-terminal to a dibasic amino acid site\n(ArgArg). The resulting mature albumin is secreted into the\nplasma. Hormones such as insulin (see Chapter 41) are subjected\nto similar proteolytic cleavages while inside secretory vesicles.\nTHE ASSEMBLY OF MEMBRANES\nIS \nCOMPLEX\nThere are a number of different types of cell membranes, rang-\ning \nfrom the PM which separates the cell contents from the\nexternal environment to the internal membranes of subcellular\norganelles, such a mitochondria and the ER. Although the\ngeneral lipid bilayer structure is similar in all membranes, they\ndiffer in their specific protein and lipid content and each type\nhas its own specific features (see Chapter 40). No satisfactory\nscheme describing the assembly of any one of these membranes\nis currently available. Vesicular transport and the way in which\nvarious proteins are initially inserted into the membrane of\nthe ER have been discussed earlier. Some general points about\nmembrane assembly are addressed in the following discussion.\nAsymmetry of Both Proteins & Lipids\nIs \nMaintained During Membrane\nAssembly\nVesicles formed from membranes of the ER and GA, either\nnatura\nlly or pinched off by homogenization, exhibit trans-\nverse asymmetries of both lipid and protein. These asym-\nmetries are maintained during fusion of transport vesicles\nwith the PM. The inside of the vesicles after fusion becomes\ntheoutside of the plasma membrane , and the cytoplasmic side\nof the vesicles remains the cytoplasmic side of the membrane\n(Figure 49\u201313 ).

            "Text": "CHAPTER 49 Intracellular Traffic & Sorting of Proteins 597\nof phospholi\npids, the major class of lipids in membranes (see\nChapter 40) reside in the cytoplasmic surface of the cisternae\n(the sac-like structures) of the ER. Phospholipids are syn-\nthesized at that site, and it is thought that they self-assemble\ninto thermodynamically stable bimolecular layers, thereby\nexpanding the membrane and perhaps promoting the detach-\nment of so-called lipid vesicles from it. It has been proposed\nthat these vesicles travel to other sites, donating their lipids to\nother membranes. Phospholipid exchange proteins are cyto-\nsolic proteins that take up phospholipids from one membrane\nand release them to another are believed to play a role in regu-\nlating the specific lipid composition of various membranes.\nIt should be noted that the lipid compositions of the ER,\nGolgi, and PM differ, the latter two membranes containinghigher amounts of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and gly-\ncosphingolipids , and less phosphoglycerides than does the\nER. Sphingolipids pack more densely in membranes than do\nphosphoglycerides. These differences affect the structures and\nfunctions of membranes. For example, the thickness of the\nbilayer of the Golgi and plasma membrane is greater than that\nof the ER, which affects which particular transmembrane\nproteins are found in these organelles. Also, lipid rafts (see\nChapter 40) are believed to be formed in the Golgi.\nLipids & Proteins Undergo Turnover at\nDifferent \nRates in Different Membranes\nIt has been shown that the half-lives of the lipids of the ER mem-\nbr\nanes are generally shorter than those of its proteins, so that the\nturnover rates of lipids and proteins are independent . Indeed,\ndifferent lipids have been found to have different half-lives.\nFurthermore, the half-lives of the proteins of these membranes\nvary widely, some exhibiting short (hours) and others long (days)\nhalf-lives. Thus, individual lipids and proteins of the ER mem-\nbranes appear to be inserted into it relatively independently and\nthis is believed to be the case for many other membranes.\nThe biogenesis of membranes is thus a complex process\nabout which much remains to be learned. One indication of the\ncomplexity involved is to consider the number of posttransla-\ntional modifications that membrane proteins may be subjected\nprior to attaining their mature state. These may include disulfide\nformation, proteolysis, assembly into multimers, glycosylation,\naddition of a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, sulfation\non tyrosine or carbohydrate moieties, phosphorylation, acyla-\ntion, and prenylation. Nevertheless, significant progress has\nbeen made; Table 49\u20139 summarizes some of the major features\nof membrane assembly that have emerged to date.\nVarious Disorders Result From\nMutations \nin Genes Encoding Proteins\nInvolved in Intracellular Transport\nSome disorders reflecting abnormal peroxisomal function\nand \nabnormalities of protein synthesis in the ERand of the\nsynthesis of lysosomal proteins have been listed earlier in this\nchapter (see Tables 49\u20133 and 49\u20136, respectively). Many other\nmutations affecting folding of proteins and their intracellular\ntransport to various organelles have been reported, includ-\ning neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\nHuntington\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. The elucidation\nof the causes of these various conformational disorders has\ncontributed significantly to our understanding of molecular\npathology . The term \u201cdiseases of proteostasis deficiency\u201d has\nalso been applied to diseases due to misfolding of proteins. Proteo-\nstasis is a composite word derived from protein homeostasis.\nNormal proteostasis is due to a balance of many factors, such\nas synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, and normal\ndegradation. If any one of these is disturbed (eg, by mutation,\naging, cell stress, or injury), a variety of disorders can occur,\ndepending on the particular proteins involved.C\nNN\nCExterior surface Membrane protein\nPlasma\nmembrane\nCytoplasm\nVesicle\nmembraneLumen\nIntegral\nprotein\nN\nC\nCCNNN\nFIGURE 49\u201313 Fusion of a vesicle with the plasma mem-\nbr\nane preserves the orientation of any integral proteins embedded\nin the vesicle bilayer.

A number of Hsp90\ninhibitors have undergone clinical trials since then, but none\nso far have been approved for use by the FDA, mainly because\nof toxicity problems. The search for an Hsp90 inhibitor suit-\nable for clinical use, however, is continuing. The chaperone\nHsp70 is another potential anticancer target currently under\ninvestigation, since it is expressed much more strongly in\ntumor cells than in normal cells. Small drug molecules that\nact as chemical chaperones have also been shown to prevent\nmisfolding and restore protein function.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Many proteins are targeted to their destinations by signal\nsequences. A \nmajor sorting decision is made when proteins are\npartitioned between cytosolic (or free) and membrane-bound\npolyribosomes by virtue of the absence or presence of an\nN-terminal signal peptide.\n\u25a0Proteins synthesized on cytosolic polyribosomes are targeted\nby \nspecific signal sequences to mitochondria, nuclei,\nperoxisomes, and the ER. Proteins which lack a signal remain\nin the cytosol.\n\u25a0Proteins synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes\ninitially en\nter the ER membrane or lumen, and many are\nultimately destined for other membranes including the\nplasma membrane and that of the Golgi, for lysosomes and for\nsecretion via exocytosis.\n\u25a0Many glycosylation reactions occur in compartments of the\nGolgi, a\nnd proteins are further sorted in the TGN.\n\u25a0Molecular chaperones stabilize unfolded or partially folded\npro\nteins. Chaperones are required for the correct targeting of\nproteins to their subcellular locations.\n\u25a0In posttranslational translocation, proteins are transported to\nthei\nr target organelles after their synthesis is complete. Proteins\ndestined for mitochondria, the nucleus, and peroxisomes follow\nthis route, as well as a minority of proteins targeted to the ER.\n\u25a0Most proteins enter the ER lumen by the cotranslational\npath\nway, where translocation occurs during ongoing protein\nsynthesis.\u25a0Proteins embedded in the ER membrane may inserted\ncotransla\ntionally, posttranslationally, or after transport to the\nGolgi (anterograde transport), transient retention, and return\nto the ER (retrograde transport).\n\u25a0Harmful buildup of misfolded proteins triggers the UPR and\nthey ar\ne degraded via the ERAD pathway. Proteins are tagged\nfor degradation by the addition of a number of ubiquitin\nmolecules and then enter the cytosol where they are broken\ndown in proteasomes.\n\u25a0Different types of transport vesicles are coated with different\np\nroteins. Clathrin-coated vesicles are destined for exocytosis and\nlysosomes, while coat proteins I and II are associated with COPI\nand COPII vesicles, which are responsible for retrograde and\nanterograde transport, respectively.\n\u25a0Transport vesicle processing is complex and requires many\npro\ntein factors. Budding from the donor membrane is followed\nby movement through the cytosol, tethering, docking, and\nfusion with the target membrane.\n\u25a0Certain proteins (eg, precursors of albumin and insulin)\nare \nsubjected to proteolysis while inside transport vesicles,\nproducing the mature proteins.\n\u25a0Small GTPases (eg, Ran, Rab) and GEFs play key roles in many\naspects of \nintracellular trafficking.\n\u25a0Vesicles formed from membranes of the ER and Golgi are\nasy\nmmetrical in both lipid and protein content. The asymmetry\nis maintained during assembly and during fusion of transport\nvesicles with the PM, so that the inside of the vesicles after fusion\nbecomes the outside of the PM, and the cytoplasmic side of the\nvesicles remains facing the cytosol.\n\u25a0Lipids and proteins are inserted into membranes independently\nand \nturn over at different rates. Exact details of the assembly\nprocess remain to be established.\n\u25a0The molecular chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70 are under intensive\nin\nvestigation as possible targets for anticancer therapy.\nREFERENCES\nAlberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al: M olecular Biology of the Cell , 6th\ned.

Skeletal andcardiac muscle display a striated\nappearance, a consequence of the parallel alignment of the\nfibrils of their contractile apparatus. Smooth muscle is devoid\nof striations, a consequence of the (more) random orienta-\ntion of its contractile fibrils. Mechanically, these differences\nin orientation mean that cardiac and skeletal muscle contract\nand exert force in only one dimension, like a coil spring, while\ncontracting smooth muscle contracts exerts force and short-\nens in all directions, like the polymer skin of an inflated bal-\nloon.

Within each individual muscle fiber cell ori-\nented longitudinally along its length are bundles of parallel\nmyofibrils , consisting of interdigitated, overlapping thick\nand thin filaments, embedded in intracellular fluid termed\nsarcoplasm . When a myofibril is examined by electron\nmicroscopy, alternating dark and light bands can be observed\n(Figure 51\u20131) .\nThese bands are referred to as Aand I bands , respec-\ntively. In the A band, the thin filaments (dark bands) arearranged around the thick filament (myosin) as a second-\nary hexagonal array. Each thin filament lies symmetrically\nbetween three thick filaments ( Figure 51\u20132 , center, mid\ncross section), and each thick filament is surrounded sym-\nmetrically by six thin filaments. The central region of the A\nband, a seemingly less dense region known as the H band ,\nconsists entirely of thick filaments. The I band (light bands)\ncorresponds to a zone containing only thin filaments, and is\nbisected by the dense and narrow Z line , which consists of\na complex network of polypeptides anchoring the thin fila-\nments together (see Figure 51\u20132).\nThe sarcomere is defined as the region between two\nZ lines (see Figures 51\u20131 and 51\u20132) and is repeated along the\naxis of a fibril at distances of 1500 to 2300 nm depending on\nthe state of contraction.

However, the manner in\nwhich contraction is regulated differs among the various typesof muscle tissue. Striated muscle relies on actin-based regu-\nlation, while regulation in smooth muscle is myosin-based .\nHowever, regardless of whether regulation is actin- or myosin-\nbased, the second messenger Ca2+plays a central role in the\ninitiation and control of contraction.\nActin-Based Regulation Occurs in\nSkeletal \nMuscle\nThe contractile apparatus in skeletal muscle is regulated by the\ntroponin \nsystem , which is bound to tropomyosin and F-actin\nin the thin filament (see Figure 51\u20133). In resting muscle, TpI\nprevents binding of the myosin head to its F-actin attach-\nment site either by altering the conformation of F-actin via the\ntropomyosin molecules or by simply rolling tropomyosin into\na position that directly blocks the sites on F-actin to which\nthe myosin heads attach. Binding of Ca2+to T pC relieves inhi-\nbition by TpI, permitting the power stroke cycle to proceed.\nWhen Ca2+levels fall, the TpC:Ca2+comp lex dissociates, allow-\ning TpI to reestablish its inhibitory block on the binding of\nthe myosin S-1 head to F-actin. The thick and thin filaments\ndetach from one another, allowing the muscle to relax.\nMyosin-Based Regulation Occurs in\nSmooth \nMuscle\nUnlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscl escontract along mul-\ntiple axes. Thus, although they have molecular structures\nsimilar to those in striated muscle, they lack striations because\ntheir sarcomeres are not aligned. Smooth muscles contain\n\u03b1-actinin and tropomyosin molecules, as do skeletal muscles,\nbut they lack the troponin system. In smooth muscle, it is the\nlight chains that prevent the binding of the myosin head to\nF-actin in the resting state. This inhibitory block is released by\nthe phosphorylation of the regulatory, or type 2, light chains in\nthe myosin S-1 head by myosin light-chain kinase. The activ-\nity of myosin light-chain kinase is controlled by the binding of\ncalmodulin ( Figure 51\u20137 ).\nCalmodulin is a small, (\u2248 17 kDa), ubiquitous protein\nthat contains four EF-hand motifs, each of which can bind\none molecule of calcium. Binding of calcium to all four of\nthese sites triggers a conformational change that enables the\n(Ca2+)4:calmodulin complex to bind to and activate various\nintracellular \ntarget enzymes, including myosin light-chain\nkinase and Ca2+-ATPase (see later). Ca2+binding to calmodu-\nlin exhib\nits strong positive cooperativity, enabling calmodulin\nto act as a Ca2+-sensitive molecular trigger. When Ca2+levels\nfall, \nthe balance of activity between myosin light-chain kinases\nand phosphatases shifts in favor of the latter, leading to the\ndephosphorylation of regulatory light chains, the detachment\nof myosin S-1 domains from actin, and muscle relaxation.\nRho kinase provides a Ca2+-independent pathway for ini-\ntiating \ncontraction. Rho kinase phosphorylates myosin\u2019s regu-\nlatory light chains, as well as phosphorylating the phosphatase\nthat dephosphorylates the light chains. Since phosphorylation\nof the phosphatase inhibits its activity, this further shifts the1\n2LMM\nS-2 S-1\n3Thick filament\nThin filament\nFIGURE 51\u20136 Representation of the active cross-bridges\nbetween \nthick and thin filaments. HE Huxley proposed that the\nforce involved in muscular contraction originates in a tendency for\nthe myosin head (S-1) to rotate relative to the thin filament and is\ntransmitted to the thick filament by the S-2 portion of the myosin\nmolecule acting as an inextensible link. Flexible points at each end\nof S-2 permit S-1 to rotate and allow for variations in the separation\nbetween filaments. This figure is based on HE Huxley\u2019s proposal, and\nalso incorporates elastic (the coils in the S-2 portion) and stepwise-\nshortening elements (depicted here as four sites of interaction\nbetween the S-1 portion and the thin filament). The strengths of\nbinding of the attached sites are higher in position 2 than in position\n1 and higher in position 3 than position 2. The myosin head can be\ndetached from position 3 with the utilization of a molecule of ATP;\nthis is the predominant process during shortening.

Phos-\nphorylation of Rho kinase by the cAMP-dependent protein\nkinase may play a role in the dampening effect of this second\nmessenger on smooth muscle contraction.\nCaldesmon (87 kDa), another regulatory protein, is ubiq-\nuitous in smooth muscle and also present in nonmuscle tissue.At low [Ca2+], caldesmon binds to tropomyosin and actin, pre-\nventing the interaction\n of actin with myosin, thereby keeping\nmuscle in a relaxed state. At higher [Ca2+], (Ca2+)4:calmodulin\nbinds \ncaldesmon, releasing it from actin. Now actin is free\nto bind myosin and contraction can occur.

This low resting concentration is maintained by\nthe basal activity of the Ca2+A TPase ( Figure 51\u20138 ), a Ca2+-\nactivated \ncalcium pump that uses the energy of hydrolysis of\nATP to move calcium ions from regions of low to high concen-\ntration.

Dantrolene is a skeletal\nmuscle relaxant that acts to inhibit release of Ca2+from the SR\ninto the cytosol.\nThe causes of MH in humans may involve mutations in\nthe genes encoding the Ca2+release channel, calsequestrin-1,\nthe dihydropyridine receptor, or in the RYR receptor that\nfoster high cytosolic Ca2+levels. Mutations in the RYR1 gene\nare also associated with central core disease . This is a rare\nmyopathy presenting in infancy with hypotonia and proxi-\nmal muscle weakness. Electron microscopy reveals an absence\nof mitochondria in the center of many type I muscle fibers.\nDamage to mitochondria induced by high intracellular levels\nof Ca2+secondary to abnormal functioning of RYR1 appears to\nbe responsible for the morphologic findings.\nCARDIAC MUSCLE RESEMBLES\nSKELET\nAL MUSCLE IN MANY\nRESPECTS\nRegulation of Contraction in Cardiac\nMuscle \nIs Also Actin-Based\nCardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is stri ated. It also is\nregulated by a similar actin-myosin-tropomyosin-troponin\nsystem. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle exhibits\nintrinsic rhythmicity , and individual myocytes commu-\nnicate with each other because of its syncytial nature. The\nT-tubular system (see later) is more developed in cardiac\nmuscle, whereas the SR is less extensive and consequently the\nintracellular supply of Ca2+for contraction is lower. Cardiac\nmuscle thus relies on extracellular Ca2+for contraction; if\nisolated cardiac muscle is deprived of Ca2+, it ceases to beat\nwith\nin approximately 1 minute, whereas skeletal muscle can\ncontinue to contract without an extracellular source of Ca2+\nfor \na longer period. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays a more prom-\ninent role in cardiac muscle than it does in skeletal muscle.\ncAMP modulates intracellular levels of Ca2+throu gh the\nactivation of the protein kinases that phosphorylate various\ntransport proteins in the sarcolemma and SR. The protein\nkinases also target the troponin-tropomyosin regulatory\ncomplex, affecting its responsiveness to intracellular Ca2+.\nThere\n is a rough correlation between the phosphorylation of\nTpI and the increased contraction of cardiac muscle induced\nby catecholamines. This may account for the inotropic\neffects (increased contractility) of \u03b2-adrenergic compounds\non the heart. Some differences among skeletal, cardiac, and\nsmooth muscle are summarized in Table 51\u20132 .\nCa2+Enters Cardiomyocytes via Ca2+\nChannels \n& Leaves via the Na+-Ca2+\nExchanger \n& the Ca2+A TPase\nExtracellular Ca2+ent ers cardiomyocytes via highly selec-\ntive channels.

Consequently,\nmuscle cells have developed multiple mechanisms to regener-\nate the ATP needed to sustain the contraction-relaxation cycle:\n(1) by glycolysis, using blood glucose or muscle glycogen,(2) by oxidative phosphorylation, (3) from creatine phosphate,\nand (4) from two molecules of ADP in a reaction catalyzed by\nadenylyl kinase ( Figure 51\u201310 ).\nSkeletal Muscle Contains Large\nQuantities \nof Glycogen\nThe sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle contains large stores of gly-\ncogen , \nlocated in granules close to the I bands. The release\nof glucose from glycogen is dependent on a specific muscle\nglycogen phosphorylase (see Chapter 18), which can be acti-\nvated by Ca2+, epinephrine, and AMP .

The equilibrium constant for this\nreaction is near 1. Hence, when ATP levels are high, formation\nof creatine phosphate is favored. However, when ATP levels\ndrop, the equilibrium shifts in favor of ATP synthesis at the\nexpense of stored creatine phosphate.

For the sake of simplicity, we shall consider only\ntwo types: type I (slow twitch, oxidative) and type II (fast\ntwitch, glycolytic). The type I fibers contain myoglobin and\nmitochondria; their metabolism is aerobic, and they maintain\nrelatively sustained contractions. The white type II fibers lack\nmyoglobin and contain few mitochondria: they derive their\nenergy from anaerobic glycolysis and perform contractions of\nrelatively short duration.\nThe proportion of these two types of fibers varies among\nthe muscles of the body, depending on function and training.\nFor example, the number of type I fibers in certain leg mus-\ncles increases in athletes training for marathons, whereas the\nnumber of type II fibers increases in sprinters. Type I fibers\nrely heavily on aerobic metabolism to regenerate ATP , while\ntype II fibers rely on oxygen-independent sources such as cre-\natine phosphate. For this reason, many endurance athletes will\nengage in carbohydrate loading, the ingestion of meals that\npredominantly consist of foods with a high starch content,\nin an effort to increase the size of their glycogen stores, while\nsome sprinters will attempt to increase the pool of creatine\nphosphate in their muscles by ingesting creatine as a dietary\nsupplement.MUSCLE TISSUES ARE THE\nT\nARGET OF SEVERAL GENETIC\nDISORDERS\nInherited Cardiomyopathies Can Arise\nFrom \nDisorders of Cardiac Energy\nMetabolism or Abnormal Myocardial\nProteins\nAcardiomyo pathy is any structural or functional abnormality\nof the ventricular myocardium. These abnormalities can arise\nfrom a number of causes, many of them hereditary. As shown\ninTable 51\u20134 , the causes of inherited cardiomyopathies fall\ninto two broad classes: (1) disorders of cardiac energy metabo-\nlism, mainly reflecting mutations in genes encoding enzymes\nor proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation (a major source of\nenergy for the myocardium) and oxidative phosphorylation;\n(2) mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in or affect-\ning myocardial contraction, such as myosin, tropomyosin, the\ntroponins, and cardiac myosin-binding protein C.\nMutations in the Cardiac \u03b2-Myosin\nHeavy-Chain \nGene Are One Cause of\nFamilial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\nFamilial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most\ncommonly \nencountered hereditary cardiac diseases.

This in part reflects\ngenetic heterogeneity as it appears that mutations in a number\nof other genes (eg, those encoding cardiac actin, tropomyosin,\ncardiac troponins I and T, essential and regulatory myosin light\nchains, cardiac myosin-binding protein C, titin, and mitochon-\ndrial tRNA-glycine and tRNA-isoleucine) may also cause familial\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Among these proteins, dystrophin is of\nparticular biomedical interest. Mutations in the gene that\nencodes it play a causative role in Duchenne muscular dys-\ntrophy andBecker muscular dystrophy and have been impli-\ncated in dilated cardiomyopathy (see earlier). Dystrophin\nbridges the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix at\nthe interior face of the plasma membrane. Formation of this\nlink is necessary for assembly of the synaptic junction. Duch-\nenne muscular dystrophy appears to result from the inability\nof mutationally altered forms of dystrophin to support for-\nmation of functionally competent synaptic junctions.

The dystroglycan complex consists of \u03b1-dystroglycan, which\nassociates with the basal lamina protein merosin (also named laminin-2, see Chapter 50), and \u03b1-dystroglycan, which binds \u03b1-dystroglycan and\ndystrophin. Syntrophin binds to the carboxyl terminal of dystrophin. The sarcoglycan complex consists of four transmembrane proteins: \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-,\nand \u03b4-sarcoglycan. The function of the sarcoglycan complex and the nature of the interactions within the complex and between it and the other\ncomplexes are not clear. The sarcoglycan complex is formed only in striated muscle, and its subunits preferentially associate with each other,\nsuggesting that the complex may function as a single unit. Mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin cause Duchenne and Becker muscular\ndystrophies. Mutations in the genes encoding the various sarcoglycans have been shown to be responsible for limb-girdle dystrophies (eg,\nOMIM 604286) and mutations in genes encoding other muscle proteins cause other types of muscular dystrophy. Mutations in genes encoding\ncertain glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the glycan chains of \u03b1-dystroglycan are responsible for certain congenital muscular\ndystrophies.

Under\nphysiologic conditions, G-actin monomers spontaneously\npolymerize to form double helical F-actin filaments (7-9.5 nm\nin diameter), similar to those found in muscle. The actin\nmicrofilaments of the cytoskeleton generally exist as bundles\nwithin a tangled-appearing meshwork.

Assembly starts with the forma-\ntion of tubulin dimers that assemble into protofilaments that\nassociate with one another in parallel to form sheets and even-\ntually cylinders. GTP is required for assembly. A microtubule-\norganizing center, located around a pair of centrioles, nucleates\nthe growth of new microtubules. A third species of tubulin,\n\u03b3-tubulin , appears to play an important role in this process.\nMicrotubules are necessary for mitotic spindle forma-\ntion and function. The latter include chromosome segrega-\ntion during cell division, intracellular movement of endocytic\nand exocytic vesicles, and structural components of cilia and\nflagella . Microtubules also maintain the structure of axons\nanddendrites as well as participate in the axoplasmic flow of\nmaterial along neuronal processes. A variety of microtubule-\nassociated proteins [MAPs] , one of which is tau,play impor-\ntant roles in microtubule assembly and stabilization.\nMicrotubules exist in a state of dynamic instability, con-\nstantly assembling and disassembling. They exhibit polarity\n(plus and minus ends); a feature important for growth from\ncentrioles and directing intracellular movement. For instance,\nin axonal transport, the protein kinesin , with a myosin-like\nATPase activity, uses hydrolysis of ATP to move vesicles down\nthe axon toward the positive end of the microtubular formation.\nFlow of materials in the opposite direction, toward the nega-\ntive end, is powered by cytosolic dynein , another protein with\nATPase activity. Similarly, axonemal dyneins power ciliary and\nflagellar movement while dynamin , which uses GTP instead of\nATP , is involved in endocytosis. Kinesins, dyneins, dynamin, and\nmyosins are referred to as molecular motors .\nAn absence of dynein in cilia and flagella results in immo-\ntile cilia and flagella, leads to Kartagener syndrome (OMIM\n244400), which can cause male sterility, situs inversus, and\nchronic respiratory infections. Mutations in genes affecting the\nsynthesis of dynein have been detected in individuals with this\nsyndrome. Pharmaceuticals such as colchicine (used for treat-\nment of acute gouty arthritis), vinblastine (a vinca alkaloid usedfor treating certain types of cancer), paclitaxel (Taxol) (effective\nagainst ovarian cancer), and griseofulvin (an antifungal agent)\nalso disrupt microtubule assembly or disassembly.\nIntermediate Filaments Differ From\nMicrofilaments \n& Microtubules\nAn intracellular fibrous system exists comprised of filaments\nwi\nth an axial periodicity of 21 nm and a diameter of 8 to 10 nm\nthat is intermediate between that of microfilaments (6 nm) and\nmicrotubules (23 nm).

These sub-\nunits assemble in a helical a manner to form repeating tetra-\nmeric units to form rope-like fibrils. Intermediate filaments are\nimportant structural components of cells that serve as relatively\nstable components of the cytoskeleton. Intermediate filaments\nare not undergoing rapid assembly and disassembly and not\ndisappearing during mitosis, as do actin and many microtubu-\nlar filaments. An important exception to this are the lamins ,\nwhich, subsequent to phosphorylation, disassemble at mitosis\nand reappear when it terminates. Lamins form a meshwork\npositioned in apposition to the inner nuclear membrane. In\naddition, lamin A is an important component of the structural\nscaffolding that maintains the integrity of the cell nucleus.\nHutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome ( progeria , OMIM\n176670) is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene that encodes\nlamin A and, via alternative splicing (see Chapter 36), lamin C .\nIn progeria, a farnesylated form (see Figure 26\u20132 for the structure\nof farnesyl) of prelamin A accumulates in this condition, because\nthe site at which the farnesylated portion of lamin A is normally\ncleaved by proteases has been altered by mutation. It appears that\nthe accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A destabilizes nuclei,\naltering their shape, somehow predisposing victims to manifest\nsigns of premature aging . Experiments in mice have indicated\nthat administration of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor may amelio-\nrate the development of misshapen nuclei. Children affected by\nthis condition often die in their teens of atherosclerosis.\nKeratins form a large family consisting of about 30 mem-\nbers. As indicated in Table 51\u20135, two major types of keratins\nare found that assemble into heterodimers made up of one\nmember of each class. Vimentins are widely distributed in\nmesodermal cells. Desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and\nperipherin are related to them. All members of the vimentin-\nlike family can copolymerize with each other.\nIntermediate filaments in nerve cells, called neurofilaments,\nare classified as low, medium, and high on the basis of their\nmolecular masses. The distribution of intermediate filaments\nin normal and abnormal (eg, cancer) cells can be studied by the\nuse of immunofluorescent techniques. Pathologists utilize anti-\nbodies against specific intermediate filaments to determine the\norigin of certain dedifferentiated malignant tumors.\nA number of skin diseases , mainly characterized by\nblistering, have been found to be due to mutations in genes\nencoding various keratins . Two of these disorders are epider-\nmolysis bullosa simplex (OMIM 131800) and epidermolytic\npalmoplantar keratoderma (OMIM 144200). The blistering\nfound in these disorders probably reflects a diminished capac-\nity of various layers of the skin to resist mechanical stresses\ndue to abnormalities in the keratin structure.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0The myofibrils of skeletal muscle consist of thick, myosin-\nbased and \nthin, actin-based filaments.\n\u25a0During contraction, these interdigitating filaments slide past\none \nanother with cross-bridges between myosin and actin\ngenerating and sustaining tension.\u25a0Muscle contraction is driven by the cyclic attachment,\nconforma\ntional shift, and detachment of massive numbers of\nmyosin head domains to adjacent actin fibrils.\n\u25a0The hydrolysis of ATP is used to drive movement of the filaments.\nA\nTP binds to myosin heads and is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pib y\nthe ATPase activity of the actomyosin complex.\n\u25a0In striated muscle, the contractile apparatus is held in check by\nthe \ntroponin complex (troponins T, I, and C) until inhibition is\nrelieved by the binding of Ca2+to troponin C.\n\u25a0In smooth muscle, the contractile apparatus is held in check\nby \nthe regulatory light chains in myosin. This block is relieved\nwhen the regulatory light chains are phosphorylated by a\n(Ca2+)4:calmodulin-activated protein kinase, myosin light-chain\nkinase.\n\u25a0In skeletal muscle, the SR regulates distribution of Ca2+to the\nsarcomeres, whereas in cardiac and smooth muscle the inflow of\nCa2+occur s via Ca2+cha nnels in the sarcolemma.\n\u25a0Ca2+not only initiates contraction, it also activates the calcium\nefflux systems that will bring contraction to a close.\n\u25a0Many cases of malignant hyperthermia in humans are due\nto mut\nations in the gene encoding the Ca2+rele ase channel\n(RYR1).\n\u25a0Some cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are due to\nmissense m\nutations in the gene coding for the \u03b2-myosin heavy\nchain.

Albumins facilitate the transit\nof fatty acids, steroid hormones, and other ligands between\ntissues, while transferrin aids the uptake and distribution\nof iron. Circulating fibrinogen serves as a readily mobilized\nbuilding block of the fibrin mesh that provides the founda-\ntion of the clots used to seal injured vessels. Formation of these\nclots is triggered by a cascade of latent proteases, or zymogens ,\ncalled blood coagulation factors. Plasma also contains several\nproteins that function as inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes.\nAntithrombin helps confine the formation of clots to the vicin-\nity of a wound, while \u03b11-antiproteinase and \u03b12-macroglobulin\nshield \nhealthy tissues from the proteases that destroy invad-\ning pathogens and remove dead or defective cells. Circulating\nimmunoglobulins called antibodies form the front line of the\nbody\u2019s immune system.Perturbances in the production of plasma proteins can have\nserious health consequences. Deficiencies in key components\nof the blood clotting cascade can result in excessive bruising\nand bleeding ( hemophilia ).

These myriad functions are\ncarried out by a diverse set of components that include cellular\nentities such as red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes (see\nChapters 53 and 54), and the water, electrolytes, metabolites,\nnutrients, proteins, and hormones that comprise the plasma .\nPLASMA CONTAINS A COMPLEX\nMIXTURE \nOF PROTEINS\nEarly scientists classified the proteins found in plasma into\nthree \ngroups, fibrinogen ,albumin , and globulins , on the basis\nof their relative solubility in solutions to which water-miscible\norganic solvents such as ethanol or salting out agents such asammonium sulfate had been added. Using electrophoresis in a\ncellulose acetate matrix, clinical scientists subsequently were\nable to separate the salt-soluble serum protein fraction into\nfive major components designated albumin and the \u03b11-, \u03b12-,\n\u03b2-, \nand \u03b3- globulins (Figure 52\u20131 ). Plasma proteins tend to be\nrich in disulfide bonds and frequently contain bound carbo-\nhydrate ( glycoproteins ) or lipid ( lipoproteins ). The relative\ndimensions and molecular masses of several plasma proteins\nare shown in Figure 52\u20132 .\nPlasma Proteins Help Determine\nthe \nDistribution of Fluid Between\nBlood & Tissues\nThe aggregate concentration of the proteins present in human\nplas\nma typically falls in the range of 7 to 7.5 g/dL. The resulting\nosmotic pressure (oncotic pressure) is approximately 25 mm\nHg. Since the hydrostatic pressure in the arterioles is approxi-\nmately 37 mm Hg, with an interstitial (tissue) pressure of 1 mm\nHg opposing it, a net outward force of about 11 mm Hg drives\nfluid from the plasma into the interstitial spaces. By contrast,\nthe hydrostatic pressure in venules is about 17 mm Hg; thus,\na net force of about 9 mm Hg drives water from tissues back\ninto the circulation. The earlier pressures are often referred to as\nStarling forces . If the concentration of plasma proteins is mark-\nedly diminished (eg, due to severe protein malnutrition), fluid\nwill cease flowing back into the intravascular compartment\nand begin to accumulate in the extravascular tissue spaces,\na condition known as edema .\nMost Plasma Proteins Are Synthesized\nin \nthe Liver\nRoughly 70 to 80% of all plasma proteins are synthesized\nin\n the liver. These include albumin, fibrinogen, transfer-\nrin, and most components of the complement and blood"

Two prominent exceptions are von\nWill\nebrand factor, which is synthesized in the vascular\nendothelium, and the \u03b3-globulins, which are synthesized\nin the lymphocytes. Most plasma proteins are covalently\nmodified by the addition of either N- or O-linked oligo-\nsaccharide chains, or both (see Chapter 46). Albumin is\nthe major exception. These oligosaccharide chains fulfill avariety of functions (see Table 46\u20132). Loss of terminal sialic\nacid residues accelerates clearance of plasma glycoproteins\nfrom the circulation.\nAs is the case for other proteins destined for secre-\ntion from a cell, the genes for plasma proteins code for an\namino-terminal signal sequence that targets them to the\nendoplasmic reticulum. As this leader sequence emerges\nfrom the ribosome, it binds to a transmembrane protein\ncomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum called the signal rec-\nognition particle . The emerging polypeptide chain is pulled\nthrough the signal recognition particle into the lumen of\nthe endoplasmic reticulum and its leader sequence cleaved\noff by an associated signal peptidase (see Chapter 49). The\nnewly synthesized proteins then move from the rough endo-\nplasmic membrane via the smooth endoplasmic membrane\nand Golgi apparatus intro secretory vesicles, during which\ntime they are subject to various posttranslational modifi-\ncations (proteolysis, glycosylation, phosphorylation, etc).\nUltimately, the mature proteins are released via the secretory\nvesicles into the plasma.\nMany Plasma Proteins Exhibit\nPolymorphism\nApol ymorphism is a mendelian or monogenic trait that\nexists in the population in two or more phenotypes, nei-\nther of which is rare (ie, it occurs with frequency of at least\n1-2%).

Clearance permits the\ncontinuous replacement of older, possibly damaged, protein\nmolecules by newly-synthesized ones, a process called turn-\nover. During normal turnover, the total concentration of these\nproteins will remain constant as the countervailing processes\nof synthesis and clearance reach a steady state .\nIn certain diseases, the half-life of a protein may be mark-\nedly altered. For instance, in some gastrointestinal diseases\nsuch as regional ileitis (Crohn disease), considerable amounts\nof plasma proteins, including albumin, may be lost into the\nbowel through the inflamed intestinal mucosa. The half-life\nof albumin in these subjects may be reduced from its normal\n20 days to as little as 1 day, a condition referred to as a protein-\nlosing gastroenteropathy .\nALBUMIN IS THE MOST\nABUNDANT \nPROTEIN IN\nHUMAN PLASMA\nThe liver synthesizes approximately 12 g of albumin per day,\nrepr\nesenting about 25% of total hepatic protein synthesis\nand half its secreted protein. About 40% of the body\u2019s albu-\nmin circulates in the plasma, where it accounts for roughly\nthree-fifths of total plasma protein by weight (3.4-4.7 g/dL).\nThe remainder resides in the extracellular space. Because\nof its relatively high concentration, albumin is thought to\ncontribute 75 to 80% of the osmotic pressure of human\nplasma. Like most other secreted proteins, albumin is ini-\ntially synthesized as a preproprotein . Itssignal peptide is\nremoved as it passes into the cisternae of the rough endo-\nplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, a second hexapeptide\nis cleaved from the new N-terminus as it moves along the\nsecretory pathway.\nMature human albumin consists of a single polypeptide\nchain, 585 amino acids in length, that is organized into three\nfunctional domains. Its ellipsoidal conformation is stabilized by\na total of 17 intrachain disulfide bonds. A major role of albumin\nis to bind to and transport numerous ligands . These include\nfree fatty acids (FFA), calcium, certain steroid hormones, bili-\nrubin, copper, and tryptophan.

However, addi-\ntional molecules such as IL-6 also participate.\nThe small proteins that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication\nbetween the components of the immune system, such as inter-\nferons, ILs, and tumor necrosis factors, are called cytokines .\nCytokines can be both autocrine and paracrine in nature. One of\nthe primary targets of IL-1 and IL-6 is nuclear factor kappa-B\n(NF\u03baB) , a transcription factor that regulates the expression of\nthe genes encoding many cytokines, chemokines, growth fac-\ntors, and cell adhesion molecules. NF\u03baB, a heterodimer com-\nprised of a 50- and a 65-kDa polypeptide, normally resides in\nthe cytosol as an inactive complex with a second protein, NF\u03baB\ninhibitor-\u03b1, also known as I\u03baB\u03b1 .

Senescent or damaged erythrocytes are\nphagocytosed in the spleen and liver by macrophages of the\nreticuloendothelial system (RES). Within these macrophages,\nhemoglobin-derived heme groups are oxidized to biliverdin\nby the enzyme heme oxygenase (see Figure 31\u201313), releas-\ning carbon monoxide and iron. The liberated iron is exported\nfrom phagocytic vesicles in the macrophage by NRAMP 1\n(natural resistance\u2013associated macrophage protein 1), a trans-\nporter homologous to DMT1. Iron is subsequently secreted\ninto the circulation by the transmembrane protein ferroportin\n(Figure 52\u20133 ). Thus, ferroportin plays a central role in both iron\nabsorption by the intestine and iron secretion from macrophages.\nIn the blood, Fe2+is oxidized to Fe3+in a reaction cata-\nlyzed by the ferrioxidase ceruloplasmin (see later), a copper-\ncontaining plasma enzyme synthesized by liver. Once oxidized,\nFe3+is then bound by transferrin in blood. The iron released\nfrom macrophages in this way (about 25 mg/d) is recycled,\nthereby reducing the need for intestinal iron absorption, which\naverages only 1 to 2 mg/d.Haptoglobin Scavenges Hemoglobin\nThat \nHas Escaped Recycling\nDuring the course of red blood cell turnover, approximately\n10% \nof an erythrocyte\u2019s hemoglobin escapes into the circula-\ntion. This free, extracorpuscular hemoglobin is sufficiently\nsmall at \u224865 kDa to pass through the glomerulus of the kidney\ninto the tubules, where it tends to form damaging precipitates.\nHaptoglobin (Hp) is a plasma glycoprotein that binds extra-\ncorpuscular hemoglobin (Hb), forming a tight noncovalent\ncomplex (Hb-Hp). The large size of the resulting Hb-Hp com-\nplex (\u2265 155 kDa) prevents its passage through the glomerulus,\nthereby protecting the kidney from the formation of harmful\nprecipitates and reducing the loss of the iron associated with\nextracorpuscular hemoglobin.

Any excess ferritin-bound\niron remaining in the enterocytes is disposed of when they are\nsloughed off into the gut lumen.\nFerritin Can Bind Thousands of\nFe3+Atoms\nThe human body can typically store up to 1 g of iron, the vast\nmajori\nty of which is bound to ferritin . Ferritin (MW 440 kDa)\nforms a hollow ball composed of two-dozen \u224819 to 21 kDa\npolypeptide subunits that can encapsulate as many as 3000 to\n4500 ferric atoms. Ferritin subunits may be of the H (heavy)\nor the L (light) type. The H-subunit possesses ferroxidase\nactivity, which is required for iron-loading of ferritin. The\nL-subunit is proposed to play a role in ferritin nucleation and\nstabilization. Normally, a small amount of ferritin is present\nin human plasma (50-200 \u03bcg/dL) proportionate to the total\nstores of iron in the body. While it is not known whether the\nferritin in plasma is derived from damaged cells or secretion\nfrom healthy ones, plasma ferritin levels provide a useful indi-\ncator of body iron stores. Hemosiderin , a partly degraded\nform of ferritin, also may appear in tissues under conditions\nof iron overload ( hemosiderosis ).\nTransferrin Shuttles Iron to Where\nIt \nIs Needed\nThe toxicity of free iron is largely a consequence of its ability\nto induce \nthe formation of damaging reactive oxygen species\n(Figure 52\u20135 ). Living organisms protect themselves against\niron\u2019s potential toxicity by employing specialized storage and\ntransport proteins, and transporting iron in its less reactive,\nFe3+, state. In humans, Fe3+is tran sported through the circula-\ntion bound to transferrin (Tf) , a glycoprotein synthesized by\nthe liver. This \u03b21-globulin has a molecular mass of approxi-\nmate\nly 76 kDa and contains two high-affinity binding sites\nfor Fe3+. Glycosylation of transferrin is impaired in congeni-\ntal disorders of glycosylation (see Chapter 46) or in chronic\nalcoholism, \na condition for which the presence of carbohy-\ndrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is sometimes used as a\nbiomarker.\nThe concentration of Tf in plasma is approximately\n300 mg/dL, sufficient to carry a total of approximately 300 \u03bcg\nof iron per deciliter of plasma, which represents the total iron-\nbinding capacity (TIBC) of plasma. Typically, about 30% of\nthe iron-binding sites in transferrin are occupied. Occupancy\nFe2++ H2O2 Fe3++ OH\u2022+ OH\u2013\nFIGURE 52\u20135 The Fenton reaction.

The receptor-transferrin com-\nplex is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis\n(see Chapter 25) into late endosomes. The bound iron is then\nreleased as late endosomes become acidified and is trans-\nported to the cytoplasm by DMT1. Still bound to the transfer-\nrin receptor, the iron-free or apotransferrin receptor (apoTf)\nis returned by the endosome to the cell surface, where it dis-\nsociates from the receptor and reenters the plasma ready to\nbind more iron. This recycling process is called the transfer-\nrin cycle (Figure 52\u20136 ).\nWhile TfR1 is found on the surface of most cells, the\nhomologous transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is encountered\nprimarily on the surface of hepatocytes and the crypt cells of\nthe small intestine. The affinity of TfR2 for transferrin is much\nlower than that of TfR1, optimizing the former as a sensor,\nrather than an importer, for iron.\nOxidation by Ceruloplasmin Is a\nKey \nFeature of the Iron Cycle\nMacrophages play a key role in the turnover of red blood cells.\nFollo\nwing phagocytosis and digestion via lysosomal hydro-\nlases, the free iron is expelled largely in the ferrous, Fe2+, state.\nIn \norder to be recovered via the transferrin cycle, this iron\nmust be oxidized to the ferric, Fe3+, state by the ferroxidase\nceruloplasmin , \na 160-kDa \u03b12-globulin synthesized in the liver.\nCerru\nloplasm carries out this oxidation using six, catalytically\nessential, copper atoms whose presence renders it the major\ncopper-containing protein in plasma.\nDeficiencies in Ceruloplasmin\nPerturb \nIron Homeostasis\nCeruloplasmin deficiency can arise from genetic causes as\nwell \nas a lack of dietary copper, an essential micronutrient.\nWhen adequate quantities of catalytically functional cerulo-\nplasmin are lacking, the body\u2019s ability to recycle Fe2+becomes\nimpair\ned, leading to iron accumulation in tissues. While per-\nsons suffering from hypoceruloplasmenia , a genetically heri-\ntable condition in which ceruloplasmin levels are roughly 50%\nof normal, generally display no clinical abnormalities, genetic\nmutations that abolish the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplas-\nmin, aceruloplasminemia , can have severe physiologic con-\nsequences. If left untreated, the progressive accumulation of\niron in pancreatic islet cells and basal ganglia eventually leads\nto the development of insulin-dependent diabetes and neuro-\nlogic degeneration that may manifest as dementia, dysarthria,\nand dystonia."

At high concentrations of\niron, the iron bound to the IRP prevents that protein from binding\nthe IREs on either type of mRNA. The mRNA for ferritin is able to be\ntranslated under these circumstances, and ferritin is synthesized. On\nthe other hand, when the IRP is not able to bind to the IRE on the\nmRNA for TfR1, that mRNA is degraded. In contrast, at low concen-\ntrations of iron the IRP is able to bind to the IREs on both types of\nmRNA. In the case of the ferritin mRNA, this prevents it from being\ntranslated. Hence ferritin is not synthesized. In the case of the mRNA\nfor TfR1, binding of the IRP prevents that mRNA from being degraded,\nenabling it to be translated and TfR1 to be synthesized.

When iron is\nabundant and TfFe levels are high, the latter displaces HFE\nfrom TfR1. The displaced HFE protein then binds to TfR2,\nforming a complex that can be further stabilized by associa-\ntion with Tf-Fe. Formation of the HFE-TfR2 complex triggers\nan intracellular signaling cascade that activates expression of\nHAMP , the gene encoding hepcidin. It has been observed\nthat mutations in the gene encoding HFE protein are com-\nmonly encountered in persons suffering from hereditary\nhemochromatosis.\nBone Morphogenetic Proteins\nInfluence \nHepcidin Expression\nWhile bo ne morphogenic proteins (BMPs) act by mecha-\nnisms that are distinct from HFE protein, considerable\ncross-talk occurs between these pathways. For example,\nthe binding affinity of the cell surface receptor for BMP\n(BMPR) is augmented when BMPR is associated with\nthe coreceptor, hemojuvelin (HJV). The activation of the\nBMPR-HJV complex triggers the phosphorylation of intra-\ncellular signaling proteins called SMADs , which stimu-\nlates the transcription of the gene that codes for hepcidin\n(see Figure 52\u20139).\nInflammatory & Erythropoietic Signals\nRegulate \nHepcidin Levels\nDuring an inflammatory response, synthesis of hepcidin is\ninduced \nby small secreted proteins called cytokines.

Major causes of\niron insufficiency include dietary deficiency, malabsorp-\ntion, gastrointestinal bleeding, and episodic blood loss such\nas from menstruation. Persistent iron deficiency can lead to\nthe progressive depletion of bodily iron stores. If the level\nof transferrin saturation falls to 20% or below, hemoglo-\nbin synthesis will be impaired, resulting in iron-deficient\nerythropoiesis . Over time hemoglobin levels in blood will\ngradually fall, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia , which\nmanifests as a hypochromic, microcytic blood picture\nthat is accompanied by fatigue, pallor, and reduced exercise\ncapacity.\nDuring iron deficient anemia, erythrocytes exhibit\nincreased levels of surface transferrin receptor-1 as well as\ndeficits in the ferrochelatase-catalyzed incorporation of iron\ninto protoporphyrin IX. Partial proteolysis of cell surface\ntransferrin receptors releases increased quantities of soluble\ntransferrin receptor (sTfR) protein into the plasma. This\nincrease, along with the accumulation of red-cell protopor-\nphyrin, serve as diagnostic biomarkers for iron deficiency\nanemia since chronic inflammation does not affect the level of\nerythrocyte transferrin receptors, and hence sTfR. Table 52\u20135lists several clinical biomarkers utilized to detect and monitor\nthe progression of iron deficiency anemia.\nHereditary Hemochromatosis Is\nCharacterized \nby Iron Overload\nHemochromatosis or iron overload, is characterized by hemi-\nsoderosis, the accumulation of stainable concentrations of iron\nin tissues. Hereditary hyperabsorption of iron by the intestines\ncan be caused by mutations in the gene encoding homeostatic\niron regulator protein ( HFE) or, less frequently, hepcidin, TfR2,\nHJV , or ferroportin ( Table 52\u20136 ). Secondary iron overload is\nusually associated with ineffective erythropoiesis, as seen in the\nthalassemia syndromes.\nSERUM INHIBITORS PREVENT\nINDISCRIMINA\nTE PROTEOLYSIS\nProteases are essential participants in tissue remodeling, blood\nclotting, \nelimination of old or diseased cells, destruction of\ninvading pathogens, and other physiologic functions. Left\nunchecked, however, proteolytic enzymes released into the\nblood by secretion or tissue damage can harm healthy tissue.\nProtection from indiscriminate proteolysis involves a battery\nof serum proteins that inhibit, and thereby limit the scope of,\nprotease action.Senescent\nerythrocyte\nphagocyt\nosed by\nthe macrophage\nMacrophage\nHepcidin\nBloodFe2+Fe2+\nFe2+Fe2+Fe3+\nDuodenal\ncytochrome b\n(Dcytb)\nEnter\nocyteIntestinal lumen\nFe2+Hemoglobin\nHemeFerr\noportin\nFerroportinDivalent metal\ntransporter1 (DMT 1)\nBiliverdin  Bilirubin\nInternalization and\ndegradation of\nferroportin bound\nto hepcidinInternalization and\ndegradation of\nferroportin bound\nto hepcidin\nHephaestin\nFe2+Fe2+Fe3+\nFIGURE 52\u20138 Role of hepcidin in systemic iron regulation.

They generally also contain a P component\nderived from a C-reactive protein-like protein called serum\namyloid P component.\nStructural abnormalities or overproduction of more than\n20 different proteins have been implicated in various types\nof amyloidosis. Primary amyloidosis ( Table 52\u20137 ) typically\nis caused by a monoclonal plasma cell disorder that leads to\nthe accumulation of protein fragments derived from immu-\nnoglobulin light chains (see later). Secondary amyloidosis\nresults from an accumulation of fragments of serum amy-\nloid A (SAA) associated with chronic infections or cancer.\nIn these instances, elevated levels of inflammatory cyto-\nkines stimulate the liver to synthesize SAA, which leads to\na concomitant rise in its proteolytic degradation products.\nFamilial amyloidosis results from accumulation of mutated\nforms of certain plasma proteins such as transthyretin (see\nTable 52\u20133). Over 80 mutationally altered forms of this\nprotein have been identified. In addition, because patients\nundergoing long-term hemodialysis are unable to clear \u03b22-\nmic\nroglobulin , which is retained by dialysis membranes,\nthey are at greater risk of amyloidosis as the levels of this\nplasma protein increase in the blood.\nPLASMA IMMUNOGLOBULINS\nDEFEND \nAGAINST INVADERS\nThe major humoral components of the body\u2019s immune system\ninclude B \nlymphocytes (B cells), T lymphocytes (T cells) , and\nthe innate immune system .

The latter include defense against\nmalignant cells and many viruses as well as hypersensitivity\nreactions and graft rejection. B and T cells respond in an adap-\ntivemanner, developing a targeted response for each invader\nencountered. The innate immune system defends against\ninfection in a nonspecific manner. It contains a variety of cells\nsuch as phagocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and others\nthat will be discussed in Chapter 54.\nImmunoglobulins Are Comprised of\nMultiple \nPolypeptide Chains\nImmunoglobulins are oligomeric glycoproteins composed of\nheavy (H) \nor light (L) chains, designations based on their rate\nof migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nHuman immunoglobulins can be grouped into five classes\nabbreviated as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM ( Table 52\u20138 ).\nThe most abundant of the five, IgG, consists of two identical\nlight chains (23 kDa) linked together by a network of disul-\nfide bonds to each other as well as two identical heavy chains\n(53-75 kDa). The respective biologic functions of each class\nare summarized in Table 52\u20139.\nEach class of immunoglobulin contains a different H chain\nisoform: \u03b1 (IgA), \u03b4 (IgD), \u03b5 (IgE), \u03b3 (IgG), and \u03bc (IgM). The\n\u03b3-type H chains of IgG are organized into an amino-terminal\nvariable region (VH) and three constant regions (CH1, CH2,\nCH3). The \u03bc and \u03b5chains each have four CHdomain s rather\nthan the usual three. Some immunoglobulins such as IgG exist\nonly as the basic tetramer, with the various chains arranged\nin the Y-shaped configuration shown in Figure 52-11 . Others\nsuch as IgA and IgM can form higher oligomers comprised of\ntwo, three (IgA), or five (IgM) copies of the core tetrameric\nunit ( Figure 52\u201312 ).\nThe IgG light chain can be subdivided into a C-terminal\nconstant region (CL)and amino-terminal variable region\n(VL). There are two general types of light chains, kappa (\u03ba)and\nlambda ( \u03bb), which differ in the structure of their CLregions. A\ngiven immunoglobulin molecule always contains either two \u03ba\nor two \u03bb light chains\u2014never a mixture of a \u03ba and a \u03bb, with the\nformer predominating in humans.\nEach IgG molecule binds to its target molecules, or anti-\ngens, at a specific site, or epitope (sometimes called an antigenic\ndeterminant). Typical epitopes may consist of a short polysac-\ncharide or amino acid sequence, or a specific three-dimensional\narrangement of amino acids or sugars drawn from disparate\nparts of the antigen\u2019s primary sequence. Each IgG molecule\ncontains two identical antigen binding sites, which are located\nnear the tips of the Y, making this immunoglobulin bivalent\u2014\nable to bind two antigen molecules simultaneously. These antigen\nbinding sites are comprised of VHand VLdomain s arranged\ntogether as two antiparallel sheets.\nBecause the region between the CH1 and CH2 domains can\nbe r\neadily cleaved by pepsin or papain (see Figure 52\u201311), it is"

The exceptional binding\naffinity and specificity of immunoglobulins for their target\nantigens derives from the ability of activated B cells to uniquely\nconfigure the hypervariable regions of the immunoglobulin\nlight and heavy chains to complement a specific epitope.\nAntibody Diversity Depends on\nGene \nRearrangements\nThe human genome contains fewer than 150 immunoglobu-\nlin \ngenes. Nevertheless, each person is capable of synthesiz-\ning perhaps 1 million different antibodies, each specific for a\nunique antigen. Clearly, immunoglobulin expression does not\nfollow the \u201cone gene, one protein\u201d paradigm. Instead, immu-\nnoglobulin diversity is generated by combinatorial mecha-\nnisms based on mixing and rearranging a finite pool of genetic\ninformation in multiple ways (see Chapters 35 and 38).\nAntibody diversity arises, in part, from the distribu-\ntion of the coding sequence for each immunoglobulin chain\namong multiple genes. Each light chain is the product of three\nor more separate structural genes that code for the variableregion ( VL), joining region (J) (bearing no relationship to the\nJ chain of IgA or IgM), and constant region ( CL). Similarly,\neach heavy chain is the product of at least four different genes\nthat code for a variable region ( VH), adiversity region ( D), a\njoining region ( J), and a constant region ( CH). Each gene is\npresent in the human genome in several versions that can be\nassembled in a multiplicity of combinations.\nDiversity is further augmented through the action of the\nactivation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). By catalyzing\nthe conversion of cytidine to uracil, AID massively increases\nthe frequency of mutation of immunoglobulin Vgenes. AID-\ngenerated mutations are somatic in nature, unique to the dif-\nferentiated cell where they occurred rather than to a germline\ncell. Consequently, activation of AID can generate unique\nsubpopulations of B cells that harbor distinct mutations of\ntheir Vgenes, causing each to synthesize immunoglobulins\nof differing antigen specificity. In some pathologic states, the\nmutagenic action of AID can lead to the generation of auto-\nantibodies that target the body\u2019s endogenous components, a\nphenomenon termed autoimmunity .\nA third mechanism for synthesizing antibodies that target\nnovel antigens is junctional diversity .

The CH2 domain contains the complement-binding site and the CH3 domain contains a site that attaches to receptors on neutrophils\nand \nmacrophages. The antigen-binding site is formed by the hypervariable regions of both the light and heavy chains, which are located in the\nvariable regions of these chains (see Figure 52\u201313). The light and heavy chains are linked by disulfide bonds, and the heavy chains are also linked\nto each other by disulfide bonds.

Whereas a newly synthesized light chain\nwill initially be mated with a \u03bc chain to generate a specific IgM\nmolecule, over time the same antigen-specific light chain will\nbe mated with a \u03b3 chain to generate an IgG whose VHreg ionand, consequently, antigen specificity will be identical to that\nof the \u03bc chain of the preceding IgM molecule. Combining this\nlight chain with an \u03b1 heavy chain, in turn, forms an IgA mol-\necule with identical antigen specificity.

New York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2001.)immune system derives its na me from the fact that the num-\nber, function, and specificity of its components are fixed and\nremain constant throughout life. The complement system\nforms the humoral arm of the innate immune system. Since it\ncan be activated by exposure to antibody-antigen complexes,\nit can be considered to function as a support for or \u201ccomple-\nment\u201d of the adaptive immune system.\nThe complement system displays features reminiscent of\nthe clot-inducing coagulation cascade. Both consist of sets of\ncirculating zymogens (proproteins) that remain catalytically\ndormant until activated by proteolytic cleavage. These propro-\nteins, called complement factors , are synthesized by a variety\nof cell types that include hepatocytes, macrophages, monocytes,\nand intestinal endothelial cells. As is the case for clotting factors,\nmost complement factors are proproteases (see Chapter 9) that,\non activation, target other components of the system, thereby\ngenerating a series or cascade of proteolytic activation events\nthat produce one or more protective end products (eg, fibrin).\nTheclassical pathway for activating the complex system\nis triggered when an antibody-antigen complex binds to and\nstimulates the protease activity of factor C1. Activated C1 then\ncleaves complement factor C2 to form two smaller proteins,\nC2a and C2b, as well as cleaving complement factor C4 to\nform C4a and C4b ( Figure 52\u201314 ). Two of the proteolytic\nfragments, C2a and C4b, then associate together to form a new\nprotease, the C3 convertase, which cleaves complement factor\nC3 into C3a and C3b. C3a now binds with the C2a:C4b het-\nerodimer to form a heterotrimeric complex, the C5 convertase,\nthat cleaves complement factor C5 into C5a and C5b. The C5b\nprotein then combines with complement factors C6, C7, C8,\nand C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC\nkills bacterial invaders by binding to and opening a pore in their\nplasma membrane. Following lysis, the bacterial remains are\ndestroyed by phagocytic macrophages. Meanwhile, the C3a and\nC5a proteins serve as chemoattractants that recruit leukocytes\nto the site of infection and stimulate an inflammatory response.\nTargeting of the MAC to invading bacteria is facilitated by\nthe presence of thioester bonds in C3 and C4. Like the thioester\nbond in the plasma protease inhibitor \u03b12-macroglobulin, these\nhighly reactive bonds \nbecomes exposed as a result of the con-\nformational change that accompanies proteolytic activation.\nIn the case of C3 and C4, the thioester reacts with the hydroxyl\ngroups of the bacteria\u2019s surface polysaccharides, covalently\nanchoring the C5 convertase complex of which they are a part\nto the targeted pathogen. This enables the remaining compo-\nnents of the MAC to be formed in close proximity to the bacte-\nrial membrane, facilitating assembly.\nActivation can also be triggered via the lectin pathway .\nBacterial polysaccharides bind to a complement factor called\nmannose-binding lectin (MBL) or mannan-binding protein\n(MBP). The lectin-polysaccharide complex then recruits and\nactivates C4 (see Figure 52\u201314). The term lectin refers to any\nprotein that binds polysaccharides. Most lectins are highly selec-\ntive. MBL is specific for the mannose-containing carbohydrate\nmoieties ( mannans ) of glycoproteins and lipopolysaccharides\npresent on the surface of gram-positive bacteria, some viruses,"

The pack-\naging of hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase inside special-\nized cells called erythrocytes greatly amplified the capacity\nof circulating blood to carry oxygen to and carbon dioxide\naway from peripheral tissues. Anemia , a deficiency in the\nlevel of circulating hemoglobin (<120-130 g/L), compro-\nmises health by reducing the ability of the blood to supply\ntissues with adequate levels of oxygen. Anemia can arise\nfrom a variety of causes that include genetic abnormalities\n(eg, sickle cell trait, pernicious anemia), excessive bleed-\ning, insufficiencies of dietary iron or vitamin B12, or the\nlys\nis of red blood cells by invading pathogens (eg, malaria).\nPlatelets help staunch the outflow of blood from damaged\ntissues. Deficits in platelet number or function increase a\npatient\u2019s vulnerability to hemorrhage by reducing the speed\nof formation and structural integrity of protective clots.\nAs is the case for anemia, a low platelet count, known as\nthrombocytopenia , can be triggered by a range of factors\nthat include bacterial infection, some medications including\nsulfa-containing antibiotics, or autoimmune reactions such asidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Other pathophysiologic\nsyndromes, such as von Willebrand disease andGlanzmann\nthrombasthenia , are caused by genetic mutations that impair\nplatelet adherence or aggregation rather than their abundance.\nRED BLOOD CELLS DERIVE FROM\nHEMA\nTOPOIETIC STEM CELLS\nBoth red blood cells and platelets turn over at a relatively high\nrate\n.

Pluripotent stem\ncells can differentiate into cells of any of the three germ layers.\nMultipotent stem cells are restricted to forming cells that\nbelong to a single family or class.

Both factors reduce the distance\ngas molecules must diffuse to and from the rapidly moving\n(up to 2 mm/s) erythrocytes.\nErythrocytes Generate ATP\nExclusiv\nely via Glycolysis\nMature red blood cells lack mitochondria and their contents,\nincludin\ng ATP synthase and the enzymes of the tricarboxylic\nacid cycle (TCA), electron transport chain, and \u03b2-oxidation\npathway. They are therefore incapable of utilizing fatty acids or\nketone bodies as metabolic fuel and therefore are completely\nreliant on glycolysis to generate ATP . Glucose enters red blood\ncells by facilitated diffusion (see Chapter 40), a process medi-\nated by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) , also known as glu-\ncose permease ( Table 53\u20131 ).\nThe glycolytic pathway in red blood cells also possesses\na unique branch, or shunt, whose purpose is to isomerize\n1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to 2,3-bisphosphoglyc-\nerate (2,3-BPG). 2,3-BPG binds to and stabilizes hemoglobin\nin the T-state (see Chapter 6). Conversion of 1,3-BPG to 2,3-\nBPG is catalyzed by 2,3-BPG mutase, a bifunctional enzyme\nthat also catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2,3-BPG to the glycolytic\nintermediate 3-phosphoglycerate. A second enzyme, multiple\ninositol polyphosphate phosphatase, also catalyzes the hydro-\nlysis of 2,3-BPG, in this case to the glycolytic intermediate\n2-phosphoglycerate. The activities of these enzymes are sensi-\ntive to pH, which ensures that 2,3-BPG levels rise and fall at\nthe appropriate times as the red blood cells travel the circula-\ntory system.\nVarious aspects of the metabolism of the red cell, several\nof which are discussed in other chapters, are summarized in\nTable 53\u20132 .Carbonic Anhydrase Facilitates\nCO2T ransport\nEvery molecule of O2co nsumed results in the formation of cor-\nresponding number of CO2mo lecules, which must be disposed.\nLike oxygen, the solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous solution\nis much too low to accommodate more than a few percent of the\nCO2pr oduced by metabolically active tissues. However, the solu-\nbility of the hydrated form of CO2, carbonic acid (H2CO3), and\nit\ns protonic dissociation product, bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212), is rela-\nti\nvely high. The presence of high levels of the enzyme carbonic\nanhydrase (see Figure 6\u201311) enables erythrocytes both to absorb\nwaste CO2b y catalyzing its rapid conversion to carbonic acid,\nand to reverse this process in order to facilitate its expulsion from\nthe lungs.

Ferric iron is\nreduced to the ferrous state by the action of an NADH-dependent\nmethemoglobin reductase system involving cytochrome b5re ductase\nand cytochrome b5.\n\u2022While \nbiosynthesis of glycogen, fatty acids, protein, and nucleic\nacids does not occur in the RBC, some lipids (eg, cholesterol) in the\nred cell membrane can exchange with corresponding plasma lipids.\n\u2022The RBC contains certain enzymes of nucleotide metabolism\n(eg, adenosine deaminase, pyrimidine nucleotidase, and adenylyl\nkinase). Deficiencies of these enzymes are involved in some cases\nof hemolytic anemia.\n\u2022When RBCs reach the end of their lifespan, the globin is degraded\nto amino acids (which are reutilized in the body), the iron is\nreleased from heme and reutilized, and the tetrapyrrole compo-\nnent of heme is converted to bilirubin, which is mainly excreted\ninto the bowel via the bile."

Consequently,\nduring the \u2248 24 hours required to complete maturation to\nerythrocytes, these nascent red blood cells, called reticulocytes ,\nretain the capacity to synthesize polypeptides (eg, globin) under\nthe direction of vestigial mRNA molecules.\nIn rare cases, genetic mutations that lead to an impairment\nof ribosome function, called ribomyopathies , can result in red\nblood cell hypoplasia.

Glycosylation occurs at four sites.\nGlycosylation at two of these sites is essential for physiologic\nfunction. EPO is synthesized mainly by the kidney, which releases\nit into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. On reaching the\nbone marrow, EPO stimulates red blood cell progenitors via a\ntransmembrane receptor. Binding of EPO to its receptor causes\nthe latter to dimerize. The transition to a dimeric state then acti-\nvates associated molecules of the Jak2 protein-tyrosine kinase.\nErythropoietin is administered therapeutically to treat ane-\nmias arising from chronic kidney failure, disorders of hemato-\npoietic stem cells ( myelodysplasia ), or from the collateral effects\nof chemical and radiologic treatments for cancer. Currently,\npharmaceutical EPO is obtained via recombinant expression in\nChinese Hamster Ovary cell lines, which are commonly used to\nproduce therapeutic proteins because of their capacity to closely\nmimic the glycosylation patterns found in their naturally pro-\nduced counterparts. Unfortunately, some recipients of recurring\ndoses of recombinant EPO develop neutralizing antibodies that\nin turn causes the development of pure red blood cell aplasia.\nScientists are working to develop less immunogenic variants of or\nbiomimetic substitutes for current versions of recombinant EPO.\nOXIDATION OF HEME IRON\nC\nOMPROMISES OXYGEN\nTRANSPORT\nCytochrome b5Reductase Reduces\nMethemoglobin\nThe ferrous, Fe2+, iron atoms in hemoglobin are susceptible to\noxid\nation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) . Hemoglobin inwhich one or more heme irons has been oxidized to the ferric\n(Fe3+) state is called methemo globin . Ferric hemes do not bind\noxygen, which not only reduces the number of O2-binding sites,\nbu\nt can interfere with the cooperative interactions between the\nsubunits of the hemoglobin tetramer (see Chapter 6). The ability\nto rescue methemoglobin by reducing ferric iron is thus of great\nphysiologic importance. In red blood cells, methemoglobin\nreduction is catalyzed by the NADH\u2013cytochrome b5methem o-\nglobin reductase system. The first component of the system, a\nflavoprotein named cytochrome b5red uctase (also known as\nmethemoglobin reductase), transfers electrons from NADH to\nthe second component, cytochrome b5:\nCytb5ox+ N ADH \u2192Cytb5red+ N AD+\nReduced cytochrome b5then transfers the electrons to\nmethemoglobin, reducing Fe3+back to the Fe2+state, which\nrestores hemoglobin to its fully functional state:\nHb \u2212 Fe3++ C yt b5red\u2192Hb \u2212 Fe2++ C yt b5ox\nThe ultimate source of the electrons used to reduce met-\nhemoglobin \nis glycolysis, where NAD+is reduced to NADH by\nthe action of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The\nefficiency of this system is such that only trace quantities of\nmethemoglobin are normally present in erythrocytes.\nMethemoglobinemia Is\nInherited \nor Acquired\nMethemoglobinemia , the abnormal accumulation of methe-\nmoglobin, can arise from genetic abnormalities (inherited met-\nhemoglobinemia) or from the ingestion of certain substances\n(acquired methemoglobinemia) such as nitrates, aniline, or\nsulfonamide antibiotics ( Table 53\u20133 ). Affected patients often\nexhibit bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous mem-\nbranes (cyanosis). The inherited form most commonly arises\nfrom a deficiency in the quantity or activity of cytochrome\nb5reductase , although mutations that affect the properties\nof cytochrome b5itsel f have also been encountered. In rare\ninstances, methemoglobinemia can result from mutations in\nhemoglobin itself, such as those affecting the proximal and dis-\ntal histidine residues (see Figure 6\u20133), that render it more sus-\nceptible to oxidation. Collectively referred to as hemoglobin M\n(HbM), these include HbMIwate, in which His87 in the \u03b1 subunit\nis\n replaced by Tyr; HbMHyde Park, in which His92 of the \u03b2 subunit\nis\n replaced by Tyr; HbMBoston, in which His58 in the \u03b1 subunits of\nhe\nmoglobin is replaced by Tyr; and HbMSaskatoon, in which His63\nin \nthe \u03b2 subunit is replaced by Tyr.

Approx-\nimately 3% of the hemoglobin of human blood undergoes\nauto-oxidation each day. In addition, oxidation of the iron\nstorage protein ferritin by superoxide can result in the release\nof free Fe2+and the subsequent iron-catalyzed generation of\nOH\u2022(see Figure 58\u20132). Superoxide may thus produce the tis-\nsue damage that occurs in persons suffering from abnormally\nhigh levels of iron in the body, known as iron overload. Iron\noverload is characteristic of individuals suffering from heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis , a genetic condition that causes the\nbody to absorb excessive quantities of dietary iron. Another\nendogenous source of superoxide is the enzyme NADPH-\nhemoprotein reductase (a cytochrome P450 reductase, see\nChapter 12), which also catalyzes the reduction of the Fe3+in\nmethemoglobin \nto Fe2+.\nDeficiency of Glucose-6-Phosphate\nDehy\ndrogenase Is an Important Cause\nof Hemolytic Anemia\nThe limited suite of metabolic pathways present in red blood\ncells \nrenders them completely reliant on the pentose phosphate\npathway (see Chapter 20) or, to be more specific, the X-linked\nenzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , for the reduc-\ntion of NADP+to NADPH. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase deficiency is the most common of all enzymopathies(diseases caused by abnormalities of enzymes). More than\n400 million people are estimated to carry one of the over 140\ngenetic variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This\ndeficiency is most common among natives of tropical Africa\n(and their African-American descendants), the Mediterra-\nnean, and certain parts of Asia.\nIndividuals harboring this deficiency are vulnerable to\nhemolytic anemia, a consequence of their inability to generate\nsufficient NADPH to maintain glutathione, a key intracellular\nantioxidant, in the reduced state (Figure 53\u20133) . A deficiency\nin glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase renders red blood cells\nhypersensitive to oxidative stress and the formation of Heinz\nbodies , insoluble aggregates consisting of hemoglobin mol-\necules whose \u2014SH groups have become oxidized. Like sickle\ncell trait, the persistence of these genetic variants has been\nattributed to their potential to confer enhanced resistance to\nmalaria.\nHemolytic Anemias Can Be Caused\nby \nExtrinsic, Intrinsic, or Membrane-\nSpecific Factors\nHemolytic anemia can be triggered by factors other than a defi-\nciency in \nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Figure 53\u20134) .\nExtrinsic causes (beyond the erythrocyte membrane) include\nhypersplenism , in which the enlargement of the spleen causes\nred blood cells to become sequestered within this organ.TABLE 53\u20133 Summary of the Causes of Some Important Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells\nDisorder Sole or Major Cause\nIron \ndeficiency anemia Inadequate intake or exerssive loss of iron\nMethemoglobinemia Intake of excess oxidants (various chemicals and drugs)\nGenetic deficiency in the NADH-dependent methemoglobin reductase system (OMIM 250800)\nInheritance of HbM (OMIM 141900)\nSickle cell anemia (OMIM 603903) Sequence of condon 6 of the \u03b2 chain changed from GAG in the normal gene to GTC in the\nsickle cell gene, resulting in substitution of valine for glutamic acid\n\u03b1-Thalassemias (OMIM 141800) Mutations in the \u03b1-globin genes, mainly unequal crossing-over and large deletions and less\ncommonly nonsense and frameshift mutations\n\u03b2-Thalassemias (OMIM 141900) A very wide variety of mutations in the \u03b2-globin gene, including deletions, nonsense and\nframeshift mutations, and others affecting every aspect of its structure (eg, splice sites,\npromoter mutants)\nMegaloblastic anemias Deficiency of vitamin B12.

Immunologic incompatibilities\nmay arise when an Rh+fetus is carried by an Rh\u2212mother\n(Rh \ndisease ) or as a consequence of an autoimmune disor-\nder (eg, warm orcold antibody hemolytic anemias ). Some\ninfectious and toxic agents, such as the proteases and phos-\npholipases found in many insect and reptile venoms, act by\ndirectly undermining the structural integrity of the erythro-\ncyte membrane. Similarly, some infectious bacteria, including\ncertain strains of Escherichia coli and clostridia, secrete factors\nthat attack and lyse red blood cell membranes. These factors,\ncollectively referred to as hemolysins, can be composed of\nproteins, lipids, or a combination thereof. Parasitic infections(eg, the plasmodia causing malaria) are also a major cause of\nhemolytic anemias in certain geographic areas.\nThe root cause of many hemolytic anemias is intracellular,\nalso referred to as intrinsic . Gluocse-6-phosphate dehydroge-\nnase deficiency falls into this category. Defects in the composi-\ntion or structure of hemoglobin, called hemoglobinopathies ,\nconstitute the second major intrinsic cause of hemolysis. Most\nhemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia and the vari-\nous thalassemias (see Chapter 6), are genetic in nature. In rare\ncases, hemolytic anemia can arise from an insufficiency in the\nenzyme pyruvate kinase . The resulting impairment of glycol-\nysis reduces the production of the ATP required to power the\nexport of excess water and Na+. The resulting osmotic pres-\nsure \n(see later) can compromise and potentially overwhelm\nthe integrity of the erythrocyte membrane.\nMutations that affect the cytoskeletal proteins responsible\nfor maintaining the erythrocyte\u2019s biconcave shape and resis-\ntance to osmotic pressure are classified as membrane-specific\ncauses of hemolytic anemia (see later). The most important\nof these are hereditary spherocytosis andhereditary ellip-\ntocytosis , which arise from abnormalities in the amount or\nstructure of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin. Defects may also\noccur in the synthesis of the glycophosphatidylinositol groups\nthat anchor certain proteins, such as acetylcholinesterase and\ndecay-accelerating factor, to the surface of the erythrocyte\nmembrane, as is the case in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo-\nbinuria (see Chapter 46).\nTHE RED BLOOD CELL MEMBRANE\nEarly analyses by SDS-PAGE of the polypeptides present in red\nblood \ncells revealed 10 major proteins ( Figure 53\u20135 ).

These sphe-\nrocytes are less deformable and more prone to destruction in\nthe spleen than normal erythrocytes, greatly shortening their\nlife in the circulation. This condition, which affects about 1\nin 5000 persons of Northern European ancestry, is caused\nby a deficiency in the amount or abnormalities in the struc-\nture of spectrin or, less frequently, ankyrin or band 3, 4.1, or\n4.2 proteins. Loss of these proteins or impairments of their\ncapacity to associate with other cytoskeletal components weak-\nens the links that anchor the erythrocyte membrane to the\ncytoskeleton, allowing the erythrocyte to swell into a spherical\nshape. The anemia associated with hereditary spherocytosis is\ngenerally relieved by surgical removal of the patient\u2019s spleen\n(splenectomy).\nHereditary elliptocytosis can be readily distinguished\nfrom hereditary spherocytosis by virtue of the fact that theaffected red blood cells assume an elliptic shape. This condition,\nwhich affects 1 in 2500 persons of Northern European descent\nand is even more frequent among populations from regions\nwhere malaria is common, results from genetic abnormalities\nthat affect spectrin or, less frequently, band 4.1 protein or\nglycophorin C.\nTHE BIOCHEMICAL BASIS\nOF \nTHE ABO SYSTEM\nApproximately 30 human blood group systems have been rec-\nognized, the best known of which ar\ne the ABO ,Rh(Rhesus),\nandMNsystems.

The membranes of the erythrocytes of\nmost individuals contain one blood group substance, either\ntype A, B, AB, or O. Individuals of type A have anti-B anti-\nbodies in their plasma that will agglutinate the erythrocytes\nin type B or type AB blood. Individuals of type B have anti-A\nantibodies that will agglutinate type A or type AB erythrocytes.\nType AB blood has neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies, and\nhas been designated the universal recipient . Type O blood has\nneither A nor B antigens, and has been designated the universal\ndonor . The above description has been simplified consider-\nably, as further subgroups exist such as A1and A2. The genes\nresponsib\nle for production of the ABO substances, which are\nlocated on the long arm of chromosome 9, fall into three gen-\notypes, or alleles , two of which are codominant (A and B)\nand the third (O) recessive; these ultimately determine which\nof the four phenotypic products is synthesized: the A, B, AB,\nand O substances.\nThe ABO Antigens Are\nGlycosphingolipids \n& Glycoproteins\nThe ABO antigens or, as they are sometimes referred to, sub-\nstances \nconsist of a set of complex oligosaccharides located on\nthe surface of most cells and as a component of many secre-\ntions (Figure 53\u20137) . In red blood cells, these antigens are gen-\nerally anchored to the cell surface by covalent attachment\nto a membrane lipid, forming a type of molecule known as a\nglycolipid. In secretions the same oligosaccharides are anchored\nto proteins, forming glycoproteins . Their presence in secretions\nis determined by a gene designated Se(for secretor), which\ncodes for a specific fucosyl (Fuc) transferase in secretory\norgans, such as the exocrine glands. This gene is normally silent"

However, red blood cells of both genotypes\ncan express the A and B glycolipid antigens.\nTheAGene Encodes a GalNAc\nTransferase, the BGene a Gal Transferase,\n& the OGene an Inactive Product\nH substance , the blood group substance found in persons\nof type O, is the precursor of both the A and B substances\n(see Figure 53\u20137). It is formed by the action of a fucosyl-\ntransferase , coded for by the H locus, that catalyzes the\naddition of an \u03b11 \u21922 linked fucose onto the terminal Gal\nresidue of its precursor:\nGDP \u2212 Fuc + Gal \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 R \u2192Fuc \u2212 \u03b11, 2 \u2212 Gal \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 R + GDP\nPrecursor H substance\nThe Agene encodes a UDP-GalNAc-specific GalNAc\ntransferase that adds a GalNAc to H substance, forming A\nsubstance. The Bgene encodes a UDP-Gal-specific Gal trans-\nferase that adds the Gal residue to H substance to form B\nsubstance. Individuals of type AB possess both enzymes, and\nthus synthesize two oligosaccharide chains (see Figure 53\u20137),\none with a terminal GalNAc and the other with a terminal Gal.\nAnti-A antibodies recognize the additional GalNAc residue\npresent in the A substance, and anti-B antibodies recognize\nthe additional Gal residue found in the B substance. Type O\nindividuals harbor a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding\nthe terminal glycosyltransferase that results in the production\nof an inactive protein. Thus, H substance thus constitutes the\nO antigen.\nAnhallele arises when a mutation in the portion of\nH locus that codes for the fucosyltransferase yields an inac-\ntive enzyme. While individuals of the heterozygous H hgeno-\ntype still can synthesize adequate levels of H substance, hh\nhomozygous individuals cannot. Since H substance is the\nprecursor for A and B substances, all individuals carryingthehhgenotype will have red blood cells of type O regardless\nof whether or not they express one of both of the A and B ter-\nminal glycosyltransferase(s). This is referred to as the Bombay\nphenotype (O h).\nPLATELETS\nPlatelets Contain Mitochondria,\nBut \nLack a Nucleus\nWhen megakaryocytes, the progenitors of red blood cells,\nare exposed to thrombopoietin they may fragment and f\norm\nplatelets (see Figure 53\u20131). Like red blood cells, platelets lack\na nucleus, but unlike erythrocytes they possess mitochondria,\nlysozymes, and a tubular network that forms an open cana-\nlicular system . This honeycomb of channels increases the sur-\nface area of the platelets, which are spheroidal at rest, thereby\nfacilitating the secretion of various endocrine and coagula-\ntion factors (see Chapter 55). These factors are stored inside\nthe platelets within densely packed secretory vesicles, called\ngranules. Dense granules contain Ca2+, ADP , and serotonin,\nwhile \u03b1-granules conta\nin fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-\nderived growth factor, von Willebrand factor, or other coag-\nulation factors ready for release on receipt of an appropriate\nstimulus (see Chapter 55). Under normal circumstances, these\nsmall (2-\u03bcm diameter), enucleated cells circulate at a density\nof 2 to 4 \u00d7 105plat elets per milliliter of blood. While platelets\nderive the majority of their energy from metabolizing glu-\ncose, their mitochondria enables them to generate ATP via the\n\u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids.\nPlatelet Disorders Compromise\nHemostasis\nAbnormalities in platelet number or function can have serious\nphysio\nlogic consequences.

The\npresence \nof larger than normal platelets also correlates with an\nincreased frequency of myocardial infarction.\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by the\nformation of antibodies against ones own platelets. This\nautoimmune disorder is marked by depressed platelet counts\n(thrombocytopenia ). When a platelet\u2019s surface becomes\ndecorated with antibodies, it is subject to clearance by splenic\nmacrophages. In some instances, platelet autoantibodies will\nbind to differentiating megakaryocytes, depressing platelet\nproduction. Thrombocytopenia also can occur when persons\nwho are homozygous for a mutant variant of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa\nin which the leucine 33 is replaced by proline receive blood\nfrom a donor that is homo- or heterozygous for the wild-type\nform of this major platelet antigen. Exposure to the donor\u2019s\nplatelets triggers the production of alloantibodies that attack\nnot only the donated platelets, but the patient\u2019s endogenous\nplatelets as well. In neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia ,\nwhich affects roughly 1 in 200 term pregnancies, antibodies\nfrom the mother\u2019s circulation cross the placental barrier and\nattack platelets in the fetus\u2019 circulatory system. Thrombocyto-\npenia also can be induced by drugs such as tamoxifen, ibuprofen,\nvancomycin, and many sulfonamides.\nThe symptoms of hemolytic-uremic syndrome , a disease\nof infants characterized by progressive kidney failure, include\nboth thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. By contrast,\nthe abnormal bleeding associated with von Willebrand disease\nis caused by a genetic defect that compromises the ability of\nplatelets to adhere to the endothelium, rather than a deficit\nin platelet number. Other bleeding disorders resulting from\ndefects in platelet adherence include Bernard-Soulier syn-\ndrome (genetically inherited deficiency in glycoprotein 1b),\nandGlanzmann thrombasthenia (genetically inherited defi-\nciency in the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex).\nRECOMBINANT DNA\nTECHNOL\nOGY HAS HAD\nA PROFOUND IMPACT\nON HEMATOLOGY\nThe bases of the thalassemias and of many disorders of coag-\nulation (see Chapter 55) have been greatly clarified by inves-\ntigations utilizing gene cloning and DNA sequencing, while\nthe study of oncogenes and chromosomal translocations has\nadvanced our understanding of the leukemias . As discussed\nearlier, recombinant DNA technology has made available\ntherapeutically useful quantities of erythropoietin andother\ngrowth factors .\nThe first pathophysiologic condition to be treated by gene\ntherapy was a deficiency of adenosine deaminase . Lympho-\ncytes are particularly sensitive to deficits in this enzyme. In\n1990, Dr. William French Anderson introduced a new copy\nof the gene, carried on a retroviral vector, into a 4-year-old\ngirl suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency\n(bubble boy disease). Although the patient is still required totake medications, the replacement gene has remained stable\ninto adulthood.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Major causes of anemia include blood loss, deficiencies of\niron, \nfolate, and vitamin B12, and various factors that cause\nhemolysis.\n\u25a0The shape of the red blood cell contributes to the efficiency of\ngas ex\nchange and to its ability to undergo deformation when\npassing through capillaries.\n\u25a0The production of red cells and platelets is regulated by\neryt\nhropoietin, thrombopoietin, and other cytokines.\n\u25a0Mature red blood cells, which lack internal organelles, are\ndependent \non glycolysis to generate ATP .\n\u25a02,3-Bisphosphoglycerate mutase catalyzes the isomerization\nof \nthe glycolytic intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to form\n2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which stabilizes T-state hemoglobin.\n\u25a0Methemoglobin is unable to transport oxygen.\n\u25a0Cytochrome b5reductase r educes the Fe3+of methemoglobin to\nFe2+, restoring function.\n\u25a0The red cell contains a battery of cytosolic enzymes\u2014superoxide\ndis\nmutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase\u2014that catalyze\nthe neutralization of reactive oxygen species.\n\u25a0Deficiencies in the quantity or the activity of glucose-6-phosphate\ndeh\nydrogenase, which produces NADPH, constitute a major\ncause of hemolytic anemia.\n\u25a0Cytoskeletal proteins such as spectrin, ankyrin, and actin\ninteracting \nwith integral membrane proteins underlie the\nflexible biconcave shape of red blood cells.\n\u25a0Deficiencies or defects of spectrin can lead to hereditary\nspher\nocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis, both causes of\nhemolytic anemia.\n\u25a0Band 4.1 protein facilitates the exchange of bicarbonate and\nchloride \nions across erythrocyte membranes.\n\u25a0The ABO blood group substances of the red cell membrane are\ncomplex g\nlycosphingolipids.

Chemokines can be\ndivided into four subc\ue040asses based on the number and spacing\nof the cysteine residues that participate in the disu\ue040fide bonds\nthat stabi\ue040ize the protein\u2019s conformation. Type C chemokines\nare characterized by a sing\ue040e intrachain disu\ue040fide bond \ue040inking\na pair of conserved cysteine residues. In addition to this con-\nserved disu\ue040fide bond, the other three recognized chemokine\ngroups possess a second disu\ue040fide bond ( Figure 54\u20133 ). In typeCC chemokines, one of the additiona\ue040 cysteine residues \ue040ies\nadjacent to the first of the universa\ue040\ue040y conserved residues. In\ntypes CXC and CX3C, these cysteines are separated by one and\nthree \nintervening amino acid residues, respective\ue040y.

Integrins consist of noncova\ue040ent\ue040y associated\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, each of which consists of an extrace\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar,\ntransmembrane, and intrace\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar segment. The extrace\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar\nsegments bind to various extrace\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar matrix proteins\nthat possess Arg-G\ue040y-Asp sequences, whi\ue040e the intrace\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar\ndomains bind to cytoske\ue040eta\ue040 components such as actin and\nvincu\ue040in.

Much of this coordination is\naccomp\ue040ished by secreting a diverse set of sma\ue040\ue040 (< 25 kDa)\nproteins, termed cytokines , that inc\ue040udes inter\ue040eukins, inter-\nferons, and chemokines.\nThe more than three dozen known interleukins derive\ntheir name from the ce\ue040\ue040s in which they are synthesized and\nfrom which they are secreted. They are genera\ue040\ue040y designated\nby the c\ue040ass abbreviation ILfo\ue040\ue040owed by an identifying num-\nber, for examp\ue040e, IL1, IL3, IL22. The interferons (IFN) , on the\nother hand, derive their name from their abi\ue040ity to inhibit, or\ninterfere, with the rep\ue040ication of infecting viruses. Approxi-\nmate\ue040y 10 distinct fami\ue040ies of interferons have been identified\nin anima\ue040s to date. Chemokines attract and activate migrating\n\ue040eukocytes to a site of injury or infection. Most cytokines are\ng\ue040ycosy\ue040ated. In genera\ue040, they stimu\ue040ate both the type of \ue040euko-\ncytes from which they are secreted ( autocrine signaling ) as\nwe\ue040\ue040 as other types of \ue040eukocytes ( paracrine signaling ). His-\ntorica\ue040\ue040y, cytokines have been distinguished from hormones\nby their c\ue040ose association with immunity and inf\ue040ammation.\nLeukocytes a\ue040so secrete \ue040ipid mediators, ca\ue040\ue040ed eicosanoids ,\nproduced by the oxidation of arachidonic acid (see Chapter 15).\nThese \ue040ipid mediators fa\ue040\ue040 into two broad c\ue040asses, leukotrienes\nand prostaglandins . Leukotrienes are characterized by the\npresence of a set of three conjugated carbon\u2013carbon doub\ue040e\nbonds. Severa\ue040 incorporate the amino acid cysteine into theirstructure. Prostag\ue040andins, which were first iso\ue040ated from the\nprostate g\ue040and, contain 20 carbon atoms and are distinguished\nby their common five-membered ring.\nHistamine (see Figure 54\u20131), which is synthesized by\ndecarboxy\ue040ating the amino acid histidine, is secreted in \ue040arge\namounts by activated basophils and mast cells . Histamine\nworks with other hemato\ue040ogic factors, such as heparin and\neicosanoids, to maintain b\ue040ood f\ue040ow to a site of injury or infec-\ntion and stimu\ue040ate the accumu\ue040ation of f\ue040uid (edema). The\naccumu\ue040ated f\ue040uid at the site of inf\ue040ammation faci\ue040itates \ue040euko-\ncyte migration, thereby enhancing the immune response.\nLYMPHOCYTES PRODUCE\nPRO\nTECTIVE ANTIBODIES\nLymphocytes mak e up approximate\ue040y 30% of the \ue040eukocytes\npresent in the b\ue040ood. Their capacity to produce nove\ue040 protective\nantibodies against new\ue040y encountered antigens (see Chapter 53)\nmakes them the cornerstone of the body\u2019s adaptive immune\nsystem . The c\ue040assification of \ue040ymphocytes into B and T types\norigina\ue040\ue040y was based on the identity of the tissues in which each\nform comp\ue040eted their maturation. In avian species, the B \ue040ympho-\ncytes (B ce\ue040\ue040s) are processed in the bursa of Fabricius . The B ce\ue040\ue040s\nin humans, which \ue040ack this organ, mature in the bone marrow.\nMaturation of T lymphocytes (T cells) takes p\ue040ace in the thymus .\nB \ue040ymphocytes secrete the so\ue040ub\ue040e antibodies present in bodi\ue040y\nhumors, for examp\ue040e, p\ue040asma and interstitia\ue040 f\ue040uids, and are there-\nfore said to confer humoral immunity .\nLymphocytes that have not yet been stimu\ue040ated to produce\nimmunog\ue040obu\ue040ins are said to be na\u00efve . Synthesis of a new anti-\nbody by a naive \ue040ymphocyte can be triggered in severa\ue040 ways.\nG\ue040ycoproteins, \ue040ipopo\ue040ysaccharides, or peptidog\ue040ycans from\nan infecting microorganism can bind to their corresponding\nreceptor on the \ue040ymphocyte\u2019s surface. A\ue040ternative\ue040y, the \ue040ym-\nphocyte can be activated by encountering an antigen that has\nbeen presented on the surface of another white b\ue040ood ce\ue040\ue040 in\nassociation with the MHC. Plasma cells such as macrophages,\nneutrophi\ue040s, and phagocytic \ue040ymphocytes a\ue040\ue040 possess the\ncapacity to disp\ue040ay or present fragments of macromo\ue040ecu\ue040es\nderived from phagocytized microbes. Helper T cells a\ue040so can\npresent antigens on their surface, inc\ue040uding materia\ue040 derived\nfrom debris ejected by phagocytes that they have ingested\nby endocytosis. He\ue040per T ce\ue040\ue040s a\ue040so serve as \u201cce\ue040\ue040u\ue040ar switch-\nboards, \u201d coordinating the immune response by receiving, pro-\ncessing, and sending signa\ue040s from and to other components of\nthe immune system.\nCytotoxic T cells recognize proteins that appear on the\nsurface of host ce\ue040\ue040s as a consequence of vira\ue040 infection or\noncogenic transformation. Once bound, they induce the \ue040ysis\nof the target ce\ue040\ue040 using perforins, proteins that form channe\ue040s\nin the p\ue040asma membrane, and proteases ca\ue040\ue040ed granzymes,\nwhich mimic the action of the cathepsin proteases that nor-\nma\ue040\ue040y trigger programmed ce\ue040\ue040 death ( apoptosis ).Natural\nkiller cells resemb\ue040e cytotoxic T ce\ue040\ue040s, but contain granu\ue040es\nho\ue040ding additiona\ue040 toxic chemica\ue040s to aid in their attack."

Hemorrhagic and thrombotic\nstates can cause serious medical emergencies, and thromboses\nin the coronary and cerebral arteries are major causes of death\nin many parts of the world. Rational management of these con-\nditions requires a clear understanding of the bases of platelet\nactivation, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis.\nHEMOSTASIS & THROMBOSIS\nHA\nVE THREE COMMON PHASES\nHemostasis is the cessation of b leeding from a cut or severed\nvessel, whereas thrombosis occurs when the endothelium lin-\ning blood vessels is damaged or removed (eg, on rupture of an\natherosclerotic plaque). These processes involve blood vessels,\nplatelet aggregation, and plasma proteins that cause formation\nor dissolution of platelet aggregates and fibrin.In hemostasis, there is initial vasoconstriction of the injured\nvessel, causing diminished blood flow distal to the injury. Then,\nhemostasis and thrombosis share three phases :\n1.Formation of a loose and temporary platelet aggregate\nat the site of injury. Platelets bind to collagen at the site\nof vessel wall injury, form thromboxane A2(TxA2), and\nrelease \nADP , which activate other platelets flowing by the\nvicinity of the injury. (The mechanism of platelet activa-\ntion is described later.) Thrombin, formed during coagu-\nlation at the same site, causes further platelet activation.\nOn activation, platelets change shape and, in the presence\nof fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor, aggregate to\nform the hemostatic plug (in hemostasis) or thrombus\n(in thrombosis).\n2.Formation of a fibrin mesh that binds to the platelet aggre-\ngate forming a more stable hemostatic plug or thrombus.\n3.Partial or complete dissolution of the hemostatic plug or\nthrombus by plasmin.55\nO B J E C T I V E S\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou \nshould be able to:\u25a0Understand the significance of hemostasis and thrombosis in health and\ndisease.\n\u25a0Outline the steps leading to platelet aggregation.\n\u25a0Identify antiplatelet drugs and their mode of inhibition.\n\u25a0Outline the pathways of coagulation that result in the formation of fibrin.\n\u25a0Identify the vitamin K\u2013dependent coagulation factors.\n\u25a0Provide examples of genetic disorders that lead to bleeding.\n\u25a0Describe the process of fibrinolysis.Hemostasis & Thrombosis\nPeter L.

            "Text": "678 SECTION XI Special Topics (C)\nThere Are Three Types of Thrombi\nThree types of thrombi or clots are distinguished. All three\ncon\ntainfibrin in various proportions:\n1.The white thrombus is composed of platelets and fibrin\nand is relatively poor in erythrocytes. It forms at the site\nof an injury or abnormal vessel wall, particularly in areas\nwhere blood flow is rapid (arteries).\n2.Thered thrombus consists primarily of red cells and fibrin.\nIt morphologically resembles the clot formed in a test tube\nand may form in vivo in areas of retarded blood flow or\nstasis (eg, veins) with or without vascular injury, or it may\nform at a site of injury or in an abnormal vessel in conjunc-\ntion with an initiating platelet plug.\n3.A third type is fibrin deposits in very small blood vessels\nor capillaries.\nWe shall first describe some of the aspects of the involvement\nof platelets and blood vessel walls in the overall process. Then, we\nshall describe the coagulation pathway leading to the formation\nof fibrin. This separation of platelets and clotting factors is artifi-\ncial since both play intimate and often mutually interdependent\nroles in hemostasis and thrombosis; however, this strategy facili-\ntates description of the overall processes involved.\nPlatelet Aggregation Requires\nOutside\n-In and Inside-Out\nTransmembrane Signaling\nPlatelets normally circulate in an unstimulated disk-shaped form.\nDu\nring hemostasis or thrombosis, platelets become activated\nand help form hemostatic plugs or thrombi (Figure 55\u20131 ).\nThree major steps are involved: (1) adhesion to exposed collagen\nin blood vessels; (2) release (exocytosis) of the contents of their\nstorage granules; and (3) aggregation.\nPlatelets adhere to collagen via specific receptors on the\nplatelet surface, including the glycoprotein complexes GPIa-IIa\n(\u03b12\u03b21 integrin; see Chapter 54) and GPIb-IX-V , and GPVI. The\nbinding of GPIb-IX-V to collagen is mediated via von Willebrand\nfactor; this interaction is especially important in platelet adher-\nence to the subendothelium under conditions of high shear\nstress that occur in small vessels and partially stenosed arteries.\nPlatelets that are bound to collagen change shape and\nspread out on the subendothelium. These adherent platelets\nrelease the contents of their storage granules (the dense gran-\nules and the alpha granules); some of the molecules released\namplify the responses to vessel wall injury. Granule release is\nalso stimulated by thrombin.\nThrombin , formed from the coagulation cascade (described\nlater), is the most potent activator of platelets and initiates\nactivation by interacting with its receptors protease-activated\nreceptor-1 (PAR-1) ,PAR-4 , and GPIb-IX-V on the platelet\nplasma membrane (see Figure 55\u20131A). The further events\nleading to platelet activation on binding to PAR-1 and PAR-4\nare examples of outside-in transmembrane signaling , in whicha chemical messenger outside the cell generates effector mole-\ncules inside the cell (see Chapter 42). In this instance, thrombin\nacts as the external chemical messenger (stimulus or agonist).\nThe interaction of thrombin with its G-protein\u2013coupled recep-\ntors PAR-1 and PAR-4 stimulates the activity of an intracellular\nphospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2) . This enzyme hydrolyzes the mem-\nbrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate\n(PIP2, a polyphosphoinositide) to form the two internal effec-\nto\nr molecules ( 1,2-diacylglycerol [DAG] and1,4,5-inositol\ntrisphosphate [IP3]; se e Figures 42\u20136 and 42\u20137).\nHydrolysis of PIP2is also involved in the action of many\nhormones and drugs. DAG stimulates protein kinase C\n(PKC), which phosphorylates the protein pleckstrin (47 kDa).\nThis results in aggregation and release of the contents of the\nstorage granules. ADP released from dense granules can also\nactivate platelets via its specific G-protein\u2013coupled receptors\n(see Figure 55\u20131A; P2Y1, P2Y12), resulting in aggregation of\nadditi\nonal platelets. IP3cau ses release of Ca2+int o the cytosol\nmainly from the dense tubular system (or residual smooth endo-\nplasmic reticulum from the megakaryocyte), which then inter-\nacts with calmodulin and myosin light-chain kinase, leading\nto phosphorylation of the light chains of myosin. These chains\nthen interact with actin, causing changes of platelet shape.\nCollagen-induced activation of a platelet cytosolic phos-\npholipase A2(cPLA2) by increased levels of intracellular Ca2+\nres\nults in liberation of arachidonic acid from platelet mem-\nbrane phospholipids, leading to the formation of thromboxane\nA2 (TxA2; see Chapters 21 and 23). TxA2, in turn, by binding to\nits s\npecific G-protein\u2013coupled receptor ( TP), can further acti-\nvate PLC\u03b2, promoting platelet aggregation (see Figure 55\u20131A).\nAll of the aggregating agents , including thrombin, collagen,\nADP , TxA2, and others such as platelet-activating factor, via an\nin\nside-out signaling pathway , modify the platelet surface glyco-\nprotein complex GPIIb-IIIa (\u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin; see Chapter 54)\nso that the receptor has a higher affinity for fibrinogen orvon\nWillebrand factor (see Figure 55\u20131B). Molecules of divalent\nfibrinogen or multivalent von Willebrand factor then link\nadjacent activated platelets to each other, forming a platelet\naggregate. von Willebrand factor\u2013mediated platelet aggrega-\ntion occurs under conditions of high shear stress. Agents such\nas epinephrine, serotonin, and vasopressin, exert synergistic\neffects with other aggregating agents.\nActivated platelets, besides forming a platelet aggregate,\naccelerate the activation of the coagulation factor X and pro-\nthrombin by exposing the procoagulant anionic phospholipid\nphosphatidylserine on their membrane surface (see following\nsection for more detail). Polyphosphate, released from the\ndense granules, accelerates factor V activation and also accel-\nerates factor XI activation by thrombin.\nEndothelial Cells Synthesize\nProstacyclin \n& Other Compounds\nThat Affect Clotting & Thrombosis\nTheendot helial cells in the walls of blood vessels make impor-\ntant contributions to the overall regulation of hemostasis and"

As described in Chapter 23, these cells synthesize\nthe prostanoid prostacyclin (PGI2), a potent inhibitor of plate-\nlet aggr\negation. Prostacyclin acts by stimulating the activity of\nadenylyl cyclase in the surface membranes of platelets via its\nG protein\u2013coupled receptor (see Figure 55\u20131A). The resulting\nincrease of intraplatelet cAMP opposes the increase in the level\nof intracellular Ca2+pr oduced by IP3and thus inhibits plate-\nlet activation. This is in contrast with the effect of the pros-\ntanoid TxA2that  is formed by activated platelets, which is thatof promoting aggregation. Endothelial cells play other roles in\nthe regulation of thrombosis. For instance, these cells possess\na surface-expressed ecto- ADPase , which hydrolyzes ADP , and\nthus opposes its aggregating effect on platelets. In addition,\nthese cells express proteoglycans such as heparan sulfate , an\nanticoagulant, and they also release plasminogen activators ,\nwhich may help dissolve thrombi.

The most used\nantiplatelet drug is aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) , which irre-\nversibly acetylates and thus inhibits the platelet cyclooxygenase\n(COX-1) involved in formation of TxA2(see Chapter 21);\nTxA2is a potent aggregator of platelets and also a vasocon-\nstrictor. Platelets are very sensitive to aspirin; as little as 30 mg\nof aspirin/day (one regular aspirin tablet contains 325 mg)\neffectively eliminates the synthesis of TxA2by plate lets. Aspi-\nrin also inhibits production of prostaglandin I2(PGI2), which\nopposes platelet aggrega\ntion and is a vasodilator, by endothe-\nlial cells, but unlike platelets, these cells regenerate cyclooxy-\ngenase within few hours. Thus, the overall balance between\nTxA2and PGI2can be shifted in favor of the latter, opposing\nplatelet aggregation. Indications for treatment with aspirin\ninclude management of acute coronary syndromes (angina,\nmyocardial infarction), acute stroke syndromes (transient\nischemic attacks, acute stroke), severe carotid artery stenosis,\nand primary prevention of these and other atherothrombotic\ndiseases.\nOther antiplatelet drugs include specific inhibitors of the\nP2Y12receptor for ADP ( eg,clopidogrel ,prasugrel ,ticagre-\nlor, and cangrelor ) and of the thrombin receptor PAR-1\n(vorapaxar), and antagonists of ligand binding to GPIIb-IIIa\n(eg, abciximab ,eptifibatide , and tirofiban ) that interfere\nwith fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor binding and thus\nplatelet aggregation.\nBoth Extrinsic & Intrinsic Coagulation\nPath\nways Result in the Formation of\nFibrin\nTwo coagulation pathways lead to fibrin clotformation: the\nextrinsic and the intrinsic pathways. Contrary to previous\nthought, these pathways are not independent. However, this\nartificial distinction is retained in the following text to facili-\ntate their description.\nInitiation of fibrin clot formation in response to tissue\ninjury is carried out by the extrinsic pathway . The intrinsic\npathway can be activated by negatively charged surfaces in\nvitro, for example, glass. Both pathways lead to the proteolytic\nconversion of prothrombin tothrombin . Thrombin cata-\nlyzes cleavage of fibrinogen to initiate fibrin clot formation.\nThe extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are complex and involve\nmany different proteins ( Figures 55\u20132 and55\u20133; Table 55\u20131 ).\nThe coagulation factors are another example of multidomain\nproteins sharing conserved domains (see Figure 5\u20139). In gen-\neral, as shown in Table 55\u20132 , these proteins can be classified\ninto five types : (1) zymogens of serine-dependent proteases\nthat are activated during the process of coagulation; (2) cofac-\ntors; (3) fibrinogen; (4) a zymogen of a transglutaminase that\ncovalently cross-links fibrin and stabilizes the fibrin clot; and\n(5) regulatory and other proteins.The Extrinsic Pathway Leads to\nActivation \nof Factor X\nTheextrinsic pathway involves tissue factor, factors VII and\nX, and Ca2+and results in the production of factor Xa (by con-\nvention, activated clotting factors are referred to by use of the\nsuffix a). The extrinsic pathway is initiated at the site of tissue\ninjury with the exposure of tissue factor (TF; see Figure 55\u20132),\nlocated in the subendothelium and on activated monocytes.\nTF interacts with and activates factor VII (53 kDa, a zymogen-\ncontaining vitamin K\u2013dependent \u03b3-carboxyglutamate [Gla]\nresidues; see Chapter 44), synthesized in the liver. It should\nbe noted that in the Gla-containing zymogens (factors II,\nVII, IX, and X), the Gla residues in the amino-terminal\nregions of the molecules serve as high-affinity binding sites\nfor Ca2+. TF acts as a cofactor for factor VIIa, enhancing its\nenzymatic activity to activate factor X (56 kDa).

Indeed, the formation of complexes\nbetween membrane-bound TF and factor VIIa is now con-\nsidered to be the key process involved in initiation of blood\ncoagulation in vivo .\nTissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a major physi-\nologic inhibitor of coagulation.

This, in turn, also cleaves an Arg-Ile bond in fac-\ntor X to produce factor Xa . This latter reaction requires the\nassembly of components, called the intrinsic tenase complex,\ncomposed of Ca2+-factor VIIIa-factor IXa , which forms on\nprocoagulant membrane surfaces expressing phosphatidyl-\nserine, often activated platelets. (Note that this phospholipid\nis normally on the inner leaflet side of the plasma membrane\nbilayer of resting, nonactivated platelets.)\nFactor VIII (330 kDa), a circulating glycoprotein, is not\na protease precursor but a cofactor precursor that, when acti-\nvated, serves as a receptor on the platelet surface for factors IXa\nand X. Factor VIII is activated by minute quantities of thrombin\nto form factor VIIIa , which is in turn inactivated on further\ncleavage by thrombin-mediated activated protein C (see later).\nThe role of the initial steps of the intrinsic pathway in\ninitiating coagulation has been called into question because\npatients with a hereditary deficiency of factor XII, prekalli-\nkrein or HMW kininogen do not exhibit bleeding problems.\nSimilarly, patients with a deficiency of factor XI may not have\nbleeding problems. In thrombosis, deficiencies in the intrinsic\npathway are protective. The intrinsic pathway largely serves\ntoamplify factor Xa and ultimately thrombin formation ,through feedback mechanisms (see later).

It is subsequently inactivated by activated pro-\ntein C (see later), thereby providing a means of limiting the\nactivation of prothrombin to thrombin. Prothrombin (72 kDa;\nsee Figure 55\u20134) is a single-chain glycoprotein synthesized\nin the liver. The amino-terminal region of prothrombin (see\nFigure 55\u20133) contains 10 Gla residues, and the serine-dependent\nactive protease site is in the catalytic domain close to the\ncarboxyl-terminal region of the molecule. On binding to\nthe complex of factors Va and Xa on the procoagulant mem-\nbrane (see Figure 55\u20134), prothrombin is cleaved by factor Xa attwo sites to generate the active, two-chain thrombin molecule,\nwhich is then released from the membrane surface.\nConversion of Fibrinogen to Fibrin Is\nCatalyzed \nby Thrombin\nThrombin , produced by the prothrombinase complex, in\naddition to having a potent stimulatory effect on platelets\n(see earlier), converts fibrinogen to fibrin (see Figure 55\u20132).\nFibrinogen (factor I, 340 kDa; see Figure 55\u20132 and Figure 55\u20135 ;\nTables 55\u20131 and 55\u20132) is an abundant (3 mg/mL) soluble\nplasma glycoprotein that consists of a dimer of three polypep-\ntide chains, ( A\u03b1,B\u03b2,\u03b3)2, that is covalently linked by 29 disul-\nfide \nbonds. The B\u03b2 and \u03b3chains contain asparagine-linked\ncomplex oligosaccharides (see Chapter 46). All three chains\nare synthesized in the liver; the three genes encoding these pro-\nteins are on the same chromosome where their expression is\ncoordinately regulated in humans. The amino-terminal regions\nof the six chains are held in close proximity by a number of\ndisulfide bonds (a subset is shown in Figure 55\u20135), while the\ncarboxyl-terminal regions are spread apart. Thus, the fibrino-\ngen molecule has a trinodular, elongated structure with a cen-\ntral E domain that is linked to lateral D domains via coiled coil\nregions (Figure 55\u20135 and Figure 55\u20136A ). The N-terminal A\nandBportions of the A\u03b1 and B\u03b2 chains are termed fibrino-\npeptide A (FPA) andfibrinopeptide B (FPB) , respectively;\nthese domains are highly negatively charged as a result of an\nabundance of aspartate and glutamate residues (see later).

Since\nFP\nA and FPB contain only 16 and 14 residues, respectively,\nthe fibrin molecule retains 98% of the residues present in\nfibrinogen. The removal of the fibrinopeptides exposes bind-\ning sites within the E domain of fibrin monomers that spe-\ncifically interact with complementary domains within the D\ndomains of other fibrin monomers. In this way, fibrin mono-\nmers spontaneously polymerize in a half-staggered pattern to\nform long strands (protofibrils) (see Figure 55\u20136A). Although\ninsoluble, this initial fibrin clot is unstable, held together only\nby the noncovalent association of fibrin monomers.\nIn addition to converting fibrinogen to fibrin, thrombin\nalso activates factor XIII to factor XIIIa. Factor XIIIa is a\nhighly specific transglutaminase that covalently cross-links \u03b3\nchains and, more slowly, \u03b1 chains of fibrin molecules by form-\ning peptide bonds between the amide groups of glutamine and\nthe \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues (see Figure 55\u20136C). Such\ncross-linking yields a more stable fibrin clot with increased\nresistance to proteolysis. This fibrin mesh serves to stabilize\nthe hemostatic plug or thrombus.\nLevels of Circulating Thrombin Are\nCarefully \nControlled\nOnce active thrombin is formed in the course of hemostasis\nor \nthrombosis, its concentration must be carefully controlled\nto prevent further fibrin formation or platelet activation. This\nis achieved in two ways . Thrombin circulates as its inactive\nprecursor, prothrombin, which is activated as a consequence\nof a cascade of enzymatic reactions, each converting an inactive\nzymogen to an active enzyme and leading finally to the conver-\nsion of prothrombin to thrombin (see Figure 55\u20132). At each\npoint in the cascade, feedback mechanisms produce a deli-\ncate balance of activation and inhibition. The concentration\nof factor XII in plasma is approximately 30 \u03bcg/mL, while that\nof fibrinogen is 3 mg/mL, with intermediate clotting factors\nincreasing in concentration as one proceeds down the cascade;\nthese facts illustrate that the clotting cascade provides ampli-\nfication . The second means of controlling thrombin activity\nisthe inactivation of any formed thrombin bycirculating\ninhibitors , the most important of which is antithrombin\n(see later).\nThe Activity of Antithrombin, an\nInhibitor \nof Thrombin, Is Increased\nby Heparin\nFour natu rally occurring thrombin inhibitors exist in normal\nplasma. The most important is antithrombin , which contributes\napproximately 75% of the antithrombin activity. Antithrom-\nbin can also inhibit the activities of factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa,\nand VIIa complexed with tissue factor. \u03b12-macroglobulin co n-\ntributes most of the remainder of the antithrombin activity,with heparin cofactor II and\u03b11-antitrypsin acting as minor\ninhibitors under physiologic conditions.\nThe endogenous activity of antithrombin is greatly potenti-\nated by the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (heparans)\n(see Chapter 50). Heparans bind to a specific cationic site of\nantithrombin, which induces a conformational change that\npromotes binding of antithrombin to thrombin and factor Xa,\nas well as to its other substrates. This mechanism is the basis\nfor the use of heparin , a derivatized heparan, in clinical medi-\ncine to inhibit coagulation. The anticoagulant effects of hepa-\nrin can be antagonized by strongly cationic polypeptides such\nasprotamine, which bind strongly to heparin, thus inhibiting\nthe binding of heparin to antithrombin.\nLow-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) , derived from\nenzymatic or chemical cleavage of unfractionated heparin, have\nmore clinical use. They can be administered subcutaneously at\nhome, have greater bioavailability than unfractionated heparin,\nand do not need frequent laboratory monitoring.\nIndividuals with inherited deficiencies of antithrombin\nare prone to develop venous thrombosis, providing evidence\nthat antithrombin has a physiologic function and that the coag-\nulation system in humans is normally in a dynamic state.\nThrombin is involved in an additional regulatory mecha-\nnism that operates in coagulation. It combines with thrombo-\nmodulin , a glycoprotein present on the surfaces of endothelial\ncells. The complex activates protein C on the endothelial\nprotein C receptor . In combination with protein S ,activated\nprotein C (APC) degrades factors Va and VIIIa, thereby lim-\niting their actions in coagulation (see Table 55\u20132). A genetic\ndeficiency of either protein C or protein S can cause venous\nthrombosis. Furthermore, patients with factor V Leiden (which\nhas a glutamine residue in place of an arginine at position 506)\nhave an increased risk of venous thrombotic disease because\nactivated factor V Leiden is resistant to inactivation by APC;\nthis condition is also termed APC resistance.\nCoumarin Anticoagulants Inhibit the\nVitamin \nK\u2013Dependent Carboxylation of\nFactors II, VII, IX, & X\nThe couma rin drugs (eg, warfarin), which are used as anti-\ncoagulants, inhibit the vitamin K\u2013dependent carboxylation\nof Glu to Gla residues (see Chapter 44) in the amino-terminal\nregions of factors II, VII, IX, and X and also proteins C and S.\nThese proteins, all of which are synthesized in the liver, are\ndependent on the Ca2+-binding properties of the Gla resi-\ndues \nfor their normal function in the coagulation pathways.\nCoumarins inhibit the reduction of the quinone deriva-\ntives of vitamin K to the active hydroquinone forms (see\nChapter 44). Thus, the administration of vitamin K will bypass\nthe coumarin-induced inhibition and allow the posttransla-\ntional modification of carboxylation to occur. Reversal of cou-\nmarin inhibition by vitamin K requires 12 to 24 hours, whereas\nreversal of the anticoagulant effects of heparin by protamine is\nalmost instantaneous. Coumarin reversal is achieved faster by\ninfusing normal coagulation factors."

Their effect is not well predictable by dosage, and\nthus because of the risk of producing hemorrhage, these drugs\nare closely monitored by use of appropriate tests of coagulation\n(see later).\nNew oral inhibitors of thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or of\nfactor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and others)\nare also used in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic\nconditions. These drugs are advantageous because their effect\nis predictable based on the dose, and some do not require routine\nmonitoring by laboratory tests. Specific reversal agents, such\nas antibodies or decoy molecules, are approved, or in various\nstages of development. Agents that target the \u201cintrinsic\u201d factors\nare being evaluated as antithrombotics.\nFibrin Clots Are Dissolved by Plasmin\nAs stated earlier, the coagulation system is normally in a state\nof \ndynamic equilibrium in which fibrin clots are constantly\nbeing laid down and dissolved. This latter process is termed\nfibrinolysis .Plasmin , the serine protease mainly responsible\nfor degrading fibrin and fibrinogen, circulates in the form of\nits inactive zymogen, plasminogen (90 kDa), and any small\namounts of plasmin that are formed in the fluid phase under\nphysiologic conditions are rapidly inactivated by the fast-acting\nplasmin inhibitor, \u03b12-antiplasmin. Plasminogen binds to fibrin\nand thus\n becomes incorporated in clots as they are produced;\nsince plasmin that is formed when bound to fibrin is protected\nfrom \u03b12-antiplasmin, it remains active. Act ivators of plas-\nminogen of various types are found in most body tissues, and\nall cleave the same Arg-Val bond in plasminogen to produce\nthe disulfide bridge-linked two-chain serine protease, plasmin\n(Figure 55\u20137 ). The specificity of plasmin for fibrin is another\nmechanism to regulate fibrinolysis. Via one of its kringle\ndomains, plasmin(ogen) specifically binds lysine residues on\nfibrin and so is increasingly incorporated into the fibrin meshas it cleaves it. (Kringle domains [see Figure 55\u20133] are com-\nmon protein motifs of about 100 amino acid residues in length;\nthey have a characteristic covalent structure defined by a pat-\ntern of three disulfide bonds.) Thus, the carboxypeptidase acti-\nvated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa)\n(see Figure 55\u20137), which removes terminal lysines from fibrin,\nalso inhibits fibrinolysis. Thrombin activates TAFI to TAFIa,\nthereby inhibiting fibrinolysis during clot formation.\nTissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (see Figures 55\u20133\nand 55\u20137) is a serine protease that is released into the circu-\nlation from vascular endothelium under conditions of injury\nor stress and is catalytically inactive unless bound to fibrin.\nOn binding to fibrin, t-PA cleaves plasminogen within the clot\nto generate plasmin, which in turn digests the fibrin to form\nsoluble degradation products and thus dissolves the clot.\nNeither plasmin nor the plasminogen activator can remain\nbound to these degradation products, and so they are released\ninto the fluid phase where they are inactivated by their natural\ninhibitors. Prourokinase is the precursor of a second activa-\ntor of plasminogen, urokinase . Originally isolated from urine,\nit is now known that urokinase is synthesized by various cell\ntypes including monocytes and macrophages, fibroblasts, and\nepithelial cells. The main action of urokinase appears to be the\ndegradation of extracellular matrix. Figure 55\u20137 indicates the\nsites of action of five proteins that influence the formation and\naction of plasmin.\nRecombinant t-PA & Streptokinase Are\nUsed \nas Clot Busters\nt-PA, marketed as alteplase , is produced by recombinant DNA\nmethods. It is used therapeutically as a fibrinolytic agent, as is\nstreptokinase , an enzyme secreted by a number of streptococ-\ncal bacterial strains. However, the latter is less selective than\nt-PA, activating plasminogen in the fluid phase (where it can\ndegrade circulating fibrinogen) as well as plasminogen that is\nbound to a fibrin clot. The amount of plasmin produced by\ntherapeutic doses of streptokinase may exceed the capacity\nof the circulating \u03b12-antiplasmin, causing fibrinogen as well\nas \nfibrin to be degraded and resulting in the bleeding often\nencountered during fibrinolytic therapy.

If administered early enough, before irrevers-\nible damage of heart muscle occurs (about 6 hours after onset\nof thrombosis), t-PA can significantly reduce the mortality\nrate from myocardial damage following coronary thrombosis.\nStreptokinase has also been widely used in the treatment of cor-\nonary thrombosis, but has the disadvantage of being antigenic.\nt-PA has also been used in the treatment of ischemic stroke,\nperipheral arterial occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and pul-\nmonary embolism. The fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid,\na lysine analogue, is an inhibitor of plasmin activity used ther-\napeutically to treat bleeding.\nThere are a number of disorders, including cancer and\nsepsis, in which the concentrations of plasminogen activa-\ntors increase . In addition, the antiplasmin activities contrib-\nuted by \u03b11-antitrypsin and \u03b12-antiplasmin may be impaired\nin d\niseases such as cirrhosis. Since certain bacterial proteins,\nsuch as streptokinase, are capable of activating plasmino-\ngen, they may be responsible for the diffuse hemorrhage\nsometimes observed in patients with disseminated bacterial\ninfections.\nThere Are Several Hereditary Bleeding\nDisorders, \nIncluding Hemophilia A\nInherited deficiencies of the clotting system that result in bleed-\ning are found in humans. The most common is deficiency of\nfactor VIII, causing hemophilia A , which is an X chromosome-\nlinked disease. Hemophilia B , also X chromosome-linked, is\ndue to a deficiency of factor IX and has recently been identified\nas the form of hemophilia that played a major role in the history\nof the royal families of Europe. The clinical features of hemo-\nphilia A and B are almost identical, but these two diseases can\nbe readily distinguished by specific assays for the two factors.\nThe gene for human factor VIII, F8,one of the largest\nknown genes, is 186 kb in length, containing 26 exons that encode\na protein of 2332 amino acids, while the gene for human\nfactor IX, F9,is much smaller, 33 kb in length, containing\n8 exons that encode a protein of 415 amino acids. A variety\nof variants in F8andF9have been detected leading to dimin-\nished activities of the factor VIII and IX proteins; these include\npartial gene deletions and point and missense variant. Prenatal\ndiagnosis by DNA analysis after chorionic villus sampling or\namniocentesis is now possible (see Chapter 39).\nTreatment for patients with hemophilia A consisted ini-\ntially, in the 1960s, of intravenous administration of cryoprecip-\nitate (enriched in factor VIII) prepared from individual donors;\nin the 1970s, lyophilized factor VIII or factor IX concentrates,\nprepared from very large plasma pools, became available for\ntreatment of hemophilia A and B patients, respectively. In the\n1990s, factors VIII and IX prepared by recombinant DNA\ntechnology (see Chapter 39) were introduced. Such prepara-\ntions are free of contaminating viruses (eg, hepatitis A, B, C,\nor HIV-1) found in human plasma, but are expensive; their use\nwill increase as the cost of production decreases. Longer-actingrecombinant factors with extended half-lives in the circula-\ntion are now in use. A novel, nonfactor replacement, therapy\nfor hemophilia A that is administered subcutaneously is a\nbispecific antibody to factor X and factor IXa that brings these\ntwo proteins together as factor VIIIa would. Gene therapy for\nhemophilia is presently in late-phase clinical investigations.\nThe most common hereditary bleeding disorder is von\nWillebrand disease , with a prevalence of up to 1% of the popu-\nlation. It results from a deficiency or defect in von Willebrand\nfactor , a large multimeric glycoprotein that is secreted by\nendothelial cells and platelets into the plasma, where it stabi-\nlizes factor VIII. von Willebrand factor also promotes platelet\nadhesion at sites of vessel wall injury and platelet aggregation\nunder conditions of high shear (see earlier).\nLaboratory Tests Measure Platelet\nAggrega\ntion, Coagulation,\n& Thrombolysis\nA number of labo ratory tests are available to measure the\nphases of hemostasis described earlier. The tests include plate-\nlet count ,bleeding time/closure time ,platelet aggregation ,\nactivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or PTT) ,\nprothrombin time (PT) ,thrombin time (TT) ,concentra-\ntion of fibrinogen, fibrin clot stability , and measurement of\nfibrin degradation products . The platelet count quantitates\nthe number of platelets. The skin bleeding time is an overall\ntest of platelet and vessel wall function, while the closure time\nmeasured using the high shear Platelet Function Analyzer\nPFA-100/200 is an in vitro test of platelet-related hemostasis.\nPlatelet aggregation measures responses to specific aggregat-\ning agents. aPTT is a measure of the intrinsic pathway and\nPT of the extrinsic pathway, with aPTT being used to moni-\ntor heparin therapy and PT to measure the effectiveness of\nwarfarin. The reader is referred to a textbook of hematology\nfor a discussion of these tests.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Hemostasis and thrombosis are complex processes involving\nplat\nelets, coagulation factors, and blood vessels.\n\u25a0Thrombin and other agents cause platelet aggregation, which\ninv\nolves a variety of biochemical and morphologic events.\nStimulation of phospholipase C and the polyphosphoinositide\npathway is a key event in platelet activation, but other processes\nare also involved.\n\u25a0Aspirin is an important antiplatelet drug that acts by inhibiting\nprod\nuction of thromboxane A2.\n\u25a0Many coagulation factors are zymogens of serine proteases,\nbecoming activa\nted, then inactivated during the overall\nprocess.\n\u25a0Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation exist, the\nformer \ninitiated in vivo by tissue factor. The pathways converge\nat factor Xa, ultimately resulting in thrombin-catalyzed\nconversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is strengthened by\ncovalent cross-linking, catalyzed by factor XIIIa."

Approxi-\nmately 10 million people around the world die from cancer\neach year, and this figure is projected to increase. Humans\nof all ages develop cancer, and a wide variety of organs are\naffected. Worldwide, the main types of cancer accounting for\nmortality are those involving the lung, stomach, colon, rec-\ntum, liver, and breast. Other types of cancers that lead to death\ninclude cervical, esophageal, and prostate cancers. Skin can-\ncers are also very common, but apart from melanomas, they\nare generally not as aggressive as those mentioned earlier. The\nincidence of many cancers increases with age . Hence, as peo-\nple live longer, many more will develop the disease. Hereditary\nfactors play a role in some types of tumors. Apart from great\nindividual suffering caused by the disease, the economic bur-\nden to society is immense.\nSOME GENERAL COMMENTS ON\nNEOPLASMS\nA neoplasm or tumor refers to any abnormal new growth of\ntissue. \nIt may be benign or malignant in nature. The term\n\u201ccancer\u201d is usually associated with malignant tumors. Tumorscan arise in any organ in the body and result in different clini-\ncal features, depending on the location of the growth.\nCancer cells are characterized by certain key properties :\n(1) ability for rapid proliferation ; (2) increased genomic\nmutations at the level of the nucleotide, small and large inser-\ntions and deletions (indels), and gross chromosomal rearrange-\nments, duplications and loss; (3) loss of contact inhibition in\nculture in vitro ; (4) invasion of local tissues andspread to\nother parts of the body (metastasis ); (5) self-sufficiency\nin growth signals while developing insensitivity to anti-\ngrowth signals ; (6) ability to stimulate local angiogenesis ;\nand (7) are often able to evade apoptosis . These properties\nare characteristic of cells of malignant tumors . Metastasis of\ntumor cells is generally responsible for the deaths of patients\nwho have cancer. By contrast, cells of benign tumors also\nshow diminished control of growth, but do not invade local\ntissue or spread to other parts of the body. These points are\nsummarized in Figure 56\u20131 and amplified on in Figure 56\u20132 .\nCentral issues in oncology (the study of cancer) include elu-\ncidation of biochemical and genetic mechanisms that underlie\nthe uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and their ability to invade\nand metastasize, and development of successful treatments that\nwill destroy cancer cells, while causing minimal damage to\nnormal cells.

Organismal immuno-\nlogic status and tissue microenvironment are two such factors.\nRecent work has shown that the microenvironment of hostand tumor cells, and the interactions between them contribute\nto the pathogenesis of malignancies. However, many aspects\nof the behavior of cancer cells, in particular their ability to\nmetastasize, have yet to be fully explained. In addition, despite\nimprovements in treatment of certain types of cancers, thera-\npies are still often unsuccessful. This chapter aims to introduce\nthe reader to key concepts of cancer biology. A glossary at the\nend of this chapter defines many of the terms used herein.\nFUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF\nCARCINOGENESIS\nNonlethal genetic damage is thought to be the initiating event\nin \ncarcinogenesis. There are several broad classes of genes,\nwhich when mutated cause either gain- or loss-of-function\nor misregulation of cellular processes, and can thus result in\nthe development of a tumor. Such genes are proto-oncogenes ,\ntumor suppressor genes ,genes involved in DNA synthesis\nandrepair , genes involved in chromosome segregation , genes\nregulating apoptosis , or those involved in evasion of immune\nsurveillance . Mutations in cancer cells fall into two categories:\n\ue033river mutations and passenger mutations. Driver muta-\ntions are mutations in genes from one (or more) of the classes\nof genes listed earlier; only \ue033river mutations transform nor-\nmal cells to cancer cells . By contrast, passenger mutations areActivation of\ninvasion and\nmetastasisSelf-sustaining\nproliferative\ngrowth signaling\nEvasion of growth\nsuppressorsInduction of blood\nvessel growth\n(angiogenesis)\nLimitless replicative\ngrowth potentialResistance\nto apoptosis\nFIGURE 56\u20131 Major biological features of cancer cells.

Many changes, in addition to those indicated in\nFigure 56\u20131, can be observed in cancer cells; only some of these are shown here. The roles of mutations in activating oncogenes and inactivat-\ning tumor suppressor genes are discussed in the text. Abnormalities in cell cycle progression and of chromosome and chromatin structure,\nincluding aneuploidy, are common in cancer cells. Alterations of expression of specific mRNAs and regulatory ncRNAs have been reported, and the\nrelationship of stem cells to cancer cells is a very active area of research. Telomerase activity is often elevated in cancer cells. Tumors sometimes syn-\nthesize certain fetal antigens, which may be measurable in the blood. Changes in plasma membrane constituents (eg, alteration of the sugar chains\nof various glycoproteins\u2014some of which are cell adhesion molecules\u2014and glycolipids) have been detected in many studies, and may be of impor-\ntance in relation to decreased cell adhesion and metastasis. Various molecules are released from cancer cells, in either soluble or membrane-bound\nvesicular forms (exosomes), and can be detected in the blood or extracellular fluid; these include metabolites, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and\nnucleic acids. Angiogenic factors and various proteinases are also released by some tumors. Many changes in metabolism have been observed; for\nexample, cancer cells often exhibit a high rate of aerobic glycolysis.

The cellular milieu of a tumor,\ntermed the tumor microenvironment (TME) , significantly\naffects tumor formation. The exact nature of these influences\nmay vary with cell types involved, cell-to-cell interactions, and\nthe presence of factors such as paracrine signals, local hypoxia,\nand local pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, carcinogenesis\nis a multistep process that ultimately transforms normal cells\ninto malignant cells. Tumor formation can take from a few,\nto tens of years, to develop to macroscopic levels.\nCAUSES OF GENETIC DAMAGE\nThe nonlethal genetic damage causing cancer can be due to\neither acquire\ue033 orinherite\ue033, \nor both types of mutations .\nThose that are acquired result either from errors in DNA rep-\nlication or DNA repair (termed replication mutations [R]) ,\nor from exposure to environmental carcinogens (termed envi-\nronmental mutations [E] ) (radiation, chemicals, and viruses;\nFigures 35\u201322, 35\u201323 and see following discussion). The third\nmajor class of oncogenic mutations is termed here\ue033itary\nmutations (H) ; inherited mutations are derived from one or\nboth parents. Such hereditary abnormalities result in a num-\nber of familial con\ue033itions that predispose to development of a\ncancer that is hereditary in nature. These mutations are found\nin specific genes (eg, tumor suppressor genes; DNA repair\ngenes, cell cycle control genes, etc; see Chapter 35) present in\ngerm cells, and are discussed later in this chapter. Mutations\nof the R, E, and H variety collectively cause the majority of\nhuman cancers, though the exact percentage of a particular\ntype of cancer caused by these three types of mutations varies.\nSpontaneous mutations , some of which may predispose\nto the development of cancer, occur at a frequency of approxi-\nmately 10\u22127to 10\u22126per cell per generation. This ra te is greater\nin tissues with a high rate of proliferation, a dynamic that can\nincrease the generation of cancer cells from affected parent\ncells. Oxi\ue033ative stress (see Chapter 45), generated as a result\nof enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS ),\nmay also be a factor in increasing mutation rates.\nRADIATION, CHEMICALS, &\nCERT\nAIN VIRUSES ARE MAJOR\nKNOWN CAUSES OF CANCER\nIn general, there are three classes of environmental carcino-\ngens that can i\nnduce tumor formation: ra\ue033iation ,chemicals ,\nand certain oncogenic viruses (Figure 56\u20133 ). The first two\ncarcinogens cause mutations in DNA, while viruses gener-\nally act either by introducing novel genes, or modulating the\nexpression of growth-regulatory cellular genes in normal cells.\nWe shall only briefly describe how radiation, chemicals, and\noncogenic viruses cause cancer because many of the specificlesions, and molecules involved in their repair, have been pre-\nsented in Chapter 35.\nRadiation Can Be Carcinogenic\nUltraviolet (UV) rays, x-rays , and \u03b3-rays are mutagenic and\ncarcinogenic. \nExtensive studies have shown that these agents\ndamage DNA in a number of ways ( Table 56\u20131 ; see also\nTable 35\u20138, and Figure 35\u201322). Mutations in DNA, if not\ncorrected, are thought to underlie the carcinogenic effect of\nra\ue033iation , although the exact pathways are still under inves-\ntigation. Additionally, x-rays and \u03b3-rays can induce formation\nofreactive oxygen species (ROS), which (as mentioned earlier)\nare also mutagenic and probably contribute to the carcinogenic\neffects of radiation.\nExposure to UV radiation commonly occurs due to expo-\nsure to sunlight, which is its main source. Ample evidence\nshows that UV radiation is linked to cancers of the skin. The\nrisk of developing a skin cancer due to ultraviolet radiation\nincreases with increased frequency and intensity of exposure,\nand decreases with increasing melanin content of skin.\nAs detailed in Chapter 35, DNA damage produced by envi-\nronmental agents is usually removed by DNA repair mecha-\nnisms. Not surprisingly then, given the mutagenic nature of\nDNA damage, individuals who have an inherited inability to\nefficiently repair DNA have increased risk of developing a\nmalignancy (see Table 35\u20139).\nMany Chemicals Are Carcinogenic\nA wide variety of chemical compounds are carcinogenic\n(T\nable 56\u20132 ).\nMost chemical carcinogens are thought to covalently\nmo\ue033ify DNA, thereby forming a wide range of nucleoti\ue033e\na\ue033\ue033ucts (see Table 35\u20138).

Most ultimate carcinogens are electro-\nphiles (molecules deficient in electrons; see Chapter 2) and\nreadily attack nucleophilic (electron-rich) groups in DNA.\nConversion of chemicals to ultimate carcinogens is principally\ndue to the actions of various species of the enzyme cytochrome\nP450 , which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\n(see Chapters 12, 47). This fact is applied in the Ames assay\n(see later), in which an aliquot of post-mitochondrial superna-\ntant (containing ER) is added to the assay system as a source of\ncytochrome P450 enzymes.\nChemical carcinogenesis involves two stages \u2014initiation\nandpromotion . Initiation is the stage where chemical exposure of\nDNA results in genomic DNA damage, some of which goes unre-\npaired. Unrepaired DNA changes are a necessary initial event for\na cell to become cancerous. Promotion is the stage at which such\nan \u201cinitiated\u201d cell begins to grow and proliferate abnormally. The\ncumulative effect of these two events can result in a neoplasm.\nChemical carcinogens can be identified by testing their\nability to induce mutations. A simple way to do this is by using\ntheAmes assay (Figure 56\u20134 ). This simple test, which detects\nmutations in the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium caused by\nchemicals, has proven very valuable for screening potential\ncarcinogens. A modification of the Ames test is to add an aliquot\nof mammalian ER to the assay, to make it possible to identify\nprocarcinogens. Very few, if any, compounds that have tested\nnegative in the Ames test have been shown to cause tumors in\nanimals. However, animal testing is required to unambiguously\nshow that a chemical is carcinogenic.\nIt should be noted that compounds that alter epigenetic\nfactors (such as DNA methylation and/or histone modifica-\ntions [posttranslational changes]; see Chapters 35, 38) that\nmight predispose to cancer, would not be identifiable by the\nAmes test, as they are not mutagenic.Certain Human Cancers Are\nCaused \nby Viruses\nThe study of tum or viruses has contributed significantly to\nthe understanding of cancer. For example, discovery of both\noncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (see later) emerged\nfrom studies of oncogenic viruses. Both DNA and RNA viruses\nhave been identified as being able to cause cancers in humans\n(Table 56\u20133 ). The details of how each of these viruses causes\ncancer will not be described here. In general, the process\ninvolves incorporation (ie, integration) of genetic material of\nviruses into the genome of the host cell. In the case of RNA\nviruses, this would occur after reverse transcription of\nthe viral RNA to viral DNA. (An exception to this rule is\nHepatitis C virus [HCV] which is an RNA virus that is onco-\ngenic but does not contain/utilize a viral reverse transcriptase.)\nSuch integration of viral DNA (called the provirus) into host\ncell DNA results in various effects such as \ue033eregulation of\nthe cell cycle, inhibition of apoptosis , and abnormalities\nof cell-signaling pathways (see Chapters 35, 42). All theseTABLE 56\u22122 Some Chemical Carcinogens\nClass Compound\nPoly\ncyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbonsBenzo[a]pyrene, dimethylbenzanthracene\nAromatic amines 2-Acetylaminofluorene, N-methyl-4-\naminoazobenzene (MAB)\nNitrosamines Dimethylnitrosamine, diethylnitrosamine\nVarious drugs Alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide),\ndiethylstilbestrol\nNaturally occurring\ncompoundsAflatoxin B1\nNote: As list ed above, some drugs used as chemotherapeutic agents (eg, cyclophos-\nphamide) can be carcinogenic.Add bacteria that require\nhistidine for \ngrowth (His\u2013)\nDiffusion \nof\nadded chemicalAdd suspected\nmutagen\nIncubation\nMany His+revertant\ncoloniesMost\nremain His\u2212\nIf chemical is not a mutagen,\nfar fewer colonies form.If chemical isa mutagen,\nmany colonies form.Solid agar growth medium\nlacking histidine\nFIGURE 56\u20134 The Ames assay to screen for mutagens.

DNA viruses often\nact by \ue033ownregulation of the expression, and/or function\nof tumor suppressor genes P53andRB(see later) and their\nprotein products. RNA viruses often carry oncogenes in their\ngenomes; how oncogenes act to cause malignancy is discussed\nlater.\nONCOGENES & TUMOR\nSUPPRESSOR \nGENES PLAY KEY\nROLES IN CAUSING CANCER\nOver the past several decades, major advances have been made\nin under\nstanding how cancer cells develop and grow. Two key\nfindings were the discoveries of oncogenes andtumor sup-\npressor genes . These discoveries pointed to specific molecular\nmechanisms through which cell growth and division could be\ndysregulated, resulting in abnormal growth.\nOncogenes Are Derived From Cellular\nGenes \nTermed Proto-Oncogenes, Which\nEncode a Wide Variety of Proteins That\nStimulate Cell Growth\nAnoncogene can be defined as an altered gene, the product of\nwhich acts in a \ue033ominant manner to accelerate cell growth or\ncell division. Oncogenes are generated by \u201cactivation\u201d of nor-\nmal cellular genes, termed proto-oncogenes , which encode\ngrowth-stimulating proteins. Such activation can be affected\nthrough any of several different mechanisms ( Table 56\u20134 ).\nTable 56\u20134 lists an example of a point mutation occurring\nin the RAS oncogene. RAS encodes a small GTPase. Loss of\nthe GTPase activity of this G-protein results in chronic stimu-\nlation of the activity of adenylyl cyclase and the MAP kinase\npathway, leading to cell proliferation (recall that G-proteins are\nactive when complexed with GTP and inactive when the bound\nGTP is hydrolyzed to GDP by their intrinsic GTPase activity;\nsee Chapter 42). Another way an oncogene can be activatedis via insertion of an enhancer and/or a strong promoter\nupstream of a protein-coding gene, resulting in increased\ntranscription (and hence protein expression) of the cognate\ngene. Figure 56\u20135A illustrates how integration of a retroviral\nprovirus (ie, the reverse transcriptase-generated dsDNA copy\nof the RNA genome of a tumor virus such as Rous sarcoma\nvirus, RSV ) can act as an enhancer/promoter to activate MYC ,\na neighboring host gene. Overproduction of the oncogenic\ntranscription factor MYC activates the transcription of many\ngenes, cell cycle\u2013regulatory genes among them. Such Myc-\ninduced overexpression of proteins stimulates unregulated cell\nproliferation.\nChromosomal translocations are found quite frequently\nin cancer cells; literally hundreds of different examples have\nbeen documented. The translocation found in cases of Burkitt\nlymphoma is illustrated in Figure 56\u20135B . The overall effect\nof this translocation is that the MYC gene comes under the\ninfluence of the powerful IgG heavy chain-encoding gene\nenhancer, resulting in increased transcription of the MYC\ngene, and subsequent increased cell proliferation.\nYet another mechanism of oncogene activation is via\ngene amplification (see Figure 38\u201320), a phenomenon that\noccurs quite commonly in various cancers. What happens is\nthat multiple copies of an oncogene are formed, which results\nin increased production of the growth-promoting protein\nencoded by that gene.\nActivated oncogenes promote cancer through a variety of\nmechanisms; summarized in Figure 56\u20136 . The protein productsTABLE 56\u22123 Some Viruses That Cause or Are Associated\nWith \nHuman Cancers\nVirus Genome Cancer\nEpstein-Barr \nvirus DNA Burkitt lymphoma,\nnasopharyngeal cancer,\nB-cell lymphoma\nHepatitis B DNA Hepatocellular carcinoma\nHepatitis C RNA Hepatocellular carcinoma\nHuman herpesvirus 8\n(HHV-8)DNA Kaposi sarcoma\nHuman papilloma\nviruses (types 16\nand 18)DNA Cancer of the cervix\nHuman T-cell leukemia\nvirus type 1RNA Adult T-cell leukemiaTABLE 56\u22124 Mechanisms by Which Oncogenes Are\nActivated\nMechanism Explanation\nMutation\nA classic example is a point mutation of\ntheRASoncogene. This results in the gene\nproduct, a small G-protein (RAS), in which\nthe intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein\nis lost. Consequently, cells are subjected to\nconstitutively active signaling via stimulation\nof adenylyl cyclase and the mitogen-activated\nprotein (MAP) kinase pathway.\nPromoter\ninsertionInsertion of a viral promoter sequence near an\noncogene activates it.\nEnhancer\ninsertionInsertion of a viral enhancer sequence near an\noncogene activates it.\nChromosomal\ntranslocationA piece of one chromosome is split off and is\njoined to another, resulting in activation of an\noncogene at the site where insertion occurs.\nClassic examples of such translocations include\nthose seen in Burkitt lymphoma (see Figure\n56\u22125) and in the Philadelphia chromosome in\nchronic myelocytic leukemia (see the Glossary).\nGene\namplificationaAbnormal multiplication of a gene occurs,\nresulting \nin many copies. This can occur\nwith oncogenes and genes involved in drug\nresistance.\naRegions of gene amplification may be recognized as homogeneously stained regions\n(HSRs) \non chromosomes, or as double minute chromosomes (which are extrachromo-\nsomal in location)."

The reverse process moves\na small segment from the q arm of chromosome 14 to chromosome 8; these translocations involve regions q24 (chromosome 8) and q32\n(chromosome 14). The MYC gene is contained in the small piece of chromosome 8 that was transferred to chromosome 14. Thus, MYC is placed\nadjacent to the genes transcribing the heavy chains of immunoglobulin molecules, and MYC gene transcription is activated by the potent IgG H\ngene enhancer. Many other translocations have been identified, with perhaps the best known being that involved in formation of the Philadelphia\nchromosome seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (see the Glossary)."

It was the study of the Rous Sarcoma\nvirus (RSV) retrovirus, that first revealed the existence of\noncogenes. Further study showed that many retroviral onco-\ngenes were derived from normal cellular genes, the so-called\nproto-oncogenes, which the tumor viruses had acquired dur-\ning their passage through host cells.\nTumor Suppressor Genes Act to Inhibit\nCell \nGrowth & Division\nAtumor suppressor gene produces a protein that normally\nsuppresses cell growth or cell division. When such a gene is\naltered by mutation, the inhibitory effect of its product is lost\nor diminished. Thus, loss-of-function of a tumor suppressor\ngene leads to increased cell growth or division. As first sug-\ngested by AG Knudson based on his studies of the inheritance\nof retinoblastomas in 1971, it is now known that both copies\nof the RBtumor suppressor gene must be mutated for the RB\nprotein to lose its inhibitory effect on cell growth regulation.\nThe loss-of-function retinoblastoma gene allele, rb\u2212, is recessive\nto a \nwild-type RBcopy of the gene.\nA useful distinction has been made between gatekeeper\nandcaretaker functions of tumor suppressor genes. Gatekeeper\ngenes (products) control cell proliferation, and include mainly\ngenes that act to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis. By contrast,\ncaretaker gene products are concerned with preserving the\nintegrity of the genome, and include proteins that are involved\nin recognizing and correcting DNA damage, and in maintaining\nchromosomal integrity during cell division.\nMany oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have now\nbeen identified. Only a few are mentioned here. Importantdifferences between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are\nlisted in Table 56\u20135 .Table 56\u20136 lists some properties of two\noncogenes ( MYC andRAS), and tumor suppressor genes ( P53\nandRB; see Chapter 35) that have been studied most intensively.\nStudies of the Development of\nColorectal \nCancers Have Illuminated\nthe Involvement of Specific Oncogenes\n& Tumor Suppressor Genes\nMany types of tumors have been analyzed for genetic changes.\nOne of the earliest studied and most informa\ntive areas in this\nrespect has been analysis of the \ue033evelopment of colorectal\ncancer by Vogelstein and colleagues. Their work, and that of\nothers, has shown the involvement of various oncogenes and\ntumor suppressor genes in human cancer. These workers\nanalyzed the sequence and expression of various oncogenes,\ntumor suppressor genes, and other relevant genes in sam-\nples of normal colonic epithelium , of\ue033ysplastic epithelium\n(a preneoplastic condition characterized by abnormal develop-\nment of epithelium), various stages of a\ue033enomatous polyps ,\nanda\ue033enocarcinomas .

Thus, tumors\nmay contain a variety of cells with different genotypes, making\nit difficult to treat successfully.\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from these results\nand those from other similar studies. First, cancer is truly a\ngenetic \ue033isease , but in a somewhat different sense from the\nnormal meaning of the phrase, insofar as many of the gene\nalterations are due to somatic mutations. Second, carcinogenesis\nis a multistep process . It is estimated that in most cases a min-\nimum of five to six genes must be mutated for cancer to occur.\nThird, additional subsequent mutations are thought to confer\nselective advantages on certain clones of cells, some of which\nacquire the ability to metastasize (see later). Finally, many of\nthe genes implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and other\ntypes of cancers are involved in cell signaling events, showing\nagain the central role that alterations in signaling play in the\n\ue033evelopment of cancer .\nGROWTH FACTORS &\nABNORMALITIES \nOF THEIR\nRECEPTORS & SIGNALING\nPATHWAYS PLAY MAJOR ROLES IN\nCANCER DEVELOPMENT\nThere Are Many Growth Factors\nA large variety of polypeptide growth factors that affect human tis-\nsu\nes and cells have been identified. Some are listed in Table 56\u20138 .\nHere, we focus mostly on their relationship with cancer.\nGrowth factors can act in an en\ue033ocrine ,paracrine , or\nautocrine manner (see Chapter 41) and affect a wide varietyof cells, to produce a mitogenic response (see Chapter 42).\nRecall (see Chapter 53) that growth factors play important\nroles in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.\nGrowth inhibitory factors also exist. For example, trans-\nforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2 ) exerts inhibitory effects on the\ngrowth of certain cells. Thus, chronic exposure to either increased\namounts of a growth factor, or to decreased amounts of a growth\ninhibitory factor, can alter the balance of cellular growth.\nGrowth Factors Work via Specific\nRece\nptors & Transmembrane Signaling\nto Affect the Activities of Specific Genes\nGrowth factors produce their effects by interacting with speci fic\nreceptors on cell surfaces, initiating various signaling events\n(see Chapter 42). Genes encoding receptors for growth factors\nhave been identified and characterized. These receptors gener-\nally have short membrane-spanning segments and external and\ncytoplasmic domains (see Chapters 40, 42). A number of these\nreceptors (eg, receptors for epi\ue033ermal growth factor [EGF],\ninsulin, insulin-like growth factor [IGF-I ], and platelet-\n\ue033erive\ue033 growth factor [PDGF ]) have tyrosine kinase activity.\nThe kinase activity, located within the cytoplasmic domains\nof these receptors, causes autophosphorylation of the cognate\nreceptor protein and also phosphorylates certain other proteins\nwhen the receptors are bound by their target ligand.\nConsideration of platelet-derived growth factor, PDGF ,\nillustrates how a particular growth factor brings about its effects.\nInteraction of PDGF with its receptor stimulates the activity\nofphospholipase C (PLC). PLC splits phosphati\ue033ylinositol\nbisphosphate (PIP2) (found in biologic cell membranes) into\ninositol \ntrisphosphate (IP3) and \ue033iac ylglycerol (DAG ) (see\nFigure 42\u20136).

            "Text": "698 SECTION XI Special Topics (C)\nThe expression of miRNA has been found to be dysregu-\nlated \nin many cancers. Such misregulation is thought to have a\ncausal role in the pathogenesis of such cancers. Some miRNAs\nare oncogenic (referred to as oncomiRs) and are overexpressed\nin cancerous tissue. On the other hand, tumor-suppressive\nmiRNAs that counteract oncogenic characteristics are found to\nbe under-expressed in some cancers; the similarity to oncogenes\nand tumor suppressors (described previously) is apt. Examples\nof oncogenic microRNAs include the miR-17-92 polycistronic\nmiRNA encoding gene cluster (implicated in cancers of the lung,\nbreast, pancreas, colon, etc.); miR-21 (in cancers of the lung,\nbreast, etc.); and miR-155 (in lung cancer and lymphoma).\nExamples of tumor suppressing microRNAs include let-7\n(dysregulated in ovarian and lung cancer), miR-34 (implicated in\nvarious types of cancers), miR-15, and miR-16 (both involved\nin chronic lymphocytic leukemia).\nMicroRNAs have also been shown to influence extrin-\nsic factors that modulate tumors. These include interactions\nbetween the immune system and cancer cells, interactions of\nstromal cells, effects on oncoviruses, etc. It is likely that the over-\nall protein expression resulting from specific types and amounts\nof miRNAs determines whether the net effect of a specific\nmiRNA is oncogenic or tumor suppressive.\nThe use of miRNAs in clinical applications is gaining\nground. miRNAs are being investigated as biomarkers for\ncancer diagnosis, prognosis, and classification. These small\nRNAs also hold promise in therapy, where oligonucleotides\nare used to enhance expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs\nin cells, or antisense oligonucleotides are employed to counter\nthe action of oncogenic miRNAs. Several such miRNA-tar-\ngeted therapeutics have been developed, some of which have\nreached clinical trials. However, many challenges remain. For\nexample, Phase I clinical trials using miR-34 for hepatocellu-\nlar carcinoma showed promising therapeutic effects but had to\nbe stopped due to severe adverse effects. Nevertheless, other\nefforts, such as the use of miR-16 for the treatment of malig-\nnant mesotheliomas and non-small cell lung cancers, have met\nwith early success in Phase I trials.\nAnother important clinical application of miRNAs lies\nin their ability to potentiate therapeutic responses during\nanticancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, the use of\nmiRNAs as specific targets for treatment and/or for therapeutic\nsupplementation in the management of cancer appears highly\npromising. However, as with all gene-based therapies, effective\ndelivery of stable oligonucleotides into appropriate target cells\nis extremely challenging. Nevertheless, tremendous advances\nin scientific and pharmaceutical developments are anticipated\nin this area in the years ahead, bringing to clinical practice a\ngroup of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers.\nEXTRACELLULAR VESICLES &\nCANCER\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs ), also referred to as exosomes and\nmicrovesicles , are a group of small vesicles that are enclosed\nby a lipid bilayer that are released by most eukaryotic cells,both normal and diseased (see Figure 40\u201323). These vesicles\nvary from one another in their size and the way in which they\nare formed. Secreted EVs contain a variety of biomolecules\nsuch as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and can be delivered\nto target cells through a range of mechanisms such that they\ncan produce autocrine, paracrine, and even endocrine effects.\nEVs often contain noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) (comprising\nmiRNAs, long non-coding RNAs [lncRNAs], and circular\nRNAs [circRNAs]; see Chapters 34, 36). Thus, EVs represent a\nnovel mechanism of cellular communication.\nExosomes have been shown to transfer information to\ntarget cells by mechanisms such as receptor-ligand binding,\ndirect fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane of recip-\nient cells, or by endocytosis. There is now growing evidence to\nshow that tumor-\ue033erive\ue033 exosomes (TEXs) play an impor-\ntant role in the pathogenesis of tumors. Transfer of ncRNAs\nin this way has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer\n(through laboratory studies that have demonstrated that EVs\ncan modulate expression of crucial genes that are involved\nin tumorigenesis). The effects produced by ncRNAs on their\ntarget cells include control of cell proliferation, induction of\nangiogenesis, alterations in the TME and tumor immunity,\nand even induction of drug resistance. EVs have also been\nshown to act on distant organs, thereby affecting metastasis.\nExosomes are found in several body fluids (serum, plasma,\nurine, etc.) and so have the potential to serve as diagnostic or\nprognostic markers of cancers. They may also be useful as\ntherapeutics. Since they can readily cross biologic membranes,\nthey may be used as effective delivery systems for anticancer\ndrugs (including miRNA or anti-miRNA). Exosomes thus rep-\nresent an exciting new area of oncology. However, additional\nexperimentation will be required in order to make the diag-\nnostic and therapeutic potential of exosomes a clinical reality.\nEPIGENETIC MECHANISMS ARE\nINVOL\nVED IN CANCER\nThere is strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms (see\nChap\nter 36) are involved in the causation of cancer. Such\nmechanisms produce nonmutational changes that affect\nregulation of gene expression. For example, methylation of\nspecific cytosine bases in particular genes has been impli-\ncated in turning off the transcription of certain other genes.\nMultiple changes in the normal pattern of methylation status\nof cytosine residues in specific genes have been detected in\ncancer cells. Histone posttranslational modification status (ie,\nacetylation, ADP-ribosylation, methylation, phosphorylation,\nsumoylation, and ubiquitylation; see Chapters 35 and 38) have\nbeen found in cancer cells. Similarly, mutations that affect the\nstructure and/or activity of the nucleosome remodeling com-\nplexes that are involved in chromatin remodeling can also\naffect gene transcription. Indeed, several of the components of\nthe SWI/SNF complexes likely act as tumor suppressor genes.\nConsistent with these observations that show that chromatin\nand/or DNA modification status is important in oncogenesis,\nit has recently been shown that a significant fraction of certain"

Oncohistones contribute\nimportantly to oncogenesis by changing normal epigenetic\nmodification patterns that are essential for specific gene\ntranscription. Importantly, oncohistones can have dramatic\neffects on the functions of multiple chromatin remodelers\nand, hence, gene regulatory programs.\nA matter of particular interest regarding the role of epi-\ngenetic changes in oncogenic gene expression is that many\nof the protein and DNA modifications responsible are revers-\nible. In this regard, 5-azadeoxycytidine and decitabine are\ninhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (see also\nFigure 32\u201313), while valproic acid and vorinostat act to inhibit\nhistone deacetylases (HDACs). Both of these agents have been\nused to treat certain types of leukemias and lymphomas and\nare thought to work by de-repressing the transcription of cer-\ntain critical growth-regulatory genes, such as tumor suppressors.\nEpigenetic mechanisms are also involved in many aspects\nof resistance to anticancer drugs. For example, resistance to\ntemozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapeutic agent\nfor glioblastoma multiforme, is linked to promotor meth-\nylation of the DNA repair enzyme, O6-methylguanine-DNA\nmethyltran\nsferase (MGMT). Increased activity of MGMT\n(by decreased promotor methylation) rescues cancer cells\nfrom TMZ-induced cell death by accelerating repair of DNA\ndamage induced by the drug. Detection of MGMT promo-\ntor methylation patterns is now being used to classify newly\ndiagnosed glioblastomas and to predict response to TMZ.\nSynthesis and study of additional specific inhibitors that act at\nDNA and protein/enzyme epigenetic levels are active areas of\ninvestigation. Finally, the increasing use of various \u2013omic tech-\nnologies to identify, quantify, and score epigenetic changes\nand their effects on gene expression in many types of can-\ncers is adding considerably to knowledge in this important\narea of research. Two notable examples in this regard are theefforts and results of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas ) and\nPCAWG (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes ) cancer\nbiology consortia.\nA NUMBER OF CANCERS DISPLAY\nA \nHEREDITARY PREDISPOSITION\nIt has been known for many years that certain cancers have\na \nhereditary basis. Depending on the specific cancer type, it\nhas been estimated that 5 to 15% of cancers have a heredi-\ntary etiology. The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppres-\nsor genes has allowed investigation of the molecular basis of\nthis phenomenon. Many types of hereditary cancer have now\nbeen recognized; a few of these are listed in Table 56\u20139 . In a\nnumber of cases, where a hereditary syndrome is suspected,\nappropriate genetic screening of individuals and families has\nallowed early interventions to be made. Some young women,\nwho have inherited either a mutated BRCA1 orBRCA2 gene,\nhave opted for prophylactic mastectomies to prevent cancer\nof the breast occurring in later life. Even without prior knowl-\nedge regarding a familial predisposition to a particular type\nof cancer, screening for colorectal cancer can be readily per-\nformed. Commercial analyses of home, self-sample-collected\nfecal samples can be analyzed for the presence of intestinal cell\nDNA carrying mutations that predispose to colorectal cancer\n(see Figure 56\u20137).\nABNORMALITIES OF THE CELL\nCY\nCLE ARE UBIQUITOUS IN\nCANCER CELLS\nKnowledge of the cell cycle is necessary for understanding\nthe molecular mechanisms involved in the development of\nmany types of cancer.

            "Text": "700 SECTION XI Special Topics (C)\nanticancer drugs act only against cells that are dividing, or are\nin a \ncertain phase of the cycle.\nBasic aspects of the cell cycle were described in Chapter 35.\nAs shown in Figure 35\u201320, the cycle has four phases: G1,S,G2,\nandM. \nIf cells are not in one of these phases, they are said\nto be in the G0phase and are termed quiescent. Cells can be\nrecruited back into the cycle from G0by various influences\n(eg, certain growth factors). Cancer cells usually have a shorter\ngeneration time than normal cells, and there are fewer of them\nin the quiescent G0phase.\nThe \nroles of various cyclins ,cyclin-\ue033epen\ue033ent kinases\n(CDKs ), and a number of other important molecules that\naffect the cell cycle (eg, the protein products of the RBandP53\ngenes) were described in Chapter 35. The points in the cycle\nat which some of these molecules act have been indicated in\nFigures 35\u201320, 35\u201321, and Table 35\u20137.\nBecause a major property of cancer cells is uncontrolled\ngrowth, many aspects of their cell cycle have been studied in\nconsiderable depth. A few important results are mentioned\nhere. A variety of mutations that affect cyclins and CDKs have\nbeen reported. Many products of proto-oncogenes and tumor\nsuppressor genes play important roles in regulating the nor-\nmal cell cycle. A wide variety of mutations have been found\nin these types of genes, including RAS,MYC ,RB, and P53\n(which are among the most studied, see later).\nFor example, as discussed in Chapter 35, the protein prod-\nuct of the RBgene is a regulator of the cell cycle. It acts by\nbinding to a transcription factor E2F, thereby blocking tran-\nscription of genes required for progression of the cell from\nG1 to S phase. Mutation-induced loss of RB protein function,\nthus, removes this element of control of the cell cycle.\nWhen damage to DNA occurs (by radiation or chemicals),\nthe p53 protein increases in amount and activates transcrip-\ntion of genes that delay transit through the cycle. If the damage\nis too severe to repair, p53 activates genes that cause apoptosis\n(see later, and Figure 35\u201323). If p53 is absent or inactive due\nto mutations, apoptosis does not occur and cells with dam-\naged DNA persist, potentially becoming progenitors of cancer\ncells.\nGENOMIC INSTABILITY &\nANEUPL\nOIDY ARE IMPORTANT\nCHARACTERISTICS OF CANCER\nCELLS\nAs referred earlier and also later in this chapter, cancer cell\ngenome\ns carry many mutations. One possible explanation\nfor their genomic instability is that they have a mutator\nphenotype . The idea of mutator phenotypes was originally\npostulated by Loeb and colleagues, who argued that such\nphenotypes were caused by cancer cells having acquired\nmutations in genes involved in DNA replication and DNA\nrepair, thus allowing mutations to accumulate. The concept\nwas later expanded to include mutations that affect chromo-\nsomal segregation, DNA damage surveillance, and processessuch as apoptosis. Increasing evidence suggests that collec-\ntively these various mechanisms, termed errors in genome\nreplicative functions, contribute to a very large proportion\nof cancers.\nThe term genomic instability is frequently used to refer\nto two abnormalities seen in many cancer cells: micro-\nsatellite instability (MSI) and chromosomal instability\n(CIN). MSI was described briefly in Chapter 35. MSI involves\nexpansion or contraction of microsatellite DNA sequences,\nusually due to abnormalities of mismatch repair or replication\nslippage. CIN occurs more often than MSI, and the two are\noften mutually exclusive. CIN refers to gain or loss of chromo-\nsomes caused by abnormalities of chromosomal segregation\nduring mitosis.\nAnother area of interest with regard to CIN is copy num-\nber variation (CNV ) (see Glossary; Chapter 39). Associa-\ntions of various CNVs with many types of cancers have been\nidentified, and their precise roles in carcinogenesis are under\ninvestigation.\nAn important aspect of CIN is aneuploi\ue033y , a very com-\nmon feature of solid tumors. Aneuploidy exists when the\nchromosomal number of a cell is not a multiple of the haploid\nnumber. The degree of aneuploidy often correlates with a poor\nprognosis suggesting that abnormalities of chromosomal seg-\nregation contribute to tumor progression by increasing genetic\ndiversity. Indeed, some scientists believe that aneuploidy is a\nfundamental aspect of cancer.\nMuch research is aimed at determining the basis of CIN\nand aneuploidy. As shown in Figure 56\u20138 , a number of dif-\nferent processes are involved in normal chromosomal seg-\nregation. Each process is complex, and involves various\norganelles and many individual proteins. A textbook of cell\nbiology should be consulted for details of the process of chro-\nmosomal segregation and cell division. Studies are in progress\nto compare these processes in normal and tumor cells, and to\ndetermine which of the differences detected may contribute to\nCIN and aneuploidy. One hope of this line of research is that\nit might be possible to develop drugs that diminish or even\nprevent CIN and aneuploidy.\nCIN syndromesSpindle\nassembly\ncheckpointChromosomal segr egationCentrosome\nnumberChromosomal\ncohesion\nCell cycle\nregulationKinetochore-\nmicrotubule\nattachment\nFIGURE 56\u20138 Factors involved in chromosomal segregation\nthat \nare relevant to understanding chromosomal instability\n(CIN) and aneuploidy.

            "Text": "CHAPTER 56 Cancer: An Overview 701\nMANY CANCER CELLS\nDISPLA\nY ELEVATED LEVELS OF\nTELOMERASE ACTIVITY\nThere has been considerable interest in the involvement of\ntelome\nres in a number of diseases and also in aging (see\nChapters 35 and 57). With respect to cancer, when tumor\ncells divide rapidly their telomeres often shorten. Such short-\nened telomeres have been implicated as a risk factor for many,\nbut not all, solid tumors. Indeed, telomere length has strong\npredictive value with regard to gauging the progression of\nchronic inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis\nandBarrett esophagus , to cancer. Abnormalities of telomere\nstructure and function can contribute to CIN (see earlier).\nThe activity of telomerase , the main enzyme involved in syn-\nthesizing (and thus maintaining the length of) telomeres, is\nvery low in normal somatic cells, but is frequently elevated in\ncancer cells, providing a mechanism for overcoming telomere\nshortening. Hence, inhibiting telomerase activity represents an\nattractive target of cancer chemotherapy, as most cancer cells\n(in contrast to normal somatic cells) exhibit elevated activity of\nthis enzyme. However, any such inhibitor could also adversely\naffect normal stem cells (a ubiquitous class of essential cells\nfound in most tissue types and that require telomerase activity\nfor their regenerative function). This is a major limitation to such\nan approach. However, Imetelstat (GRN163L) is one such agent\nthat has reached clinical trials and has shown promising results\nin the treatment of several tumors, including glioblastoma, lung\nand ovarian cancers. It is likely that additional structural analy-\nsis of the telomerase enzyme, coupled with larger-scale studies\nof small molecule inhibitors, will serve to identify more potent\ncompounds with therapeutic anticancer efficacy.\nCANCER CELLS HAVE\nABNORMALITIES \nOF APOPTOSIS\nTHAT PROLONG THEIR\nPROLIFERATIVE CAPACITY\nApoptosis , also known as programme\ue033 cell \ue033eath (PCD) , is\na genetically directed program, which when activated, causes\ncell death. The main proteins involved in apoptosis are proteo-\nlytic enzymes termed caspases that normally exist in inactive\nforms, the procaspases . The name caspase (cysteine-\ue033epen\ue033ent\naspartate-\ue033irecte\ue033 protease ) is derived from the fact that\nthese enzymes utilize cysteine at their active sites to cleave tar-\nget polypeptide chains at a point immediately after aspartic\nacid residues. About 15 human caspases are known, although\nnot all participate in apoptosis. When the caspases involved in\napoptosis are activated (mainly caspases 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10),\nthey result in a casca\ue033e of events that ultimately kills cells by\ndigesting various proteins and other biomolecules (compare\nwith the coagulation cascade, Chapter 55). The upstream\ncaspases (eg, 2, 8, and 10) at the beginning of the cascade\nare often called initiators , and those downstream at the endof the pathway (caspases 3, 6, and 7) are called effectors or\nexecutioners . Acaspase-activate\ue033 DNase (CAD ) fragments/\ndigests nuclear DNA, thereby producing a characteristic DNA\nladdering pattern that is readily detected by native gel electro-\nphoresis. Histological features of apoptosis include condensa-\ntion of chromatin, changes of nuclear shape, and membrane\nblebbing. The cells that die as a result of these effects are rapidly\ndisposed of by phagocytic activity, thereby avoiding develop-\nment of an inflammatory reaction.\nApoptosis differs from necrosis , a pathologic form of cell\ndeath that is not genetically programmed. Necrosis occurs on\nexposure of cells or tissues to external agents, such as certain\nchemicals and extreme heat (eg, burns). Various hydrolytic\nenzymes (proteases, phospholipases, nucleases, etc.) are involved\nin the process of necrosis. Release of cell contents from dying\ncells can cause local inflammation (unlike apoptosis).\nThe overall process of apoptosis is complex and tightly\nregulated. The apoptotic regulatory pathway involves proteins\nthat act as receptors and adapters, procaspases and caspases, and\npro- and antiapoptotic factors. There are two major pathways,\nextrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic , with mitochon\ue033ria\nbeing an important participant in the latter pathway. Figure 56\u20139\nshows a simplified diagram of some of the key events in apoptosis.\nMajor features of the apoptotic \ue033eath receptor pathway\nare shown on the left-hand side of the figure. External signals\ninitiating apoptosis include tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1 )\nand Fas ligand. A number of death receptors have been identified.\nThese receptors are transmembrane proteins, some of which\ninteract with a\ue033apter proteins (such as FADD [Fas-associate\ue033\nprotein with \ue033eath \ue033omain ]). These complexes, in turn, inter-\nact with procaspase-8 , resulting in its conversion to caspase-8\n(an initiator). Caspase-3 (an effector) is activated via a series\nof further reactions. Caspase 3 digests important structural\nproteins such as lamin (associated with nuclear condensation),\nvarious cytoskeletal proteins, and enzymes involved in DNA\nrepair, causing cell death.\nRegulation of this pathway occurs at several levels. FLIP\n(FLICE [FADD-like IL-1\u03b2-converting enzyme]-inhibitory\nprotein ) is an antiapoptotic regulator that inhibits the conver-\nsion of procaspase-8 to its active form. Inhibitors of apoptosis\n(IAPs ) inhibit the conversion of procaspase-3 (and procaspase-9;\nsee later) to its active form. These effects can be overcome by\nthe protein SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator\nof caspase), which is released from mitochondria.\nThemitochon\ue033rial pathway can be initiated by exposure\nto stimuli such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA\ndamage. Initiation of this pathway results in the formation of\npores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, through which\ncytochrome C escapes into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm,\ncytochrome C interacts with APAF-1 (apoptotic peptidase-\nactivating factor-1), procaspase-9 , and ATP to form a multi-\nprotein complex known as the apoptosome . As a result of this\ninteraction, procaspase-9 is converted to its active form and,\nin turn, acts on procaspase-3 to produce caspase-3 .\nActivation of the p53gene upregulates transcription of\nBAX .

On the other hand, BCL-2\ninhibits this loss of membrane potential, and is thus antiapoptotic.\nIAPs inhibit conversion of procaspase-9 to caspase-9; SMAC\ncan overcome this. Note that the death pathway uses caspase-8 as\nan initiator, whereas the mitochondrial pathway uses caspase-9.\nThese two pathways can interact. In addition, there are also other\npathways of apoptosis, which are not discussed here.\nCancer Cells Evade Apoptosis\nCancer cells have developed mechanisms to evade apopto-\nsis, \nand thus continue to grow and divide. In general, these\nmechanisms involve mutations that cause loss-of-function of\nproteins that are proapoptotic, or from overexpression of anti-\napoptotic genes. One such example concerns loss-of-functionof the P53gene, perhaps the most commonly mutated gene\nin cancers. Resultant loss of upregulation of transcription of\nproapoptotic BAX (see earlier) in p53-deficient cells shifts the\nbalance in favor of antiapoptotic proteins. Overexpression of\nmany antiapoptotic genes is a frequent finding in cancers. The\nconsequent evasion of apoptosis favors the continuing growth\nof cancer cells. Attempts are being made to develop drugs that\nwill specifically turn on apoptosis in cancer cells. Most of these\nagents are small molecules that inhibit the BCL-2 family of\nantiapoptotic proteins. Several chemo- and immunotherapeutic\nagents in current use induce apoptosis in cancer cells via the\nextrinsic pathway. The possibility of potentiating the anti-\ntumor effects of these drugs by combining them with apoptosis-\ninducing agents is being explored.\nAs indicated earlier, apoptosis is a complex, highly regulated\npathway with numerous components, many of which are notShruken apoptotic cell\nCytochrome CPlasma\nmembrane\nBCL-2 BAX\nSMAC\nAPAF-1\nPro-caspase-9\nCaspase-9\nDigestion of\nproteins, DNADegraded\nproteins\nMembrane blebsFragmented\nDNACaspase-3IAPPro-caspase-8Death\nreceptorsDeath ligands\n(TNF- \u03b1, FAS, etc)\nAdapter\nproteins\nPro-caspase-3Caspase-8FLIPMitochond\nrion\nFIGURE 56\u20139 Simplified scheme of apoptosis. The major molecular events in the extrinsic pathway are shown on the left: Death signals\ninclude TNF-\u03b1 and FAS (present on the surface of lymphocytes and some other cells). The signals (ligands) interact with specific death receptors\n(there are a number of them). The activated receptor then interacts with an adapter protein (FADD is one of a number of them), and then forms\na complex with procaspase 8. (The complex is indicated by the interrupted line between the adapter protein and procaspase-8 in the figure).\nThrough a series of further steps, active caspase-3 is formed, which is a major effector (executioner) of cell damage. Regulation of the extrinsic\npathway can occur due to the inhibitory effect of FLIP on the conversion of procaspase-8 to caspase-8, and also the inhibitory effect of IAP on\nprocaspase-3. On the right are the major cellular events in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Various cell stresses affect the permeability of\nthe mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in efflux of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. This forms a multiprotein complex with APAF-1 and\nprocaspase-9, called an apoptosome. Through these interactions, procaspase-9 is converted to caspase-9. This, in turn, can act on procaspase-3\nto convert it to its active form. Regulation of the intrinsic pathway can occur at the level of BAX, which facilitates increasing mitochondrial per-\nmeability permitting efflux of cytochrome c, and is thus pro-apoptotic. BCL-2 opposes this effect of BAX and is thus antiapoptotic. IAP also inhib-\nits procaspase-9; this effect of IAP can be overcome by SMAC.

It\nmay seem paradoxical, but regulated cell death is as important\nin maintaining health, as in formation of new cells. In addition\nto cancer, apoptosis is implicated in other diseases, including\ncertain autoimmune and chronic neurologic disorders, such as\nAlzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, where excessive cell\n\ue033eath (rather than excessive growth) is a feature. Table 56\u201310\nsummarizes some of the principal features of apoptosis.\nPro-Inflammatory and Tumor-Promoting\nEffects \nof Necrosis\nUnlike apoptosis, necrosis of tissue results in release of intra-\ncellular \ncontents into the surrounding microenvironment.\nThese include molecules that serve as mediators of the pro-\ninflammatory response, resulting in the infiltration of tissue by\nimmune inflammatory cells. It has been shown that such cells\ncan have active tumor-promoting effects. Immune inflamma-\ntory cells have been reported to promote angiogenesis, cell pro-\nliferation, and invasiveness. Necrosis, which appears to counter\nthe proliferative tendency of cancerous cells, may paradoxically\nbenefit tumorigenesis. Thus, developing tumors appear to gain\nby tolerance of some degree of cell necrosis, because this results\nin recruitment of inflammatory cells that ultimately supply the\ntumor cells with growth-promoting factors via angiogenesis.\nTHE TUMOR\nMICROENVIRONMENT \nPLAYS\nA CRITICAL ROLE IN CANCER\nDEVELOPMENT, METASTASIS, &\nRESPONSE TO TREATMENT\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) has been shown to play\na vital \nrole in tumor biology. It is involved in the pathogenesis\nof a tumor, its progression, and how it responds to treatment.In addition to cancer cells, the TME consists of a variety of\nnon-cancer cells and components of the extracellular matrix.\nThese include cells of the immune system (T and B lympho-\ncytes, natural killer [NK] cells, and macrophages) and mesen-\nchymal cells (stem cells, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, and\nadipocytes). Complex intercellular and stromal interactions\noccurring in the TME play important roles in cancer cell pro-\nliferation, survival, spread (metastasis), and response to treat-\nment. Exosomes produced from cells within the TME signal\nbetween cancer cells and surrounding cells, and have been\nimplicated in tumor metastasis and drug resistance.\nAlthough a variety of immune cells infiltrate tumors, their\nantitumor effector functions are dampened by tumor-derived\nsignals. Furthermore, T lymphocytes and macrophages are\nreprogrammed (eg, by sustained nuclear factor kappa B [NF-\u03baB]\nactivation; see Figure 42\u201310) to promote tumor growth and\nsurvival. This reprograming can allow cancer cells to escape\nimmune surveillance and also co-opts the immune system to\naccelerate cancer progression. A greater understanding of the role\nof immune cells in the TME in driving carcinogenesis has opened\nup a new and important avenue of cancer treatment called immu-\nnotherapy (discussed in more detail later in the chapter).\nMesenchymal cells, such as the myofibroblasts and mes-\nenchymal stem cells, are known to facilitate formation of can-\ncer stem cell niches, thus aiding cancer stem cell survival and\nproliferation. Other mesenchymal cells, such as endothelial\ncells, respond to paracrine signals in the TME such as vascu-\nlar en\ue033othelial growth factor (VEGF ), by promoting tumor\nangiogenesis and metastasis (see also following discussion).\nAdipocytes in the TME secrete a number of growth factors\nthat support tumor growth. In addition, the extracellular\nmatrix of the TME also contributes to tumor progression by\nfacilitating the formation of cancer stem cell niches, aiding\ntumor invasion and metastasis. Figure 56\u201310 shows the typi-\ncal constituents of the TME.\nOverall, it is important to note that tumors are not simply\na collection of cancer cells. They are comprised of a variety of\ndifferent types of cells, and consist of both transformed and\nnontransformed cells. Understanding the complex interactions\nbetween these cells and their microenvironment is an impor-\ntant aspect of ongoing cancer research.\nCANCER CELLS EXHIBIT ALTERED\nMET\nABOLIC PROGRAMMING\nIn order to survive, and ultimately grow and proliferate to form\na \ntumor mass, tumor cells must develop the ability to procure all\nnecessary nutrients from typically hypoxic and nutrient-poor\nenvironments. Given these immutable facts, it is not surpris-\ning that multiple transcriptomic (RNA-seq) studies have shown\nthat genes that code for proteins involved in nutrient capture,\nuptake, and metabolism are often mutated, and/or over-/under-\nexpressed in different types of tumors. These observations have\nreinvigorated research into metabolism in general, and in\ncancer cells in particular.TABLE 56\u221210 Summary of Some Important Features of\nApoptosis\n\u2022It involves a genetically programmed series of events and differs\nfrom necrosis, which is a result of direct cellular damage.\n\u2022The series of cellular events involved is a cascade, similar to the\nprocess of blood coagulation.\n\u2022It is characterized by cell shrinking, membrane blebbing, absence\nof inflammation, and a distinct electrophoresis pattern (laddering)\nof degraded DNA.\n\u2022Many caspases (proteinases) are involved; some are initiators and\nothers act as effectors (executioners).\n\u2022Apoptosis can occur either by extrinsic (death receptor\u2212mediated)\nor intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways.\n\u2022FAS and other receptors are involved in the extrinsic pathway of\napoptosis.\n\u2022Cellular stress and other factors activate the intrinsic (mitochondrial)\npathway of apoptosis; release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm is\nan important event in this pathway.\n\u2022Apoptosis is regulated by a balance between inhibitors (antiapoptotic\nfactors) and activators (pro-apoptotic factors) of the process.\n\u2022Acquired mutations found in cancer cells enable them to evade\napoptosis, thus promoting cell proliferation."

            "Text": "704 SECTION XI Special Topics (C)\nGlucose and the amino acid glutamine are two of the\nmost ab\nundant metabolites in plasma. Together, they account\nfor much of the carbon and nitrogen metabolism in human\ncells. In 1924, the biochemist Otto Warburg and his colleagues\nmade the discovery that cancer cells take up large amounts\nof glucose and metabolize it via glycolysis to lactic acid, even\nin the presence of oxygen. This observation was termed the\nWarburg effect . Based on these data, Warburg proposed two\nhypotheses: first, that such an increased ratio of anaerobic\nglycolysis to aerobic respiration in cancer cells was likely to\nbe due to defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain;\nand second, that enhanced rates of glycolysis enabled cancer\ncells to preferentially proliferate in an environment of reduced\noxygen tension often seen in tumors. Furthermore, Warburg\nargued that the switch from aerobic to anaerobic glucose\nmetabolism was a/the driver of tumorigenesis.\nIt is now thought that the reprogramming of mitochon-\ndrial respiration typically observed in tumor cells is a direct\neffect of at least two kinds of influences, rather than to overt\ndefects in mitochondria. The first of these is the self-sustain-\ning signaling by growth factors that characterizes cancer cells,\nwhich causes increased cellular proliferation (Figures 56\u20131\nand 56\u20132). The second of these are the genetic changes in spe-\ncific metabolic enzyme-encoding genes, metabolite transport-\ners, and other related genes. These genetic alterations include\npreferential expression of certain mRNA splice variants,\namplification of particular enzyme-encoding genes, as well\nas altered catalytic efficiencies and specificities and metabolicproducts. Collectively, the resulting changes elicit important\nmetabolic rewiring as well as epigenetic changes in the activity\nof the transcription machinery (ie, DNA and protein methyla-\ntion, acetylation, and other posttranslational modifications)\nthat lead to more efficient cellular anabolism and alteration\nof the TME, which in toto facilitates tumor cell proliferation.\nAn example of tumor cell\u2013specific metabolic rewiring can\nbe illustrated by the example of pyruvate kinase. There are two\nisozymes, PKM1 and PKM2, which are encoded by the glyco-\nlytic pyruvate kinase muscle gene, PKM . These are generated\nby alternative splicing (see Chapter 38). Unlike PKM1, which\nis expressed constitutively in normal cells, PKM2 is often more\nhighly expressed in cancer cells. More likely to be important\nthough is the fact that PKM2 exists in either a dimeric form\nthat exhibits very low catalytic activity, or a tetrameric form,\nwith high catalytic activity. PKM2 in cancer cells is most often\nin the low-activity dimeric form, which results in the accumu-\nlation of glycolytic intermediates. These intermediates allow\ncancer cells to synthesize macromolecules that support rapid\nproliferation (as proposed in the original Warburg hypothesis).\nSuch metabolic enzyme reprogramming ultimately leads\nto less shuttling of glucose-derived chemical energy into\nthe production of ATP ( Figure 56\u201311 ), with a concomitant\nshunting of such energy into building up the cellular biomass\nof proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, etc. These macromolecules\nare essential for cell proliferation (in this case, proliferation\nof cancer cells). Collectively, these observations help explain\nwhy a high rate of glycolysis confers a selective advantageFIGURE 56\u201310 The tumor microenvironment contributes critically to tumor cell growth. Each cell type depicted affects the tumor by\nsecreting factors that stimulate the formation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and helping maintain the already formed CSCs in the stem cell state.\nSummarized here are some of the major cell types and their secreted factors, listed by cell type, that are known to have an impact on CSCs and\ncancer cells.

Based on such observations, a current promis-\ning approach is to analyze blood and urine samples to look for\nalterations in metabolite profiles that may help detect cancer\nat an early stage and to classify them. Such metabolic profiling\ncan be achieved by combining mass spectrometry (MS) with\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. While MS\ncan analyze thousands of metabolites in a sample with high\nsensitivity, NMR spectroscopy can accurately quantitate these\nmetabolites in a highly reproducible manner.\nSolid tumors typically have localized areas of poor bloo\ue033\nsupply and, as noted earlier, preferentially utilize glycolytic\nmetabolism and thus secrete lactic acid into the TME, which\nleads to local aci\ue033osis . It has been postulated that local TME\nacidosis allows tumor cells to invade tissues easily. Hypoxia , orlow oxygen tension (partial pressure of O2; pO2) in areas of\ntumors\n with poor blood supply stimulates the expression of\nhypoxia-in\ue033ucible factor-1 (HIF-1 ). This transcription factor,\nwhich is activated by low partial pressure of oxygen, upregu-\nlates (among other actions) transcription of at least eight genes\nthat control synthesis of enzymes involved in glycolysis.\nThe pH and pO2in tumors are important factors that\naffect responses to anticancer drugs and other treatments. For\nexample, the anticancer efficacy of radiation treatment of can-\ncers is significantly lower in hypoxic conditions. Chemicals\nhave been developed to inhibit glycolysis in tumor cells, and\nperhaps selectively kill them ( Table 56\u201311 ).

However, so far, none\nof these have been found to be clinically useful.\nSTEM CELLS IN CANCER\nStem cells were discussed briefly in Chapters 39 and 53. Much\nwork is cur\nrently ongoing to investigate the role of stem cells\nin cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are believed to harbor\nmutations that, either by themselves or in combination with\nfurther mutations, make these cells potentially cancerous.\nCSCs can be detected by the use of specific surface markers, or\nother techniques. It appears that surrounding tissues (eg, com-\nponents of the extracellular matrix of the TME) significantly\ninfluence the behavior of these cells (see Figure 56\u201310). An\nimportant concept driving some of the research in this area is\nthe belief that one of the reasons that cancer chemotherapy is\noften not successful is that a pool of localize\ue033 an\ue033/or \ue033is-\nseminate\ue033 cancer stem cells exist that are not susceptible to\nconventional chemotherapy. Reasons for this include the\nfacts that many stem cells are relatively dormant, have active\nDNA repair systems (see Figure 35\u201323), express drug trans-\nporters that can expel anticancer drugs, and are often resistant\nto apoptosis.\nEvidence is accumulating that cancer stem cells do indeed\nplay key roles in many types of neoplasia. If so, development of\ntherapies with high specificity for killing these stem cells will\nbe of considerable value.\nTUMORS OFTEN STIMULATE\nANGIOGENESIS\nAs with normal cells, tissues and organs, tumor cells need an\nadequate blood supply to pro\nvide nutrients for their survival.\nBoth tumor cells and cells in tissues surrounding tumors have\nbeen found to secrete angiogenic factors that stimulate the\ngrowth of new blood vessels. There has been much interest in\ntumor angiogenesis, because inhibiting this process represents\na potential means of killing tumor cells.The growth of blood vessels that supply tumor cells can be\nstimulated by hypoxia and other factors. As mentioned earlier,\nhypoxia induces HIF-1, which in turn increases levels of vas-\ncular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a family of proteins\nthat serve as major stimulators of angiogenesis. VEGF proteins\ninteract with specific tyrosine kinase receptors on endothelial\nand lymphatic cells. These interactions activate intracellular sig-\nnaling pathways that cause upregulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway\n(see Chapter 42), resulting in proliferation of endothelial cells\nand formation of new blood vessels. Blood vessels supplying\ntumors are not normal; their structure is often disorganized,\nwith lower than normal levels of integrity. Consequently,\nthey are often leakier than normal blood vessels. Additional\nfactors other than VEGFs, such as angiopoietin ,\u03b2-fibroblast\ngrowth factor (\u03b2-FGF) ,TGF-\u03b2 , and placental growth factor\n(PlGF ), also stimulate angiogenesis. Not surprisingly there are\nother factors that inhibit blood vessel growth (eg, arresten and\nen\ue033ostatin ).\nMonoclonal antibo\ue033ies (mAbs) to one form of VEGF\nhave been developed (eg, bevacizumab or Avastatin) and have\nbeen used in the treatment of certain types of cancer (eg, colon\nand breast). These mAbs bind to VEGF and block it from acting,\npresumably by blocking VEGF from interacting with the VEGF\nreceptor. These therapeutic mAbs were found to increase patient\nsurvival, but most patients eventually relapsed. As with many\nantineoplastic therapies, it is now believed that these mAbs\nare best used in combination with other anticancer therapies.\nMonoclonal antibodies to other growth factors that stimulate\nangiogenesis are also being developed and are in clinical trials,\nas are small molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis. Inhibitors\nof angiogenesis are also useful in other conditions, such as\n\u201cwet, \u201d or age-related, macular \ue033egeneration and\ue033iabetic ret-\ninopathy, in which proliferation of blood vessels is a feature.\nMETASTASIS IS THE MOST\nSERIOUS \nASPECT OF CANCER\nIt has been estimated that about 85% of the mortality associ-\nated with cancer results from metastasis . Spread of cancer is\nusually via lymphatics or blood vessels. Metastasis is a com-\nplex process, the molecular mechanisms of which are only\nnow beginning to be understood.\nFigure 56\u201312 presents a simplified scheme of metastasis.\nThe earliest event is \ue033etachment of tumor cells from the pri-\nmary tumor. The cells can then gain access to the circulation\n(or lymphatics), a process termed intravasation . Once in the\ncirculation, they tend to arrest in the nearest small capillary\nbed. In that site, they extravasate andmigrate through the\nneighboring extracellular matrix (ECM) , before finding a site\nto settle. Thereafter, if they survive host defense mechanisms,\nextravasated cells proliferate and tumors can grow at variable\nrates. To ensure growth, metastatic cells need an adequate\nblood supply, as discussed earlier.\nMany studies have shown that cancer cells have an abnor-\nmal complement of proteins on their surfaces. These changesTABLE 56\u221211 Some Compounds That Inhibit Glycolysis\n& \nHave Been Found to Display Variable Anticancer\nActivity\nCompound Enzyme Inhibited\n3-Bromopyruvat\ne Hexokinase II\n2-Deoxy- d-glucose Hexokinase I\nDichloroacetate\nPyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH)\nIodoacetate Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase\nNote: The rationale for development of these agents is that glycolysis is usually much\nmore active in tumor cells, so that inhibiting it may damage them more than normal\ncells.

            "Text": "708 SECTION XI Special Topics (C)\nAnother important property of many cancer cells is that\nthey \ncan release various proteinases into the ECM. Of the four\nmajor classes of proteinases (serine, cysteine, aspartate, and\nmetalloproteinases), in cancer, particular interest has focused\non the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs ). The MMPs consti-\ntute a large family of metal-dependent (usually zinc) enzymes.\nA number of studies have shown increased activity of MMPs,\nsuch as MMP-2 and MMP-9 (also known as gelatinases), in\ntumors. These enzymes are capable of degrading proteins,\nsuch as collagen, in the basement membrane and in the ECM,\nthereby facilitating the spread of tumor cells. Inhibitors of\nthese enzymes have been developed, but so far these have not\nexhibited much clinical success.\nAnother factor that allows increased movement of cancer\ncells is the molecular process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition , orEMT. The EMT involves a change of cell mor-\nphology and function from epithelial to mesenchymal type,\nlikely induced by the cellular environment. Mesenchymal cell\ntypes have more actin filaments, permitting increased move-\nment, an essential property of cells that metastasize.\nThe ECM also plays an important role in metastasis.\nThere is evidence of communication by signaling mechanisms\nbetween cancer cells and those of the ECM. The types of cells\nin the ECM can also affect metastasis. As mentioned earlier,\nproteinases that degrade proteins in the ECM can facilitate\nspread of cancer cells. In addition, the ECM contains various\ngrowth factors that can influence tumor behavior.\nOn their travels, tumor cells are exposed to various cells\nof the immune system (such as T cells, NK cells, and macro-\nphages; see Chapter 54), and must be able to survive expo-\nsure to them. Some of these immune surveillance cells secrete\nvarious chemokines , small proteins that can attract various\ncells such as leukocytes, sometimes causing an inflammatory\nresponse to tumor cells.\nIt has been estimated that significantly fewer than 1 in\n10,000 cancer cells may have the genetic capacity to success-\nfully colonize (metastasize). Certain tumor cells show a pre-\ndilection to metastasize to specific organs (eg, prostate tumor\ncells to bone; breast tumor cells to bone and brain). It is likely\nthat specific cell surface molecules are involved in this tropism.\nVarious studies have shown that certain genes enhance\nmetastasis, whereas others act as metastasis suppressor genes.\nDetermining exactly how these genes work is the subject of\nintense investigation. Table 56\u201313 summarizes some impor-\ntant points regarding metastasis.THERE ARE MANY IMMUNOLOGIC\nASPECTS \nOF CANCER\nTumor immunology is a broad area of study. Hence, due to the\nexten\nsive breadth of this field, it can only be dealt with here\nbriefly. It is likely that the normal decline in immune respon-\nsiveness that accompanies aging plays a role in the increased\nincidence of cancer in older people. A longstanding hope of\nmolecular oncologists and physicians has been to harness the\nexquisite specificity of the immune system to selectively kill\ncancer cells. There are many ongoing clinical trials investigat-\ning this possibility. These studies involve the use of antibodies,\nvaccines, and various types of T cells that have been genetically\nmanipulated to increase their ability to kill neoplastic cells. One\nof the methods proven to be effective is the use of antibodies\nagainst certain T-lymphocyte surface proteins. For example,\nantibodies developed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen\n4 (anti-CTLA-4) or programmed death 1 (anti-PD1) have been\nshown to \u201cremove the brakes\u201d on these cells, thus setting them\nfree to attack cancer cells.\nOther strategies using modified T cells have proven to be\neffective as well. This approach is termed CAR-T cell therapy .\nWith CAR-T, a patient\u2019s own T cells are harvested, grown, and\nexpanded in culture, and subsequently engineered in vitro to\nexpress specific receptors ( calle\ue033 chimeric antigen receptors\nor CAR ) that can bind to antigens specifically expressed on\ntumor cells. Following reinfusion into the same patient, these\ngenetically modified CAR\u2013T cells bind and kill the targeted\nlymphoblastic leukemia cells. This approach is especially valu-\nable in cases in which conventional chemotherapy had failed.\nMany other CAR-T cell therapies are under development and\nis likely that this approach will revolutionize treatment for\nmany cancers for which treatment options are limited. The\nmajor advantage of immunotherapy is that it has a broad spec-\ntrum of action and therefore can be used against a wide variety\nof cancers. In addition, resistance is less likely to occur with\nthis form of treatment. It is hoped that immunotherapy will beTABLE 56\u221212 Some Important Cell Adhesion Molecules\n(CAMs)\n\u2022Cadherins\n\u2022ICAMS, \nIntercellular adhesion molecules\n\u2022Integrins\n\u2022Selectins\nNote: CAMs may be homophilic or heterophilic.

There is evidence that it can pre\ue033ispose to cancer ;\nfor example, the incidence of colorectal cancer is much higher\nin individuals who have had long-standing ulcerative colitis\nthan in those without this condition. Some inflammatory cells\nproduce relatively large amounts of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) , which can cause damage to DNA and other macro-\nmolecules (see Chapter 57), and perhaps contribute to onco-\ngenesis. It has also been reported that low \ue033oses of aspirin\nmay lower the risk of development of colorectal cancer, perhaps\nvia its anti-inflammatory action.\nCancer: Its Relationship to\nInflammation \n& Obesity\nThe association between inflammation and cancer is now well\nestablished. \nInflammation is known to be a critical component\nof tumorigenesis. That said, the exact mechanisms linking\ninflammation and cancer are poorly understood. Examples of\npossible molecules that are involved in induction of an inflam-\nmatory process include nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and\nsignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).\nNF-\u03baB is a transcription factor that induces expression of pro-\nteins that are involved in proinflammatory, proliferative, and\nreparative processes. Activation of NF-\u03baB has been shown\nto occur in tumors in response to inflammatory stimuli or\noncogenic mutations (see Chapter 42). Signaling via STAT3\nis activated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkine that activates Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling and its\ndownstream effects (see Chapter 42). Such events are thought\nto be responsible for driving many hallmark features of cancer.\nIn addition, the \u201c inflammasome , \u201d a multi-protein complex\nthat acts as a sensor of cellular damage, is another potential\ncandidate that mediates inflammation. Activation of inflam-\nmasomes leads to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines ,\nsuch as IL-1\u03b2 andIL-18 , both of which have been implicated\nin tumorigenesis. There is a large body of evidence to implicate\nother inflammatory mediators in the development of tumors.\nObesity is associated with low-grade inflammation. Vis-\nceral adipose tissue is considered an important source of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines. It is now known that the microenvi-\nronment surrounding tumor cells influences tumorigenesis (see\nearlier). Inflammatory cells in the TME are considered to play\na crucial role in the process. Obesity has been found to medi-\nate and exacerbate dysfunctional changes in the microenviron-\nment; this has been shown to occur both in normal tissue and\ntumors. Such changes include alterations in factors that may be\nendocrine, metabolic, or inflammatory in nature. By contrast,\ncaloric restriction has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis\n(and even longevity; Chapter 57) in experimental models. Many\ncellular pathways, such as those involving growth factor signaling,\ninflammation, cellular homeostasis, and the TME are affected by\nsuch caloric restriction. These observations suggest that such tar-\ngets may be considered for prevention of cancer in humans.TUMOR BIOMARKERS CAN BE\nMEASURED \nIN SAMPLES OF\nBLOOD & OTHER BODY FLUIDS\nBiochemical tests are often helpful in the management of\npatients \nwith cancer (eg, some patients with advanced cancers\nmay have elevated levels of plasma calcium, which can cause\nserious problems if not attended to). Many cancers are associ-\nated with the abnormal production of enzymes, proteins, and\nhormones that can be measured in plasma or serum. These\nmolecules are known as tumor biomarkers . Some of them are\nlisted in Table 56\u201314 .\nHowever, significant elevations of some of the biomarkers\nlisted in Table 56\u201314 also occur in a variety of non-cancerous\ncon\ue033itions . For example, elevations of the level of prostate-\nspecific antigen (PSA), a glycoprotein synthesized by prostate\ncells, occur not only in patients with cancer of the prostate, but\nalso in patients with prostatitis and benign prostatic hyper-\nplasia (BPH ). Similarly, elevations of carcinoembryonic anti-\ngen(CEA ) are found not only in patients with various types\nof cancer, but also in heavy smokers and people with ulcer-\native colitis and cirrhosis. The fact that elevations of tumor\nbiomarkers are usually not specific for cancer has meant that\nmeasurements of most of them are not used primarily for diag-\nnosis of cancer. Their main uses have been in following the\neffectiveness of treatments and in detecting early recurrences.\nAs with other laboratory tests (see Chapter 48), the clinical\npicture must be considered when interpreting the results of\nmeasurements of tumor biomarkers.\nIt is hoped that ongoing -omic analyses of body fluids and\naccessible cancer cells (in blood, serum, and biopsy samples)\nwill provide new prognostic tumor biomarkers of increased\nTABLE 56\u221214 Some Useful Tumor Biomarkers Measur-\nable \nin Blood\nTumor Biomarker Associated Cancer\n\u03b1-Fet\noprotein (AFP) Hepatocellular carcinoma, germ\ncell tumor\nCalcitonin (CT) Thyroid (medullary carcinoma)\nCarcinoembryonic antigen\n(CEA)Colon, lung, breast, pancreas,\novary\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin\n(hCG)Trophoblastic disease, germ cell\ntumor\nMonoclonal immunoglobulin Myeloma\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) Prostate\nCA-125 Ovary\nCA 19-9 Pancreas\nNote: Most of these tumor biomarkers are also elevated in the blood of patients with\nnoncancerous diseases. For example, CEA is elevated in a variety of noncancerous\ngastrointestinal disorders, and PSA is elevated in prostatitis and benign prostatic\nhyperplasia. This is why interpretation of elevated results of tumor markers must be\nmade with caution and their main uses are to follow effectiveness of treatments and\nto detect recurrences. There are a number of other tumor biomarkers that are widely\nused."

A new class of tumor markers that is receiving a lot of\nattention is called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) . ctDNA\nrefers to DNA derived from cancers, which can be isolated\nfrom blood. Since DNA from different cancers harbor charac-\nteristic mutations, identification of these mutations can indi-\ncate the presence and type of cancer, even when conventional\nbiopsies are not possible. It is hoped that these tests (called\nliquid biopsies) can help in early diagnosis of cancers, suggest\npersonalized therapies, and aid in early detection of relapses.\nNote the similarity in basic approach to analysis of stool samples\nto detect genetic changes in DNA from sloughed intestinal\nepithelial cells to diagnose colon cancer as described earlier.\nTranscriptome and whole genome sequencing analyses\n(see Chapter 39 and following discussion) of cancer cells have\nrevealed a plethora of potentially very useful biomarkers of\noncogenesis. These methods are also useful in more accurately\nsubclassifying tumors (so-called \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d;\nsee Chapter 39) in order to provide more accurate diagnoses\nand guide more efficacious, targeted modes of therapy. Such\nmolecular diagnostic methods are becoming the standard of\ncare for a select subset of cancers.\nDETAILED GENETIC ANALYSES OF\nTUMOR \nCELLS IS PROVIDING NEW\nINSIGHTS INTO CANCER\nSince the completion of the Human Genome Project, the\ntec\nhnology of large-scale DNA sequencing and bioinformatic\nanalyses and interpretation of sequence data has advanced con-\nsiderably. Large-scale DNA sequencing has become both faster\nand cheaper with the widespread availability of various high-\nthroughput DNA sequencing technologies (see Chapter 39).\nThese advances have allowed for analyses of DNA sequences\nof a large number of different types of tumors. Recently, world-\nwide teams of scientists affiliated with The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) , and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole\nGenomes Consortium (PCAWG) have published and orga-\nnized the results of integrated DNA- and RNA-sequencing\nanalyses where both DNA genomes and RNA exomes (the\nsequence and quantification of the complete collection of RNA\nspecies expressed in cells) of thousands of tumors and matched\nnoncancerous cells derived from dozens of different types of\ntissues. These scientists are using this information to uncover\nimportant new information regarding the mechanisms of\noncogenesis. The resulting comprehensive catalogs of data\nfrom the PCAWG and TCGA consortia (and other efforts)\nregarding specific types, numbers, and effects of specific gene\nmutations in different cancers is revolutionizing \ue033iagnostic\ntesting and the development of custom-tailore\ue033 therapy .\nCRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats), a system originally discovered as a form of adaptive\nimmunity in bacteria, has been transformed into a versatile\nand precise gene-editing tool (see Figure 39\u20132). CRISPR isa protein-RNA complex composed of a gui\ue033e RNA (gRNA )\nand an endonuclease called Cas (Cas9 is commonly used).\nInside a cell, the gRNA targets Cas to a specific segment of\nDNA that is complementary to its sequence. On binding, Cas\ncan either degrade the segment of DNA (thus knocking out a\ngene, for example), or edit it precisely to incorporate desired\nchanges in the DNA sequence. CRISPR technology has been\nused to develop new cancer treatments. Recently, the CRISPR\napproach was used to engineer T cells (called NYCE T cells),\nin which three genes were precisely edited, thus enabling it to\nbetter recognize and kill tumor cells that expressed a protein,\nNY-ESO-1.\nAs noted earlier, tumors often exhibit extreme heteroge-\nneity, such that they consist of subpopulations of cells that\nare genetically and phenotypically distinct from one another\n(see Figure 56\u201310). It is now possible to isolate and sequence\nthe nucleic acids of single cells obtained from tumors ( single-\ncell sequencing ), in order to understand the genetic landscape\nof a particular tumor. Such understanding is important to\nallow for the development of multimodal treatment strategies\nthat efficiently target all the subpopulations in a given tumor.\nOverall, it is expected that information obtained from\nthese new technologies will dramatically impact the next stages\nof cancer genomics and help in development of methods that\nallow for earlier diagnosis of cancer, identification of critical\ngenetic changes that drive cancer progression and, ultimately,\npersonalized therapy for cancer in individual patients. Such an\nindividualized approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment is\ntermed precision oncology .\nKNOWLEDGE OF MECHANISMS\nINVOL\nVED IN CARCINOGENESIS\nHAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT\nOF NEW THERAPIES\nOne of the great hopes of cancer research is that insights into\nfundamental \nbiochemical and genetic mechanisms involved\nin carcinogenesis will lead to new and better therapies. This\nhas already occurred to a certain extent and it is hoped that\nongoing developments will accelerate this process.\nClassical chemotherapeutic drugs include alkylating agents,\nplatinum complexes, antimetabolites, and mitotic spindle\npoisons, among other classes of chemical compounds. These\nagents will not be discussed here. Within the classes of drugs\ndeveloped more recently are inhibitors of signal transduction\n(including tyrosine kinase inhibitors), monoclonal antibodies\ndirected to various target molecules, inhibitors of hormone\nreceptors, drugs that affect differentiation, anti-angiogenesis\nagents, and biologic response modifiers. Examples of each of\nthese are listed in Table 56\u201315 .\nThe finding of widespread defects in signaling mechanisms\nin cancer cells, and in particular the detection of mutations in\ntyrosine kinases , has led to the development of inhibitors of\nthese enzymes. The most dramatic success has probably been\nthe introduction of imatinib (marketed as Gleevec) for the"

Imatinib\nis an orally administered drug that inhibits the tyrosine kinase\nformed due to the ABL-BCR chromosomal translocation that\nis involved in the genesis of CML. It is an ATP analog that\ncompetitively binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase.\nTreatment with this drug has produced complete remission\nof disease in many patients. Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors\ninclude erlotinib and gefitinib, which inhibit the epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is overexpressed in\ncertain lung (eg, non\u2013small cell cancers) and breast cancers,\nresulting in aberrant (constitutive) signaling. It is important\nto appreciate that the design of such drugs requires detailed\nstructural knowledge, such as that provided by x-ray crystal-\nlography, NMR studies, and model building of the molecules\nbeing targeted. Another class of useful drugs is monoclonal\nantibo\ue033ies to various molecules exposed on the surfaces of neo-\nplastic cells (see discussion earlier regarding anti-VEGF mAb).\nA few of these mAbs that are clinically useful as therapeutic\nagents are listed in Table 56\u201315.\nOther approaches to treating cancer that are in use or being\ndeveloped, but are not listed in Table 56\u201315, include various typesofgene therapy (including siRNAs, see Chapter 34), immuno-\ntherapy (described earlier), oncolytic viruses (viruses that pref-\nerentially infect and replicate in tumor cells, ultimately leading to\ntumor cell death via several mechanisms), inhibitors of steroi\ue033\nhormone receptors, aromatase inhibitors (see Chapter 41)\n(for some breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers), telomerase\ninhibitors , applications of nanotechnology (eg, nanoshells\nand other nanoparticles), phototherapy (see Chapter 31), and\ndrugs that selectively target cancer stem cells .\nIt is important to appreciate that anticancer drugs have\nside effects, like all other therapeutic agents. Sometimes, these\nare severe. Moreover, resistance to many drugs can develop\nafter variable periods of time, as a result of therapy-driven/\nselected genetic changes in tumor cells.\nThe study of mechanisms by which cancer cells develop\nresistance to drugs is an important area of research. Cancer\ncells use a number of strategies to develop drug resistance\n(see summary, Table 56\u201316 ). The overall thrust of drug devel-\nopment for cancer therapy is to use new information that\nemerges from studies of basic immunology, biochemistry, and\ncellular, molecular, and cancer biology to develop safer andTABLE 56\u221215 Some Anticancer Agents That Are Based on Recent Advances in Knowledge of Cancer Biology\nClass Example Used to Treat\nInhibitors \nof signal transduction Imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase Chronic myelocytic leukemia\nMonoclonal antibodies Trastuzumab, an mAb to the HER2/Neu receptor Late-stage breast cancer\nAntiangiogenesis agents Bevacizumab, an mAb to VEGF A Colon and breast cancers\nAntihormonal agents Tamoxifen, antagonist of the estrogen receptor Breast cancer\nAffect differentiation All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), targets the retinoic acid receptor\non promyelocytic leukemia cells, causing them to differentiatePromyelocytic leukemia\nAffect epigenetic changes 5-Azadeoxycytidine inhibits DNA methyltransferases; SAHA\ninhibits histone deacetylasesCertain leukemias, cutaneous T-cell\nlymphoma\nAbbreviations: Chronic myelocytic leukemia; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SAHA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat); VEGF A, vascular endothelial growth factor A.\nNote: In some cases, the above agents may have been replaced by other more effective agents.

Intensive research over the past several\ndecades has \nresulted in an improved understanding of genetic\nalterations that underlie the development of specific types\nof cancer. This knowledge has led to a shift from the use of\nbroad-spectrum cytotoxic drugs to therapies that are specifi-\ncally designed to target individual tumors. Currently, a major\narea of research is to identify specific driver mutations, that is,\nthe genetic changes that play critical roles in development of\ntumors (see discussion of colorectal cancer earlier). Molecular\nprofiling of cancer in individual patients allows oncologists\nto choose the most appropriate drug or treatment modality\nthat targets the molecular abnormality in each tumor, while\nsimultaneously allowing for monitoring the efficacy of such\ntreatment(s) over time. Such personalize\ue033 anticancer therapy\nhas been shown to significantly improve clinical response to\ndrugs and increase survival in various types of cancer. An\nunderstanding of individuals\u2019 genetic differences in metabo-\nlism of anticancer drugs may also help personalize anticancer\ntreatments.\nFigure 56\u201313 summarizes some of the targets for drug\ntherapy and some emerging therapies that have developed\nfrom studies of fundamental aspects of cancer.\nMANY CANCERS CAN BE\nPREVENTED\nThe tremendous individual suffering caused by cancer, and\nthe \nheavy economic burden it imposes on society, makes it\nimportant to adopt measures to prevent the \ue033evelopment of\ncancer .Mo\ue033ifiable risk factors have been linked to a wide\nvariety of cancers. It is likely that a significant number of\nall cancers in developed countries may be prevented, if the\nmeasures summarized in Table 56\u201317 are introduced on a\npopulation-wide basis.\nThe use of tobacco, in its various forms, continues to be\na major cause of cancer affecting the lungs, mouth, larynx,esophagus, and stomach. A sustained public education cam-\npaign regarding the adverse effects of tobacco use has resulted\nin significant decreases in the incidence of cancers associated\nwith tobacco use. Vaccines against the human papillomavirus\n(HPV) (known to be associated with cancer of the cervix)\nand hepatitis B virus (HBV) (associated with hepatocellular\ncarcinoma) have been found to be effective in decreasing the\nincidence of cancers caused by these viruses.\nChemoprevention, which refers to the use of drugs to pre-\nvent the development of cancer, has been found to be effective\nin certain types of cancer. For example, the use of estrogen\nreceptor modulators (like tamoxifen) has been shown to\ndecrease the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women by\nabout 50%. Similarly, the use of finasteride (a drug that inhib-\nits the enzyme, 5\u03b1-reductase, that converts testosterone to\ndihydrotestosterone), has been associated with reduced inci-\ndence of prostate cancer. It has also been shown that long-term\nuse of aspirin, which is commonly prescribed as an antiplatelet\nagent, is associated with decreased incidence of colon cancer.\nIn some instances, identification of genetic risk factors for\ncancer is opening up possibilities for newer strategies in can-\ncer prevention. For example, women who have mutations in\nthe breast-cancer associated genes, BRCA1 andBRCA2 , can\nundergo prophylactic mastectomy (surgery for removal of\nthe breast) in order to mitigate any future risk of developing\ncancer.\nOverall, the rapid progression of research in cancer biol-\nogy is not only opening up newer ways to treat cancer, but also\nto decrease and/or prevent the occurrence of the disease in the\nfirst place.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Cancer is caused by mutations in genes that control cell\ngrowth \nand duplication, cell death (apoptosis), and cell-cell\ninteractions (eg, cell adhesion). Other important aspects of\ncancer are defects in cell signaling pathways, stimulation of\nangiogenesis, aneuploidy, and changes in cellular metabolism\nand cell microenvironment.\n\u25a0A majority of cancers are likely due to replicative errors (as\nbroadly \ndefined) that affect somatic cells.

Adenomas are often polypoid.\nA polyp is a growth that protrudes from a mucous membrane;\nmost are benign, but some polyps can become malignant.\nAmes assay: An assay system devised by Dr. Bruce Ames that uses\na specially designed Salmonella typhimurium strain to detect\nmutagens. Most carcinogens are mutagens, but if mutagenicity of\na chemical is detected, ideally such chemical compounds should\nbe tested for carcinogenicity by animal testing.\nAneuploi\ue033y: Refers to any condition in which the chromosome\nnumber of a cell is not an exact multiple of the basic haploid\nnumber. Aneuploidy is found in many tumor cells and may play\na fundamental role in the development of cancer.\nAngiogenesis: The formation of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis\nis often active around tumor cells, ensuring that they obtain an\nadequate blood supply. A number of growth factors are secreted\nby tumors and surrounding cells (eg, vascular endothelial growth\nfactor, or VEGF) and are involved in this process.\nApoptosis: Cell death due to activation of a genetic program\nthat causes fragmentation of cellular DNA and other changes.\nCaspases play a central role in the process. Many positive and\nnegative regulators affect it. The protein p53 induces apoptosis\nas a response to cell DNA damage. Most cancer cells exhibit\nabnormalities of apoptosis, due to various mutations that help to\nensure their prolonged survival.\nBenign tumor: A mass of abnormal proliferating cells, which are\nnoninvasive and do not metastasize.\nBiologic response mo\ue033ifiers: Molecules produced by the body\nor in the laboratory, which when administered to patients\nalter the body\u2019s response to infection, inflammation, and other\nprocesses. Examples include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines,\ninterleukins, interferons, and growth factors.\nBloom syn\ue033rome: One of the chromosomal instability (CIN)\nsyndromes. Because of mutations in a DNA helicase, subjects are\nsensitive to DNA damage and are at increased risk of developing\ntumors.Burkitt lymphoma: This is a B-cell lymphoma, endemic in parts\nof Africa, where it mainly affects the jaw and facial bones.\nA reciprocal translocation, involving the c-MYC gene on\nchromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on\nchromosome 14, is a characteristic driver of this disease.\nCancer: A tumor consisting of malignant cells\nCancer stem cell: A cell within a tumor that has the capacity to self-\nrenew and to give rise to the heterogeneous lineages of cancer\ncells found in the tumor.\nCarcinogen: Any agent (eg, a chemical or a physical agent) capable\nof causing cells to become cancerous.\nCarcinoma: A malignant growth of epithelial origin. A cancer\nof glandular origin or showing glandular features is usually\ndesignated as an adenocarcinoma.\nCaspases: Proteolytic enzymes that play a central role in apoptosis,\nbut are also involved in other processes. About 15 types are\npresent in humans. Caspases hydrolyze peptide bonds on the\nC-terminal side of aspartate residues.\nCell cycle: The various events pertaining to cell division that occur\nas a cell goes from one mitosis to another.\nCentriole: An array of microtubules that is paired and found in the\ncenter of a centrosome. (Also see Centrosome .)\nCentromere: The constricted region of a mitotic chromosome\nwhere chromatids are joined together. It is in close proximity to\nthe kinetochore. Abnormalities of centromeres may contribute to\nCIN. (Also see Kinetochore. )\nCentrosome: A centrally located organelle that is the primary\nmicrotubule-organizing center of a cell. It acts as the spindle pole\nduring cell division. Both centrosome number and intracellular\nlocation within the cell during cell division are critical for\naccurate cell duplication.\nChromati\ue033: A single chromosome.\nChromatin remo\ue033eling: This involves conformational, or covalent\nchanges of nucleosomes, brought about by the actions of\nmultiprotein complexes (such as the SW1/SNF complex).\nThese changes can alter gene transcription (turning it on or off,\ndepending on specific conditions). Mutations affecting different\nproteins of these complexes are often found in cancer cells. (See\nalsoEpigenetics. )\nChromosomal instability (CIN): Gain or loss of whole\nchromosomes or segments thereof caused by abnormalities of\nchromosome segregation during mitosis. (See also Genome\ninstability andMicrosatellite instability .) There are a number\nof disorders that are named CIN syndromes because they are\nassociated with chromosomal abnormalities. An increased\nincidence of various cancers is found in these conditions.\nChromosomal passenger complex (CPC): A complex of proteins\nthat plays a key role in regulating mitosis by participating\nin chromosome alignment and spindle assembly. Mutations\naffecting CPC proteins may contribute to CIN and aneuploidy.\nChromosomal translocation: When part of one chromosome\nbecomes fused to another, often causing activation of a gene\nat the site. The Philadelphia chromosome (see later) is one of\nmany examples of a chromosomal translocation involved in the\ncausation of cancer (see also Burkitt lymphoma earlier).\nClone: All the cells of a clone are derived from one parent cell.\nCopy number variations (CNVs): V ariations (because of duplications\nor deletions) among individuals as to the number of copies they have\nof particular genes or noncoding DNA.

Mutations found in tumors\nthat do not cause cancer or its progression are called passenger\nmutations.\nEpigenetic: Refers to changes of gene expression without changes\nin the sequence of bases in DNA. Factors causing epigenetic\nchanges include methylation of bases in DNA, posttranslational\nmodifications of histones, and chromatin remodeling.\nFAS receptor: A receptor that initiates apoptosis when it binds\nits ligand, FAS. FAS is a protein present on the surface of\nactivated natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and\nother cells.\nGatekeeper gene: Genes that code for proteins that control or\ninhibit cell growth. Such genes are generally referred to as tumor\nsuppressor genes (eg, P53andRB). Mutation in such genes often\ninitiates the cascade of events that cause oncogenesis.\nGenome instability: This refers to a number of alterations of\nthe genome, of which the two principal ones are CIN and\nmicrosatellite instability. In general, it reflects the fact that the\ngenomes of cancer cells are more susceptible to mutations than\nthose of normal cells, in part due to impairment of DNA repair\nsystems.\nGrowth factors: A variety of polypeptides secreted by many normal\nand tumor cells. These molecules act via autocrine (affects\nthe cells that produce the growth factor), paracrine (affects\nneighboring cells), or endocrine (travels in the blood to affect\ndistant cells) modes. Growth factors stimulate proliferation of\ntarget cells via interactions with specific receptors. They also\nhave many other biologic properties.\nHypoxia-in\ue033ucible factors (HIFs): A family of transcription\nfactors important in directing cellular responses to varying levels\nof oxygen. HIFs are made up of different oxygen-regulated \u03b1\nsubunits and a common constitutive \u03b2 subunit. At physiologic\nlevels of oxygen, the \u03b1 subunit undergoes rapid degradation,\ninitiated by prolyl hydroxylases. HIFs have various functions; for\nexample, HIF-1 upregulates various genes encoding enzymes of\nglycolysis, and also the expression of vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF).\nKinetochore: A structure that forms on each mitotic chromosome\nadjacent to the centromere. Mutations affecting the structures\nof its component proteins could contribute to causing CIN. (See\nalsoCentromere .)\nLeukemias: A variety of malignant diseases in which various white\nblood cells (eg, myeloblasts, lymphoblasts, etc) proliferate in an\nunrestrained manner. Leukemias may be acute or chronic.\nLoss of heterozygosity (LOH): LOH occurs when there is loss of\nthe normal allele (often encoding a tumor suppressor gene) from\na pair of heterozygous chromosomes, allowing the effects of the\ndefective allele to be manifest clinically.\nLymphoma: A group of neoplasms arising in the reticuloendothelial\nand lymphatic systems. Major members of the group are\nHodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.\nMalignant cells: They are cancer cells, which have the ability\nto grow in an unrestrained manner, to invade, and to spread\n(metastasize) to other parts of the body.\nMetastasis: The ability of cancer cells to spread to distant parts of\nthe body and grow there.\nMicrosatellite instability (MSI): Expansion or contraction of\nshort tandem repeats (microsatellites) due to replication\nslippage, abnormalities of mismatch repair or of homologous\nrecombination.Nanotechnology: The development and application of devices that\nare only a few nanometers in size (10\u22129m = 1 nm). Some are\nbeing applied to cancer therapy.\nNecrosis: Cell death induced by chemicals or tissue injury.\nDuring necrosis, a variety of hydrolytic enzymes are released\nthat subsequently digest cellular molecules. Necrosis is not\na genetically programmed process, as is apoptosis. Affected\ncells usually lyse releasing their contents, causing local\ninflammation.\nNeoplasm: Any new growth of tissue, benign or malignant.\nOncogene: A mutated cellular gene (ie, proto-oncogene), the gene\nproduct of which is involved in the transformation of a normal\ncell to a cancer cell.\nOncology: The area of medical science that concerns itself with all\naspects of cancer (causes, diagnosis, treatment, etc).\nOMIM: Online Men\ue033elian Inheritance in Man: An authoritative\nand comprehensive compendium of human genes and genetic\nphenotypes.\nPhila\ue033elphia chromosome: A chromosome formed by a reciprocal\ntranslocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This chromosomal\ntranslocation is the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).\nTo form the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome, part of the BCR\n(breakpoint cluster region) gene of chromosome 22 fuses with\npart of the ABL gene (encodes a tyrosine kinase) of chromosome\n9, directing the synthesis of a chimeric protein that has\nunregulated tyrosine kinase activity that drives cell proliferation.\nThe activity of this kinase is inhibited by the drug imatinib\n(Gleevec), which has been successfully used to treat CML.\n(See also Chromosomal translocation .)\nProcarcinogen: A chemical that becomes a carcinogen when it\nundergoes metabolism in the body.\nProto-oncogene: A normal cellular gene, which when mutated\ncan give rise to a product that stimulates the growth of cells,\ncontributing to the development of cancer.\nReplication slippage: A process in which, because of misalignment\nof DNA strands where repeat sequences occur, DNA polymerase\npauses and dissociates, resulting in deletions or insertions of\nrepeat sequences.\nRetinoblastoma: A rare tumor of the retina. Mutation of the RB\ntumor suppressor gene plays a key role in its development.\nPatients with hereditary retinoblastomas have inherited one\nmutated copy of the RBgene, and only need a mutation in\nthe other copy of the gene to develop the tumor. Patients with\nsporadic retinoblastomas are born with two normal copies, and\nrequire two mutations to inactivate the gene.\nRous sarcoma virus (RSV): An RNA tumor virus that causes\nsarcomas in chickens. It was discovered in 1911 by Peyton\nRous. RSV is a retrovirus that uses a reverse transcriptase in its\nreplication. The resultant DNA copy of its genome subsequently\nintegrates into the host cell genome. RSV has been widely used\nin studies of cancer, which has led to many important findings\nregarding the molecular bases of oncogenic transformation.\nSarcoma: A malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin (eg, from cells\nof the extracellular matrix or other sources).\nTelomeres: Structures at the ends of chromosome that contain\nmultiple repeats of specific hexanucleotide DNA sequences.\nThe telomeres of normal cells shorten on repeated cell division,\nwhich may result in cell death. The enzyme telomerase replicates\ntelomeres and is often expressed in cancer cells, helping them to\nevade cell death. Telomerase levels are extremely low in normal\nsomatic cells."

Adolescence witnesses a final burst of growth in\nthe body\u2019s skeletal framework. More importantly, a series of\ndramatic developmental changes occur\u2014an accumulation\nof muscle mass, maturation of the gonads and brain, and the\nemergence of secondary sex characteristics\u2014that transform a\nchild into an independent and reproductively capable adult.\nAdulthood, the longest stage, is a period devoid of dramatic\nphysical growth or developmental change. With the notable\nexception of pregnancy in females, it is not unusual for adults\nto maintain the same body weight, overall appearance, and\ngeneral level of activity for two or three decades or more.\nBarring fatal illness or injury, the onset of the final stage of\nlife, old age, is signaled by a resurgence of physical and physi-\nologic change. Muscle and bone mass progressively decrease.Hair begins to thin and lose its pigmentation. Skin loses its\nsuppleness and accumulates blemishes. Attention span and\nrecall decline.

Today, 100 years later, the current\nworld average is 67 years, and that for developed nations is\napproaching 80. These dramatic increases have led to specula-\ntion about how long this trend might be expected to continue.\nCan future generations expect to routinely live past the cen-\ntury mark? Is it possible that human beings possess the poten-\ntial, with proper care and maintenance, to live indefinitely?\nUnfortunately, such extrapolations are unlikely to be real-\nized because they are based on a misunderstanding of the term\nlife expectancy . Life expectancy is calculated by averaging\nover all births. Hence, it is dramatically influenced by infant\nmortality rates. While the life expectancy of a Roman child\nwas 25 years, if one calculated the expected lifespan only for\nthose persons who survived infancy, which we will refer to as\nlongevity , the average nearly doubled to 48. When one fac-\ntors out the dramatic decline in infant mortality rates that has\ntaken place over the past century and a half, the predicted lon-\ngevity of a 5-year-old child in the United States has increased\nfrom 70.5 in 1950 to 77.5 years in 2000 ( Table 57\u20131 ). Is there\nsome sort of upper limit to the lifespan of a properly nour-\nished, protected, well-maintained human being?\nAGING & MORTALITY:\nNONSPECIFIC \nOR PROGRAMMED\nPROCESSES?\nAre aging and death non-determinant or stochastic processes\nwherein living creatur\nes inevitably reach a tipping point after\na lifetime\u2019s accumulation of damage from disease, injury, and\nsimple wear and tear? Alternatively, are aging and death genet-\nically programmed processes analogous to puberty that haveevolved through a process of natural selection? In all likeli-\nhood, aging and death are multifactorial processes to which\nboth stochastic and programmed factors contribute.\nWEAR & TEAR THEORIES\nOF \nAGING\nSome researchers theorize that aging and mortality are the inev-\nita\nble outcomes of a lifetime\u2019s accumulation of damage from\ninjury, disease, and exposure to deleterious environmental con-\nstituents such as ultraviolet light. These theories note that while\nrepair and turnover mechanisms exist to restore or replace many\ntypes of damaged molecules, they are less than perfect. Hence,\nsome damage inevitably leaks through\u2014damage that will accu-\nmulate over time, particularly among those cell populations that\nundergo little, if any, turnover ( Table 57\u20132 ). Ironically, many\nprominent sources of molecular and cellular damage also are\nessential for terrestrial life: water, oxygen, and sunlight.\nHydrolytic Reactions Can Damage\nProteins \n& Nucleotides\nWater is a relatively weak nucleophile. However, because of\nits \nubiquity and high concentration (>55 M; see Chapter 2),\neven this weak nucleophile will occasionally react with sus-\nceptible targets inside the cell. These targets include the amide\nbonds that form polypeptide chains and, especially, the side\nchain amides of the amino acids asparagine and glutamine.\nHydrolysis transforms asparagine and glutamine residues into\naspartate and glutamate residues, respectively, thereby intro-\nducing an acidic and potentially negatively charged group in\nplace of a pH- and charge-neutral amide ( Figure 57\u20131A andB).\nBoth the bonds linking nucleotide bases to the deoxyribose-\nphosphodiester backbone of DNA and the amino groups\nprojecting from the heterocyclic aromatic rings of the nucle-\notide bases cytosine, adenine, and guanine are also suscep-\ntible to hydrolytic attack. In the latter case, the amino group is\nreplaced by a carbonyl oxygen to form uracil, hypoxanthine, andTABLE 57\u22121 Average Life Expectancy by Decade, USA\nA verage Life Expectancy (Years)\nSample Period From Birth If Survived to Age 5\n1900-1902 49.24 59.98\n1909-1911 51.49 61.21\n1919-1921 56.40 62.99\n1929-1931 59.20 64.29\n1939-1941 63.62 67.49\n1949-1951 68.07 70.54\n1959-1961 69.89 72.04\n1969-1971 70.75 72.43\n1979-1981 73.88 75.00\n1989-1991 75.37 76.22\n1999-2001 76.83 77.47\nData from Arias E, Curtin LR, Wei R, Anderson RN.

In the former, the nucle-\notide base is completely eliminated, leaving a gap in the sequence\n(Figure 57\u20131D ). The elimination or alteration of nucleotide\nbases in DNA is of potentially much greater biomedical signifi-\ncance than those affecting proteins. If the affected gene encodes\na protein, if left unrepaired (see Chapter 35) every subsequent\ncopy of the protein will be altered, whereas direct damage affects\nonly a single copy of a protein. If the mutant cell divides, the\nalteration will be passed on to its progeny, amplifying its impact.\nOther biologically relevant bonds that are susceptible to\nhydrolysis include the ester linkages that connect fatty acids\nto their cognate glycerolipids, the glucosidic bonds that link\nthe monosaccharide units of carbohydrates, and the phospho-\ndiester bonds that hold polynucleotides together and link the\nhead groups of phospholipids to their diacylglycerol partners.\nIn most instances, with the notable exception of polynucleo-\ntide chain breaks, the products of these reactions appear to be\nbiologically innocuous.\nRespiration Generates Reactive\nOxygen \nSpecies\nNumerous biologic processes require enzyme-catalyzed oxi-\ndation of or\nganic molecules by molecular oxygen (O2).

The most common of these sources is\nthe electron transport chain, whose high levels of electron flux\nand structural complexity render it vulnerable to \u201cleakage\u201d\nof ROS.

The resulting peroxidation\nof lipids can lead to the formation of cross-linked lipid-lipid\nand lipid-protein adducts that may compromise membrane\nfluidity and integrity. In mitochondria, a loss of membrane\nintegrity can potentially allow protons to leak across, thereby\nreducing the efficiency of ATP generation and increasing\nthe production of deleterious ROS. Accumulated damage to\nmitochondrial membranes may eventually lead to the efflux\nof cytochrome c, an inducer of programmed cell death or\napoptosis (see later).Chain Reactions Amplify the\nDestructiveness \nof ROS\nThe destructiveness inherent in the high reactivity of many\nof ROS, particularly those con\ntaining an unpaired electron, is\nexacerbated by their capacity to participate in chain reactions\nin which the product of the reaction may include, not just a\ndamaged biomolecule, but another free radical species capable\nof producing additional damage with the accompanying for-\nmation of yet another free radical by-product. This chain of\nevents will continue until a free radical by-product is able to\nacquire an unpaired electron from another ROS molecule or\na redox protectant such as reduced glutathione. Alternatively,\nthe ROS may be eliminated by the catalytic action of a mem-\nber of the cell\u2019s arsenal of dedicated antioxidant enzymes\n(see Chapters 12 and 53).\nThe reactivity, and hence destructiveness, of individual ROS\nvaries. Hydrogen peroxide, for example, is less reactive than\nsuperoxide, which in turn is less reactive than hydroxyl radical\n(OH\u2022). Two pathways exist by which the highly toxic hydroxyl\nrad\nical can be generated from less destructive ROS in living\norganisms. One is through the Fenton reaction, in which H2O2\nrea\ncts with ferrous (+2) iron to generate a hydroxyl radical along\nwith a hydroxide ion and ferric (+3) iron (see Figure 57\u20132B).\nThe ferric iron, in turn, can be reduced back to the ferrous (+2)\nstate by other hydrogen peroxide molecules, furthering the pro-\nduction of additional hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction.\nHydroxyl radical can also be generated when superoxide and\nhydrogen peroxide disproportionate via the Haber-Weiss reac-\ntion (see Figure 57\u20132C).\nTHE MITOCHONDRIAL THEORY\nOF \nAGING\nMitochondria Are Major Sources of ROS\nIn 1956, Denham Harmon proposed the free radical theory of\nag\ning. It had been suggested that the similarities between the\ntoxic side effects produced on exposure to hyperbaric oxygen\nor ionizing radiation could be traced to a common source, their\nshared propensity for generating ROS. This proposition dovetailed\nnicely with Harmon\u2019s own observation that lifespan was inversely\nrelated to metabolic rate and, by extrapolation, respiration. Since\nall animals respire, free radical theory postulates that aging is a\nreflection of the cumulative biomolecular damage that results\nfrom the continual and inescapable production of ROS.\nThe dominant natural source of cellular ROS is the occa-\nsional escape or leakage of electrons from the electron transport\nchain. As damage to the components of this pathway would be\nexpected to increase the rate of leakage, it is not difficult to\nenvision the emergence of a vicious cycle in which some initial\ninsult to the mitochondria would lead to an increased rate of\nROS production that would, in turn, cause further damage.\nAccumulating damage to mitochondrial components could,\nin turn, adversely affect the production of ATP , perhaps to the\npoint where it undermines cell vitality and function.O2H2O2Hydr ogen peroxide\nOH\u2022Hydr oxyl radical\nNO\u2022Nitric oxide\nROOH Lipid peroxide\nRS\u2022Th yil radical\nHydroxyl radical\nFENTON REACTION\nHydroxyl radical\nHABER-WEISS REACTIONA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 57\u20132 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are toxic by-\npro\nducts of life in an aerobic environment.

The mitochondrial genome\nis a much reduced, vestigial remnant of the genome of the ancient\nbacterium that was the precursor of the current organelle. It\nis presumed that the exchange of metabolites between primi-\ntive eukaryotes and neighboring bacteria developed into a\nmutually dependency. The ultimate outcome of this intimate\nmetabolic integration was endosymbiosis , the internalization\nof the smaller bacterium by its eukaryotic partner. Over time\nmost, but not all, of the genes contained in the genome of the\ninternalized bacterium\u2019s were either eliminated or were trans-\nferred to the nuclear DNA of the eukaryotic host. Today, the\ngenome of the human mitochondrion encodes two ribosomal\nRNAs (one for each subunit), 22 tRNAs, several of the poly-\npeptide components of complexes I, III, and IV of the elec-\ntron transport chain, and parts of F1, F0A TPase ( Table 57\u20133 ).\nThe mitochondrial genome lacks genes encoding the types of\nsurveillance and repair enzymes responsible for maintaining\nthe integrity of nuclear DNA. Hence, when mutations occur,\nincluding those that adversely affect components of the elec-\ntron transport chain, they become a permanent feature of a\nmitochondrion\u2019s genome. Not only do these mutations and\ntheir impacts persist, additional mutations can also accrue over\ntime that further compromise electron transport chain function.\nOne can envision a vicious cycle in which an ROS-generated\nmutation to the mitochondrial genome leads to the increased\nleakage of ROS from the electron chain that in turn cause fur-\nther DNA damage and still higher levels of ROS leakage.\nWhile the mitochondrial hypothesis is no longer viewed as\na comprehensive, unifying explanation for all of the changes that\nare associated with human aging and its comorbidities, this\norganelle remains a likely contributor. It has been observed\nthat levels of the key electron carrier, NAD(H), decline with\nage. In addition, the key part played by mitochondria in pro-\ngrammed cell death (apoptosis) can be viewed as offering cir-\ncumstantial support for mitochondria as drivers of aging and\nmorbidity.Mitochondria Are Key Participants\nin \nApoptosis\nApoptosis imbues higher organisms with the ability to selec-\ntiv\nely eliminate cells that are rendered superfluous by develop-\nmental changes, such as those that continually take place during\nembryogenesis, or which have been damaged beyond repair.\nDuring developmental tissue remodeling, the apoptotic cell\ndeath program is triggered by receptor-mediated signals. In the\ncase of damaged cells, ROS, viral dsRNA, DNA damage, or heat\nshock may act as triggers. These signals induce the opening of\nthe permeability transition pore complex embedded in the mito-\nchondrial outer membrane, which allows cytochrome c, a small\n(\u224812.5 kDa), soluble electron carrier protein, to escape into the\ncytoplasm. Here, cytochrome c provides the core around which\ntheapoptosome , a multiprotein complex, coalesces. Assembly\nof the apoptosome initiates a cascade of proteolytic activation\nevents targeting the proenzyme forms of the caspases, a family\nof cysteine proteases. The terminal caspases, numbers 3 and 7,\nbreak down structural proteins in the cytoplasm and chroma-\ntin proteins in the nucleus; events that lead to the death and,\neventually, phagocytosis of the morbid cell. Many researchers\nare working to find ways to exploit the presence of this intrinsic,\nreceptor-mediated cell death pathway as a means for selectively\neliminating cancer and other malicious cells.\nUltraviolet Radiation Can Be\nExtremely \nDamaging\nThe term ultraviolet (UV) radiation refers to those wave-\nlengths of light that lie immediately below the blue end of the\nvisible spectrum. While the human eye cannot detect them,\nthey are strongly absorbed by organic compounds possessing\naromatic rings or multiple, conjugated double bonds. These\ninclude the nucleotide bases of DNA and RNA; the side chains\nof phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; polyunsaturated\nfatty acids; heme groups; and numerous cofactors and coen-\nzymes including flavins, cyanocobalamin, etc. Absorption of\nthis short wavelength, high-energy light can cause the rupture\nof covalent bonds in proteins, DNA, and RNA; the formation\nof thymine dimers in DNA ( Figure 57\u20134 ); cross-linking of pro-\nteins; and the generation of free radicals. While UV radiation\ndoes not penetrate beyond the first few layers of epidermal cells,\nthe high efficiency with which it is absorbed can lead to the rapid\naccumulation of damage by the skin. Because the nucleotide\nbases of DNA and RNA are particularly effective at absorbing\nUV radiation, it is highly mutagenic. Thus, prolonged expo-\nsure to intense sunlight can lead to the accumulation of mul-\ntiple DNA lesions that can overwhelm a cell\u2019s intrinsic repair\ncapacity, leading to the development of myelomas\u2014some of\nwhich aggressively proliferate if left untreated.\nProtein Glycation Often Leads to the\nForma\ntion of Damaging Cross-Links\nWhen amine groups in proteins and nucleotides are exposed\nto a r\neducing sugar such as glucose, they may form an adduct"

The initial step in this process\nis the formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde or\nketone group of the sugar and amine groups on proteins and\nother macromolecules. Over time, glycated proteins undergo\na series of rearrangements to form Amadori products, which\ncontain a conjugated carbon\u2013carbon double bond that can\nreact with the amino group on a neighboring macromolecule\n(Figure 57\u20135 ). The net result is the formation of a covalent\ncross-link between two proteins or other biologic macromol-\necules. These same macromolecules can, in turn, be glycated\nfurther, extending the network of cross-links to include other\nmacromolecules. These cross-linked aggregates are sometimes\ncalled advanced glycation end products orAGEs .\nThe physiologic impact of protein glycation can be espe-\ncially pronounced when long-lived proteins such as collagen\nor \u03b2-crystallins are affected. Their persistence enhances the\nopportunity for multiple glycation and subsequent cross-\nlinking events to occur. In blood vessels, the accumulation\nof cross-links in the collagen network of vascular endothelial\ncells can lead to the progressive loss of elasticity and thick-\nening of the basement membrane, both of which potentiate\nplaque formation. The end result is an increasing workload\nfor heart. In the eye, the accumulation of aggregated proteins\ncompromises the opacity of the lens, eventually manifesting\nitself as cataracts. Diabetics, whose ability to control blood\nglucose levels is impaired, are particularly susceptible to theformation of AGEs.

Oxidized glutathione, which consists of two tripep-\ntides linked by an S-S bond, is then enzymatically reduced to\nmaintain the pool of protectant (see Chapter 53).

Ascorbic acid and vitamin E also possess\nan\ntioxidant properties, which accounts for the popularity of\ndiets that emphasize foods or supplements rich in these com-\npounds to combat ROS and, hopefully, slow aging.\nThe Integrity of DNA Is Maintained by\nProofreading \n& Repair Mechanisms\nIn addition to the prophylactic measures mentioned earlier,\nliving \norganisms possess a limited capacity to replace or repair\ndamaged macromolecules. The largest suite of repair enzymes\nis the set devoted to maintaining the integrity of the nuclear\n(but not the mitochondrial) genome. This is to be expected\ngiven DNA \u2019s pivotal role in inheritance, its vulnerability to\nchemical assault and UV radiation, and the fact that\u2014by con-\ntrast to almost every other macromolecule\u2014each human cell\ncontains only one or two copies of each chromosome.\nMaintaining the integrity of the genome begins at replica-\ntion, where careful proofreading is performed to ensure that\nthe new genome formed during somatic cell division faith-\nfully replicates the template that directed its synthesis. The\nterm somatic refers to the differentiated cells that comprise the\nbody of an organism. In addition, most living organisms pos-\nsess an cadre of enzymes whose role is to inspect and correctaberrations that either escaped replicative proofreading or were\nsubsequently generated through the action of water (double-\nstrand breaks, depurination, and cytosine deamidation), UV\nradiation (thymine dimers and strand breaks), or exposure\nto chemical modifiers (adduct formation). This multilayered\nsystem is composed of mismatch repair enzymes, nucleotide\nexcision repair enzymes, and base excision repair enzymes as\nwell as the Ku system for repairing double-strand breaks in the\nphosphodiester backbone (see Chapter 35). As a last resort,\ncells harboring damaging mutations are subject to removal by\napoptosis.\nDespite the many precautions taken to identify and cor-\nrect errors, some mutations inevitably slip through. Indeed,\na low, but finite, frequency of mutation is necessary in order\nto generate the genetic variability that furthers evolution. The\nsomatic mutation theory of aging proposes that these muta-\ntions also serve as drivers of the aging process. Simply put, the\naccumulation of mutated somatic cells must inevitably lead to\ncompromised biologic function that manifests itself, at least in\npart, as the physical changes we associate with aging.\nSome Types of Protein Damage\nCan \nBe Repaired\nIn contrast to DNA, a cell\u2019s capacity to repair damage to other\nbio\nmolecules is relatively limited. For the most part, cells appear\nto rely on routine turnover, wherein the individual members of\nthe global population of a given biomolecule are degraded and\nreplaced by new synthesis on a continuing, or constitutive, basis\n(see Chapter 9) to remove damaged lipids, carbohydrates, and\nproteins. However, some proteins, particularly the fibrous pro-\nteins found in tendons, ligaments, bones, matrix, etc, undergo\nlittle, if any, turnover. These long-lived proteins tend to accu-\nmulate damage over the years, which contributes to the loss of\nelasticity in vascular tissues and joints, loss of lens opacity, etc.\nThe most prominent mechanisms for repairing damaged pro-\nteins target the oxidized side chain sulfur atoms of cysteine and\nmethionine, and the isoaspartyl groups formed when a peptide\nbond shifts from an \u03b1- to a side chain carboxyl group.\nThe side chain sulfhydryl group of cysteine frequently\nplays important catalytic, regulatory, redox, and structural\nroles (eg, cysteine disulfides, Fe-S centers) in proteins. How-\never, both the sulfhydryl group of cysteine and the sulfur\nether of methionine are extremely vulnerable to oxidation\n(see Figure 57\u20133C). Cysteine disulfides, cysteine sulfenic\nacids, and methionine sulfoxide can be reduced by disulfide\nreductases and methionine sulfoxide reductases, all of which\nuse NADPH as electron donor, or via direct reaction with\nreduced glutathione. Unfortunately, the reduction potentials\nof glutathione and NADPH are only sufficient to reduce the\nlowest oxidation states of these sulfur atoms: cysteine disulfides\nor sulfenic acids and methionine sulfoxide. Hence, cysteine\nsulfinic acid, cysteine sulfonic acid, and methionine sulfone\nare refractory to reduction by available biochemical means.\nAspartic acid possesses the precise geometry needed to\nbring its side chain carboxyl group into close proximity with"

Restoration of the normal\npeptide bond linkage is facilitated by the methylation of the\n\u03b1-carboxyl by isoaspartyl methyltransferase. Formation of the\nmethyl ester introduces a leaving group that potentiates\nthe reformation of the cyclic diamide, which can then reopen\nto form the normal peptide bond linkage (see Figure 57\u20136).\nAggregated Proteins Are Highly\nRefractory \nto Degradation or Repair\nModifications to a protein\u2019s composition or conformation\nthat cause it \nto adhere to other protein molecules can lead to\nthe formation of toxic aggregates, sometimes called amyloid .\nSuch aggregates are a hallmark of several neurodegenerative\ndiseases, including Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington disease,\nspinocerebellar ataxias, and the transmissible spongiform\nencephalopathies.

These caps also provide a source dispensable DNA to\naccommodate the wastage that occurs when linear chromo-\nsomes are replicated.\nThis wastage is a consequence of the fact that all DNA\npolymerases work unidirectionally, 3 \u2032to 5\u2032(see Chapter 35).\nWhen replicating linear double-stranded DNA via discon-\ntinuous 3 \u2032to 5\u2032synthesis, the 5 \u2032end of each new strand will\ngenerally commence roughly 100 bp short of the extreme 5 \u2032\nend of the template strand. Consequently, each time a dividing\ncell replicates its genome, its chromosomes become shorter\n(Figure 57\u20137 ). The telomeres provide an expendable source\nof DNA whose gradual loss is of little immediate conse-\nquence to the cell. However, once the supply of telomere DNA\nis exhausted, roughly 100 cell divisions for humans, mitosis\nceases, causing the somatic cell to enter a state of replicative\nsenescence . Hence, as our bodies age, they progressively lose\nthe capacity to replace lost or damaged cells.\nOrganisms are able to generate progeny that contain full-\nlength telomeres through the intervention of the enzyme\ntelomerase . Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is expressed\nin stem cells and most cancer cells, but not in somatic cells.\nUsing an RNA template, telomerase adds GT-rich hexanucleo-\ntide repeat sequences to the ends of linear DNA molecules that\nrestore their telomere caps to full length. In the laboratory, the\noperation of the proposed telomere clock has been demon-\nstrated using genetically engineered somatic cells that express\ntelomerase. As predicted by the telomere clock hypothesis, the\ncontinual restoration of their telomere caps enabled the genet-\nically engineered cells continued to divide in culture long after\nwild-type control cells entered replicative senescence.\nKenyon Used a Model Organism to\nDiscov\ner the First Aging Genes\nMany advances in biomedical science are the product of\nresearc\nh that uses a variety of so-called model organisms as"

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , has\nyielded a rich harvest of information concerning the genes that\nguide cellular differentiation and organ development. Baker\u2019s\nyeast and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis , have served\nas the workhorses for dissecting the signal transduction circuitry\nthat orchestrates the cell division cycle. A variety of cultured\nmammalian cell lines serve as surrogates for adipocytes, kidney\ncells, tumors, dendrites, etc. While at first glance it would appear\nthat many of these model systems share little in common with\nhumans, each possesses unique attributes that render them con-\nvenient vehicles for addressing particular problems or investigat-\ning specific cellular or molecular processes.Caenorhabditis elegans is a worm that has served as an\nimportant model for the study of developmental biology.\nCaenorhabditis elegans adults contain only 959 cells. Moreover,\nthis worm is transparent and grows rapidly, enabling the devel-\nopmental program that generates each cell in a mature adult to\nbe traced back to the fertilized egg. In the early 1990s, Cynthia\nKenyon and colleagues observed that worms carrying muta-\ntions in the gene encoding an insulin receptor-like molecule,\ndaf-2 , lived 70% longer than their wild-type counterparts.\nEqually important, the behavior of adult mutant worms\nresembled that of young wild-type C. elegans for much of\nthis period. This illustrates an important characteristic of a\nbona fide \u201caging gene. \u201d It must do more than simply prolong\nexistence. It must also delay some of the physiologic changes\nassociated with aging.\nInvestigation of further aging genes indicate they code for\neither one of a small set of transcription factors that include\nPHA-4 or DAF-16, which presumably control expression of\naging critical genes, or signaling proteins such as DAF-2 and\nmTOR that probably activate PHA-4, DAF-16, etc, in response\nto specific environmental signals. Much remains to be learned\nabout the extent to which aging is controlled by genetically\nprogrammed events, and how these genes and their products\ninteract with nutritional and other factors that influence vital-\nity and longevity.\nWHY WOULD EVOLUTION SELECT\nFOR \nLIMITED LIFESPANS?\nThe idea that animals would have evolved mechanisms\ndesigned \nspecifically to limit their lifespan would appear, at\nfirst glance, to be counterintuitive. If the driving force behind\nevolution is the selection for traits that enhance fitness and\nsurvival, should not this translate into an ever-increasing life\nexpectancy? However, while extending lifespan may represent\na desirable trait from the point of view of the individual, it\ndoes not necessarily follow that this applies to a population or\nspecies as a whole. A genetically programmed limit on lifespan\ncould benefit the group by eliminating the drain on available\nresources imposed by members no longer actively involved\nin the production, development, and training of offspring.\nIndeed, the current three-generation lifespan can be rational-\nized as providing time: (a) for newborns to develop into repro-\nductively active young adults, (b) for these young adults to\nproduce and nurture their offspring, and (c) for older adults\nto serve as a source of guidance and assistance to young adults\nfacing the challenges of childbirth and childrearing.\nSUMMARY\n\u25a0Aging and longevity are controlled via the complex interplay\nbetween rando\nm and deterministic factors that include genetic\nprogramming, environmental stresses, lifestyle, cellular\ncountdown clocks, and molecular repair processes.\n\u25a0Wear and tear theories hypothesize that the aging results from\nthe accum\nulation of biomolecular damage over time.REPLICATION\n+\nREPLICATION\n+\nREPLICATION\n+\nFIGURE 57\u20137 The telomeres at the ends of eukaryotic\nch\nromosomes progressively shorten with each cycle of replication.\nShown is a schematic diagram of the linear DNA of a eukaryotic\nchromosome (green) containing telomeres at each end (red). During\nthe first replication, new DNA strands are synthesized (green) using\nthe original chromosome as template. For simplicity, the next two\nreplication cycles (purple, yellow) show the fate of only the lower of\nthe two nucleotide products from the preceding replicative cycle.\nOpen arrowheads denote the site of incomplete strand synthesis.\nThe model assumes that the single strand overhangs at the ends of\neach chromosome are trimmed at the completion of each cycle of\ncell division. Note the progressive shortening of the telomere repeats."
