            "Text": "Preface\nLippincott\u00ae Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry is the long-standing book of international fame which is now being \nedited to suit the requirements of South Asia, particularly of India. The Medical Council of India (now National Medical Commission) has implemented Competency-Based Curriculum, which is  designed in such a manner that the primary \nhealthcare physician, while understanding the basic concepts of Biochemistry, is equally adept in applying this knowl-edge to patient care as he dons the very responsible role of a medical doctor. The learning shift is from rote learning to understanding to application and this is where Lippincott\n\u00ae Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry becomes valuable. The \nSouth Asian edition of Lippincott\u00ae Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry covers all the competencies in biochemistry for \nMBBS first phase and also the topics required for vertical and horizontal integration  with other subjects in all phases \nof MBBS. To cover all the competencies, three new units and fifteen new chapters have been added. These include \nchapters on cell membranes and subcellular components, regulation of blood pH and arterial blood gases, electrolyte imbalances, cancers, xenobiotics, oxidative stress, heme synthesis and catabolism, organ function tests, and vaccines. In the new unit on the complex topic of Immunology, we have tried to explain all basic concepts of immune system and immune cells, antigen and antibody, innate and adaptive immunity, cellular and humoral immunity in a clear and simple manner with explanatory diagrams.\nOne of the important changes in this edition is to make this book sufficient for students for exam purpose while making \nhim/her a good medical doctor. The 70 Clinical Cases  added at end of chapters are common cases which are asked \nin exams, at the level expected from first year students. All the knowledge, particularly the clinical cases, are in the MBBS must-know areas. The new  Medical Perspectives in each chapter also focuses on common diseases while \nmentioning the rare ones also. The Appendices at the end of each Unit  give summary of applicable knowledge, for \nexample, normal values in blood, common derangements in organ functions, recommended dietary allowances, diag-nostic criteria of various diseases like diabetes, healthy lipid levels, risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, diagnosis of common genetic mutations, etc., as pertinent to that unit and as relevant to medical practice. Therefore, this book is now an adequate and appropriate book for MBBS students.\nIn addition, there is a wide array of useful online resources\u201410 Clinical Cases, 200 Multiple-Choice Questions with \nanswers and detailed explanations, other than those present in the book, animations of 11 important topics such as DNA synthesis overview, electron transport chain, protein synthesis overview, and a chapter on Blood clotting.\nThe Editors are grateful to National Medical Commission who gave us permission to quote the CBME Curriculum \nCompetencies in this book.\nThe Editors would like to acknowledge the support and understanding of Dr. Binny Mathur who has been patiently \nguiding us on every step all the way, as also Gagandeep Kaur who was our first motivational contact from Wolters Kluwer. The Editorial team, Amit Rai and Dr. Richa Sharma are exceptional in their work; Amit has meticulously gone through the manuscript as well the proofs to ready the book in its present form. The typesetting unit at Design Modus has also done their work very proficiently. \nDr. Ritu Singh would like to acknowledge the blessings of her parents Dr. RV Singh and Mrs. Rama Singh, the encour-\nagement of her husband Dr. AV Sharma who has been a pillar of support throughout and daughter Dr. Ananya Sharma, son Mr. Akash Sharma, and daughter-in-law Mrs. Eepsa Malhotra. They have been strong, patient and understanding with my additional responsibility, even as we all did our duties with its associated daily risks during this Covid-19 pandemic.\nDr. Rajeev Goyal would like to acknowledge his mother late Smt. Saroj Goyal for her eternal blessings, father Sh. Suresh \nGoyal, and wife Dr. Monil Singhai for their constant encouragement and support and children Advit and Maanya. The children have been patient with an understanding beyond their years. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   5 24-10-2020   12:07:17"

            "Text": "Unit Overview\nHuman life is dependent on interactions of a wide diversity of biomolecules, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, \nnucleic acids, etc., which interact in a complex, regulated manner to carry out necessary functions of human body. Various chemical reactions are organized into metabolic pathways, most of the reactions catalyzed by enzymes. The amount of enzymes available and their activity level is tightly regulated, which in turn regulates the metabolic pathways. A disturbance in many of these interactions can produce a disease state.\n Cell, the smallest functional and structural unit of an organism, can be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells \nare composed of several membrane-enclosed organelles, each performing a unique function. Nucleus is the carrier of genetic information in the form of DNA and also coordinates activities of cell like growth, protein synthesis, metabolism and cell division. Mitochondria are the site of energy generation, while endoplasmic reticulum is involved in synthesis of proteins. Defect in the structure or functioning of these organelles leads to disease state (Chapter 2).\n Cell membrane is a lipid bilayer with integral and peripheral proteins. Cell membrane is selectively permeable, and \nthe transport across the membrane, which can be active or passive, is mediated by specialized transport proteins which are specialized for transport of specific molecules. These transport mechanisms are important for various cell functions such as maintenance of potential difference, intake of essential substances or secretion of products (Chapter 3).\n The pH of blood and body fluids is maintained in a narrow range, as it is important for activity of enzymes, \nion channels and transport proteins. Several mechanisms, including buffers, operate to maintain pH in the optimal range. Changes in pH, caused due to metabolic, respiratory or renal derangements, can produce acidosis or alkalosis. Whenever this change in pH occurs, other systems try to compensate and restore it to normal (Chapter 4).\n Water, which constitutes about 50%\u201360% of the body weight, is divided into intracellular and extracellular \ncompartments. These compartments vary in their electrolyte and protein content. A balance is maintained between water intake and excretion, which can be disturbed in physiological and pathological conditions. Water can move from one compartment to another, movement being determined by that compartment\u2019s osmolality. Sodium (along with its associated anions), urea and glucose are the major determinants of plasma osmolality. There are several mechanisms to maintain the water and electrolyte equilibrium, and disturbance in these, as seen in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), can lead to alterations in volume or osmolality (Chapter 5).\n For primary healthcare physician, it is important to understand the importance of organelles in different diseases. \nKnowledge of membrane transporters is essential for understanding the pathology of diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis) or for treatment modalities (e.g., oral rehydration solution). The pH of the body can be altered in many conditions. Difficulty in respiration, either due to nervous or pulmonary defects, can cause respiratory acidosis. Accumulation of metabolic acids, such as lactic acid or ketoacids, can cause metabolic acidosis. Several diseases and drugs can alter the water and electrolyte balance. Diuretics reduce the extracellular fluid volume by promoting renal excretion of Na\n+ \nand water. Loss of water and electrolytes due to vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration. Hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmias. Acidosis and alkalosis can cause electrolyte derangement by shifting them from one compartment to another. The knowledge of biochemical basis will be helpful in identifying the underlying cause of a disorder and its management.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   2 24-10-2020   12:07:18"

The knowledge of medical biochemistry is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of disease and planning its management. Almost all patients admitted to a hospital have biochemical tests done to aid in the diagnosis and treatment; patient management, hence, requires understanding of the basic metabolic processes, and patient management requires under-standing of the basic metabolic processes.\nThe subject of medical biochemistry involves studying biochemical \nprocesses in the human body, from clinical, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic perspectives. \nHuman body is composed of and dependent on a wide diversity of elements, \ncompounds and biomolecules. The discipline of medical biochem-istry involves the study of structure, properties and functions of biolog-ical molecules like nucleic acids, carbohydrates (Unit III), proteins (Unit II) and lipids (Unit IV) which influence health and disease. The ecosystem of life is orchestrated by complex metabolism regulated by various mecha-nisms such as enzyme activity, hormones and neurotransmitters, etc. In this, role of micro- and macronutrients, vitamins and minerals (Unit VII) also becomes significant because they facilitate optimal maintenance of   \ndifferent biochemical pathways. The compartmentalization of cells as part of various tissues as well as intracellular compartmentalization (Chapter 2) further adds to complexity as well as control of the metabolic processes. The body is essentially a \u201ccollection of chemicals\u201d and has processes to maintain, repair and grow itself. It also has processes to recognize its own cells (self-tolerance) as well as obstruct invasion from outside, e.g., in the form of bacteria and viruses (Unit IX: Immunology). The metabolic processes are further controlled by gene-environmental interactions as the environment (inside body or outside body) decides the activation or suppression of gene expression. At a metabolic level, this translates to production or suppression of production of certain enzymes and proteins (Unit VIII: Storage and Expression of Genetic Information). Any derange-ment in the delicate balance of the myriad biochemical reactions in the body may pose a threat to health and begin the march of disease. \nThousands of chemical reactions that take place within the cells in our \nbody maintaining a homeostatic state are collectively known as metabo-lism. These chemical reactions are organized into metabolic pathways, each step being catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Some reactions may even be non-enzymatic.

Biochemical Basis of Medicine\ninclude carbohydrate and energy metabolisms, lipid and lipoprotein metab-\nolisms, amino acid and protein metabolisms, and nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis. These processes are controlled by many factors including energy demand of cell (e.g., exercise, starvation and diabetic states), influ-ence of hormones (e.g., insulin and glucagon), mental states (e.g., release of adrenaline and cortisol), diurnal rhythms (melatonin), food intake (e.g., obesity), genetics (e.g., thalassemias) and many more.\nFor meaningful interpretation of the results obtained from the advances in \ntechnology, the basic understanding of biochemical processes is important. Screening tests can be useful in early detection of disease in susceptible persons, but the physician must be able to evaluate occasional screening test abnormalities in a healthy person. This may be due to individual varia-tions and do not necessarily signify underlying pathology. \nSome cells and organs are specifically involved in metabolism of certain \nmolecules; the metabolism of such molecules are impaired when func-tioning of these organs are affected (e.g., high ammonia levels may indi-cate problem in urea formation in liver). Therefore, careful analysis of a patient\u2019s presentation, considered along with patient\u2019s ethnicity and age group, prevalent conditions in that geographical area and family history, can help in pinpointing the disease and preparing a differential diagnosis, which can then be confirmed by relevant investigations.\nMeasurement of number of specific markers gives useful information in \nthe diagnosis and management of disease. Enzymes, such as those of the coagulation cascade, have a defined function in blood and their levels can be altered in disease. Other enzymes, such as creatine kinase appear in the \nblood incidentally and reflect tissue injury. Further, analysis of isoenzymes can indicate the source tissue (e.g., CK-MB indicates myocardial tissue injury, whereas CK-MM indicates skeletal muscle derangements). Enzymes are also the preferred markers in numerous pathological conditions such as hepatitis ( alanine transaminase , aspartate transaminase , alkaline phos-\nphatase ), pancreatitis and many cancers. They provide vital insights into \nthe disease process by way of diagnosis, progress and assessment of response to therapy. Instead of focusing on rare disorders, the more common diseases should be considered first. Generally, the investigations are ordered as a group, and their patterns of derangement are valuable in confirming the diagnosis. It is also important to understand that the biolog-ical processes do not occur in isolation and perturbations in one process can have disturbing effects on many other processes. \nTo further orient the medical students to the vast and complicated world of \nbiochemistry, and the application of which is the basis of medicine, a few examples are given below. \nI. EDEMA\nIn a patient with swelling of the body due to accumulation of fluid, known as edema, several pathways could have been disturbed. Only if a physi-cian knows about the affected pathways, he/she can work out the diag-nosis. If edema is generalized, it can be due to hypoalbuminemia. In such a case, various factors affecting serum albumin concentration must be assessed, such as nutritional deficiency (Chapter 31) and hepatic disease (see Chapter 48). History, physical examination, urinalysis, and other inves-tigations will help in identifying the probable cause (see Appendix Unit II, Table 1).

If there is a history \nof chronic alcoholism, cirrhosis of liver causing decreased synthesis of albumin is the most probable cause.\nII. ANEMIA\nA patient may present with generalized weakness, loss of appetite and irri-tability. This is a general, nonspecific presentation. But as focused history is elicited and specific signs looked for, probable diagnosis comes up. If the patient has pallor, anemia is a probability, especially in children and women of poor socioeconomic status, due to iron deficiency or hookworm infes-tations. Diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia can be confirmed by hemo-gram and peripheral smear (see Fig. 33.9, p. 558). Presence of pigmented and scaling rash will indicate niacin deficiency, secondary to isoniazid use, a commonly used antitubercular drug which is a structural analog of niacin (see Chapter 32, p. 531). In case of megaloblastic anemia, it is important to understand that folic acid supplementation can partially reverse the hema-tologic abnormalities of vitamin B\n12 deficiency and, therefore, can mask a \nvitamin B 12 deficiency, which can later result in CNS defects.\nIII. JAUNDICE\nAn increase in bilirubin, known as jaundice, may be a sign of problem with one or many of the processes involved in survival of red blood cells or functioning of liver and bile ducts. Jaundice may be physiological or path-ological. It may further be prehepatic, hepatic or posthepatic. Blood tests for liver function give indication of the cause. Conjugated bilirubin, being polar and water soluble is excreted in urine. If urine bilirubin is present, it shows that the cause is hepatic or obstructive. The brown color of stool is due to stercobilin, which is produced by action of intestinal bacteria on bilirubin, therefore, light colored stool indicates obstruction to excretion of bile pigments.\nIV. OBESITY\nFat cells in the adipose tissue store excess energy as triglyceride, to be released as free fatty acids for use at other sites, when required. This system allows survival during food deficit periods. However, with sedentary lifestyle and nutritional abundance, excessive fat stores produce obesity, which is linked to a large number of adverse health consequences, such as cardio-vascular diseases, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis and increased risk of several types of cancer. For management of obesity, the knowledge of composition and energy content of common diets is required for diet therapy.\nV. DIABETES MELLITUS\nDiabetes mellitus which, biochemically, is just a persistent increase in blood glucose, has a significant economic cost, both due to treatment-related expenses and loss of productivity.

Further, the physician must do the tests like glycated hemoglobin to monitor the disease, regulate blood glucose levels by therapy and watch for long-term complications like nephropathy (test for albumin excretion rate), cataract, hyperlipidemias and neuropathy. Besides drug therapy, medical nutrition therapy, which includes optimal coordination of caloric intake, along with other aspects of diabetes therapy (insulin, exercise, weight loss) has signif-icant role in preventing or delaying the onset and complications of type 2 DM in high-risk individuals. It is again based on basic knowledge of food components, their carbohydrate content and glycemic index. Regular moni-toring of glucose and lipids and screening for complications are required in diabetic patients. The type of sample and timing of collection can affect the results and need to be taken care of.\nVI. ELECTROLYTE BALANCE AND pH\nMany conditions can affect the pH of blood. Though there are several mechanisms to ensure that blood pH is maintained in a narrow range, several disorders can overwhelm these mechanisms, producing acidosis or alkalosis. The differences in intra- and extracellular pH and composi-tion of electrolytes can be disturbed in a wide variety of conditions and can have profound effects on critical body functions. Strenuous exer-cise can produce acidosis due to accumulation of lactic acid, produced during anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscles. Acidosis can cause hyper-kalemia, which in turn, can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. A patient of apparently common gastroenteritis, having severe vomiting may land in life-threatening alkalosis, due to loss of gastric HCl. Severe dehydra-tion and fluid loss are major causes of diarrheal deaths, and knowledge of biochemistry of sodium and glucose absorption from intestine helps in preventing dehydration by using simple foods available at home. Further, IV fluids given in hospitals require an essential knowledge of electrolyte balance of body and normal sodium, potassium, and chloride levels which have to be maintained.\nVII. DRUG INTERACTIONS\nThe biochemical properties of drugs can affect their absorption and action of drugs. Acidic drugs are absorbed from stomach, while basic drugs are absorbed from intestine. Acidification of urine promotes the excretion of basic drugs. Most of the drugs bind reversibly to plasma proteins, such as albumin. The bound drug remains restricted to vascular compartment, as protein-bound drugs do not cross membranes and also remain for longer time in the body as their metabolism and excretion are also delayed. More than one drug can bind to the same site within the protein, and a drug can displace another drug, changing its duration or intensity of action.\nVIII. AGING\nAging is another condition which has multidimensional effects on normal metabolism, disease susceptibility, disease manifestations, response to treatment, and disease outcomes. In older individuals, normal homeostatic mechanisms also have reduced capabilities and can be overwhelmed by \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   6 24-10-2020   12:07:18"

Aging is also thought to be associated with increased oxidative stress damage. The primary healthcare physician while prescribing the type and dosage of medicines should take into account the reduced drug metabolizing and excretion capacities of the elderly. The values of several lab parameters also change with age and this should be considered when evaluating the lab results of aged patients. Both the energy require-ment and availability also change with aging. \nIX. PREANALYTICAL VARIATIONS IN SAMPLES \nThe primary healthcare physician must be very careful to do appropriate sampling such that preanalytical errors (i.e., errors that occur during a labo-ratory test, before the sample is measured by the analyzer) do not inter-fere with report authenticity. The type of sample, such as whole blood (venous, arterial or capillary), serum, plasma, urine or other body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, etc.) to be tested also needs to be decided as per suspected disease. Timing of sample collec-tion (random or early morning, spot urine or 24-hour collection, a partic-ular day of menstrual cycle for fertility-related hormones, etc.) and patient preparation, all affect the test results and have to be considered. Wrong sample collection techniques, inappropriate additives or preservatives and inappropriate sampling site can give erroneous results. Sample for blood glucose must be collected in a tube having sodium fluoride as it will inhibit in vitro further glycolysis in sample. For analysis of serum, a plain evacu-ated tube is required which will allow the sample to clot. If blood is required as for glycated hemoglobin, the sample collection tube must have ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) to prevent blood from clotting. If there is hemolysis during sample collection, red cell contents such as potassium are released, and their levels will be falsely elevated. If tourniquet is applied for prolonged time, water diffuses into the interstitial space and the serum or plasma sample will be concentrated and show falsely elevated levels of proteins and protein-bound components of plasma, such as calcium or thyroxine. Samples collected from a site of ongoing intravenous fluid infusion will give wrong results, as the fluid will either dilute the spec-imen, reducing the measured amount or give falsely elevated results, (e.g., increased plasma glucose levels in a sample that was collected from a vein where dextrose intravenous drip was being administered).\nX. GENETICS\nThe primary healthcare physician must be well aware of the genetic influences in disease (see Unit VIII: Storage and Expression of Genetic Information). This becomes very important in some areas like prenatal diag-nosis of disease. Chorionic villi sampling and sampling by amniocentesis are used to diagnose diseases such as thalassemias, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia in unborn child. This is followed by genetic counseling of the antenatal mother so that she can make informed deci-sions. A positive quadruple screening test of maternal serum for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is further confirmed by karyotyping using an amniocen-tesis sample. Recombinant DNA technology is another area of biochemistry where the advances have led to quantum leaps in patient care. The produc-tion of human insulin, blood clotting factors VIII and IX, growth hormone, albumin, and thrombolytic agents are achievements of genetic engineering \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   7 24-10-2020   12:07:18"

Infectious diseases like human immunodefi-\nciency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis can be diagnosed by poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) and specific probes, even in the window period. In the year 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and the diagnosis can be made by real-time PCR by detection of specific genes of the SARS-CoV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2). A doctor must be aware of the genetic diagnosis available and keep himself/herself updated on gene augmentation and therapy as it is being devel-oped for patient care.\nMolecular medicine has also altered the way diseases are classified. In \ncancers, the classification systems, which were earlier based on the extent of spread and histopathological features, are now expanding to include molecular features. The field is progressing from diagnosis of disease to prediction of occurrence of disease, and now to the choice of treatment based on individual genetic composition, the era of personalized medicine based on genetic analysis.\nXI. Chapter Summary\nMuch like the medical science itself, biochemistry is a vast area of research that yields profound discoveries each year. \nWithout the ongoing flurry of scientific breakthroughs made by biochemists, we would not have had the precise chemical and molecular knowledge to create the vital drugs, therapies and diagnostic tools that are used every day. Biochemical techniques advance our understanding of the chemical structures and processes that underpin human health and disease, revealing the underlying transformations between these physiological and pathological states. Biochemistry and medicine enjoy a mutually stimulating relationship. Biochemistry has been offering insights and solutions to questions posed by physicians. It has been at the service of patients contributing to better understanding of the basis of disease at molecular level, offering appropriate tests for diagnosis of disease and explaining the impact particular drugs will have on molec-ular processes (including adverse effects). For physicians, a detailed knowledge of biochemistry is an essential prerequi-site in implementing evidence-based medicine and improving patient outcomes.\nFor all the superspecialized fields of medicine like diabetology, endocrinology, cardiology, gastroenterology, nephrology, \nneurology, oncology, etc., biochemistry is continuously fostering better disease understanding, and diagnostic and prog-nostic testing in interest of patient care. Notable contributions in the field of patient care include diagnosis and monitoring  \nof diabetes with the discovery of glycated hemoglobin, understanding water, electrolyte and hydrogen ion homeostasis, contribution towards development and monitoring of intravenous nutrition, and in-depth understanding of role of lipids and lipoprotein transport mechanisms for management of cardiovascular diseases. A pathbreaking contribution was the development of point-of-care testing which provided an easy platform for bedside emergency testing (e.g., troponin in myocardial infarction) and self-testing by patients (e.g., blood glucose levels by glucometer).\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in laboratory automation and workflow management. Evidence-based \nclinical biochemistry is coming up in a big way in line with evidence-based medicine wherein clinical biochemists critically evaluate the existing evidence towards diagnostic tests. In recent years, substantial growth has been achieved in molec-ular diagnostics, genetic screening (prenatal and neonatal), screening for inborn errors of metabolism, immunochemistry, hormone analysis, mass spectrometric analysis, next-generation sequencing, PCR for infectious diseases, neurochem-istry, and many more.\nTo conclude, the spectrum of biochemistry in medicine ranges from a simple observation that lemon juice, rich in vitamin C, \ncan prevent life-threatening scurvy in sailors to the exciting possibility of gene therapy for treatment of genetic disorders such as thalassemias, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and sickle cell disease.\nWe must utilize the full scope of Biochemistry and its vast knowledge to practice medicine effectively.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   8 24-10-2020   12:07:18"

As \nan independent unit, a cell can metabolize its own nutrients, provide for its own energy and replicate itself to produce succeeding generations of cells. It can be viewed as an enclosed compartment in which innumer-able chemical reactions take place simultaneously, contributing to life and procreation of the cell. Collection of similar cells form tissues, and collec-tion of tissues form organs, which carry out the functions necessary to sustain the life of an organism (\nFig. 2.1 ). An organelle or the subcellular \ncomponents are different types of membrane-enclosed bodies in the cell, each performing a unique function. Metabolism comprising of both, anab-olism and catabolism, takes place in the cell\u2014most of the body functions ultimately happens at the cellular level.

It is the carrier of genetic information in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The thread-like DNA is tightly packed with nuclear proteins (histones) to form chromatin. Somatic cells in humans have 46 chromosomes compactly packed in the nucleus. The nucleus coordinates various activities of cell like growth, protein synthesis, metabolism and cell division. It is sepa-rated from rest of the cell by double-layered nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane is continuous with endoplasmic reticulum and has pores which allow the movements of RNA, hormones and regulatory proteins to and fro from cytosol. Some hormones interact at specific sites on the DNA to regulate transcription. Some cells like the human red blood cell (RBC) lose their nuclei on maturation.

The apparatus has three primary compartments, known as \u201ccis\u201d (cisternae nearest to the ER), \u201cmedial\u201d (central layers of cisternae), and \u201ctrans\u201d (cisternae farthest from ER).\nProximal or cis region receives the freshly synthesized proteins from \nER. The proteins must have the \u201csignal peptide\u201d to be accepted by Golgi apparatus for transport.\nAt medial part, certain posttranslational modifications of proteins occur. \nThese modifications involve addition of fatty acids to form lipidated proteins, or phosphate groups (phosphorylation) to form phosphopro-teins, or oligosaccharides to the side chain to form glycoproteins.\nIn the final stage, modified proteins and lipids are sorted in trans Golgi \nnetwork and are packaged into vesicles at the trans face. These vesicles then deliver the molecules to their target destination such as lysosomes or the cell membrane or for secretion outside the cells.\nE. Lysosomes\nThey are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes (approx-imately 60 in number) that are involved in breakdown of biomole-cules\u2014carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. The enzymes of lysosomes are synthesized in RER where they receive an N-linked oligosaccharide. From there, they are transported to Golgi apparatus, where mannose residues of the oligosaccharide get phosphorylated; this helps in binding of these proteins to mannose-6-phosphate recep-tors present in the trans-Golgi; finally, they are directed towards lyso-somes. The lysosomal enzymes responsible for hydrolysis require an acidic environment for optimal activity (pH  \u223c 5.0). Lysosomes are \ncapable of fusing with other organelles and digesting cellular debris, in a process known as autophagy. Lysosomes are abundantly present in macrophages. They can break down bacteria and other microorgan-isms following the phagocytosis of these particles by macrophages. So, they are aptly called as the \u201cwaste disposal system\u201d of the cell. Lysosomes contain enzymes like phosphatases, nucleases , polysac-\ncharide hydrolyzing enzymes, proteases  and lipid-degrading enzymes.\nF. Peroxisomes\nThese are membrane-bound organelles found in the cytoplasm. They \nare involved in oxidative reactions and contain enzymes that transfer hydrogen atoms from organic substrates to molecular oxygen, which, as and in course generates hydrogen peroxide\u2014the latter is neutralized by the enzyme catalase to water and oxygen. This reaction is impor-tant in liver cells to detoxify various toxic substances. They perform key role in lipid metabolism, as they are involved in the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids to medium-chain fatty acids which are subsequently shuttled to mitochondria for \u03b2-oxidation. They are also involved in the \nmetabolism of branched chain fatty acids.\nG. Cell membranes\nCell membrane is a biological membrane that separates interior of all cells from the outside environment (the extracellular space). Some of the functions of the cell membrane are selective transport of ions and organic molecules, cell adhesion, ion conductivity, and cell signaling.I-cell disease\nInclusion cell disease is a rare \ninherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormal-ities and mental retardation. It results when newly synthe-sized lysosomal enzymes fail to reach the proper intra-cellular locations, and are instead secreted outside the cell. Thus, the intracellular levels of these enzymes are reduced/absent, while the plasma levels are elevated. Mannose 6-phosphate is the marker to target the nascent enzymes to the lysosomes. In patients with I-cell disease, absence of a certain enzyme involved in the generation of mannose-6-phosphate resi-dues prevents the proper targeting of the lysosomal hydrolases  to the lysosomes. \nSince many macromolecules are degraded by these hydro-\nlases , I-cell disease leads to \naccumulation of molecules like mucolipids and muco-polysaccharides within the cells of many tissues of the body, leading to the clinical manifestations.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   12 24-10-2020   12:07:19"

The lipids are in the form of phospholipids and cholesterol; the latter assists in the maintenance of the fluidity of the membrane. Peripheral proteins are present on the surface of lipid bilayer, usually attached non-cova-lently with membrane lipids. The protein spectrin, present in the RBC membrane, is an example of one such protein.\nIntegral membrane proteins are deeply embedded in lipid bilayer and \nare attached to the membrane by hydrophobic interactions. Some span the entire bilayer and are called transmembrane proteins. They serve as receptors (for hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.), tissue-specific anti-gens, ion channels, and membrane enzymes (Chapter 3).\nH. Cytoskeleton\nIt is a network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells. The cytoskeleton gives specific shape to the cells and is responsible for locomotion of cell itself as well as the movement of various organelles within it. It also facilitates the movement of chromo-somes during cell division. The major type of filaments in cytoskeleton include microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules.\nMicrofilaments are predominantly composed of actin\u2014they help in \nmuscle contraction, cell movement, maintenance of cell shape.\nIntermediate filaments impart mechanical support to the cells. It is \nformed by different proteins in different tissues, but one of the most common proteins that comprise intermediate filaments is keratin.\nMicrotubules are hollow cylinders and are formed by polymerization \nof the protein, tubulin. The cilia and flagella are structural compo-nents of cell and they are maintained by microtubules which give them strength and movement. They also play a role in intracellular transport and in the formation of mitotic spindles during mitosis and meiosis. \nI. Cytoplasm\nCytoplasm is a highly viscous solution with suspended particles and cell organelles that fills each cell and is enclosed by cell membrane. It makes up about 70% of the cell volume. It is site for various metabolic pathway (e.g., glycolysis, glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, hexose monophosphate [HMP] shunt, fatty acid synthesis, etc.). The term cytosol is used to denote that portion of the cytoplasm from which the organelles are excluded.\nJ. Ribosomes\nThey are nucleoprotein (RNA and proteins) assemblies which bind messenger RNA and transfer RNA, to synthesize polypeptides and proteins. Ribosomes, being entirely particulate, do not have a cell membrane and are often called \u201cnon-membranous organelles.\u201d They have two subunits, the small subunits read the mRNA, and the large subunits catalyze the formation of  polypeptide chains from amino acids. Ribosomes can be free or membrane bound depending on their spatial distribution in the cell. They are membrane bound when attached to ER.\nA brief description of different cell organelles, and their marker enzymes \nis given in \nFigure 2.4 .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   13 24-10-2020   12:07:19"

This holds true especially for identification and purification of proteins that are present in an organelle, and also while studying the effects that a drug or a disease exert on an organ-elle. The separation of organelles is most commonly achieved by a process known as \"differential centrifuga-tion.\" The cells that are being studied are lysed by disrupting the cell membrane with the help of detergents and/or hypotonic solutions. The resulting \"lysate\" is subjected to centrifugation, initially at lower speeds and durations to facilitate the sedimentation of denser organelles. The supernatant is then further subjected to centrifugations at higher speeds and prolonged durations, so that relatively less dense organelles can be separated. Centrifugation of the cell lysate at 500 g for 10 minutes leads to pelleting of the nuclear fraction; 10,000 g for 20 minutes results in sedimentation of mitochondria. Centrifugations at speeds of 100,000 g or more is termed as ultracentrifugation. Ultracentrifugation for 100,000 g and a duration of 1 hour leads to pelleting of fragments of endoplasmic reticulum (these are referred to as microsomes); the supernatant at this stage will contain soluble proteins of the cytoplasm. The purity of a fraction separated using differen-tial centrifugation can be assessed by estimating the level or activity of certain molecules (usually enzymes) that are present exclusively in that organelle/cell fraction.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   14 24-10-2020   12:07:19"

Medical Perspectives \n\u2022 Protein synthesis occurs in ribosomes that are present free in the cytoplasm, or that are attached to the endoplasmic \nreticulum. From the site of their synthesis, the proteins are targeted to their destined organelles usually with the help of certain specific amino acid sequences known as \"signal sequences.\" As already mentioned, lysosomal proteins are targeted with the help of a mannose-6-phosphate residue, rather than an amino acid sequence. Defects in the targeting of proteins to their respective intracellular sites can result in diseases. As an example, in the human body glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine by the peroxisomal enzyme, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase . A targeting defect \nof this enzyme resulting in its localization to mitochondria, rather than peroxisomes, leads to accumulation of glyox-ylate; the latter is then converted to oxalate, which combines with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate, resulting in formation of renal stones\u2014the condition is termed as type I hyperoxaluria ( hyper  \u2013 increased, oxal \u2013 oxalate, uria \u2013 \npresence in urine).\n\u2022 Mitochondrial defects are caused by a mutation in mitochondrial genome and they are maternally inherited\u2014some \nof the examples include Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, to name a few. Maternal inheritance occurs because the zygote derives its mitochondria from the ovum at the time of fertil-ization, rather than from the sperm. Incidence is 1 in 5,000 individuals. Since the primary function of mitochondria is energy production in the form of ATP , those tissues that have huge energy requirements (like neurons and muscles) are primarily affected in mitochondrial disorders.\n\u2022 Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of genetically inherited diseases characterized by accumulation of \nundigested macromolecules inside the lysosomes, due to defects in various hydrolytic enzymes. The most common LSD is Gaucher\u2019s disease. Others include Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Hunter syndrome. \n The accumulated macromolecules as such can cause cellular dysfunction. Further, the accumulated macromolecules \nwithin the lysosomes compromise other lysosomal functions like autophagy of old and worn-out organelles. Abnormal metabolites generated by these defective organelles also propagate the cellular dysfunction in lysosomal storage diseases.\n\u2022 Acid phosphatases are marker enzymes for lysosomes. They are produced in many tissues/cells like osteoclasts, plate-\nlets, spleen, erythrocytes and prostate gland. Elevated levels of acid phosphatase in plasma results from release of the \nenzyme from these tissues in various pathologies affecting these tissues/cells.\n\u2022 Zellweger syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by complete absence of peroxisomes in the cells, due to \ndefects in proteins required for the biogenesis of peroxisomes. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Since peroxi-somes are involved in the oxidation of long chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids, they accumulate in cells and tissues. Patients do not survive beyond 1 year.\n\u2022 Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited disorder in which there is defect of spectrin, a component of RBC cytoskel-\neton. The resulting alteration in the shape of RBCs leads to a loss of erythrocyte surface area. These cells are rapidly removed from the circulation by spleen resulting in anemia.\n\u2022 Signaling through insulin receptor begins with binding of the insulin. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, there is insulin \ndeficiency. Diabetes mellitus type II, on the other hand, is characterized by insulin receptor resistance. \n\u2022 Anticancer drugs like vinblastine and vincristine inhibit the formation of mitotic spindle. Since this is essential for the \nproceeding of cell cycle, these drugs inhibit the cell division, thus abrogating cell proliferation in malignancies.\nIV. Chapter Summary\nA eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles that \nallow compartmentalization of various biochemical functions. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within the nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached to ER. They perform protein synthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration and produce ATP . Peroxisomes break down fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles are storage and transport compartments. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of cells. The endomembrane system includes nuclear envelope, the ER, Golgi apparatus, lyso-somes, and vesicles. These work together to modify, package, tag, and transport membrane lipids and proteins. The cyto-skeleton provides rigidity and shape to cells. Microtubules pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell and are structural elements of cilia and flagella. The human body is complex and has levels of organization that build on each other. Cells make up tissues, tissues make up organs, and organs make up organ systems.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   15 24-10-2020   12:07:19"

Explain in detail how compartmentalization at the cellular level is important for carrying out various biochemical \nfunctions of the cell. \nClinical Case Questions\nAnswer\u2014A:  Peroxisomes. The condition described is \nassociated with elevated levels of a branched chain fatty acid known as phytanic acid in circulation. Normally, branched chain fatty acids are catabolized by enzymes located in peroxisomes. Defect in these enzymes or in the formation of peroxisome as such, results in accumula-tion of branched chain fatty acids in the cells and in circu-lation. The case given here is that of Refsum disease, which occurs most commonly due to mutations in the peroxisomal enzyme, phytanyl CoA hydroxylase. Refsum disease can also occur due to defective targeting of this enzyme to the peroxisomes.  2.1. A 12-year-old child with progressive hearing \nloss, visual disturbances, and abnormal gait was brought for consultation. History revealed that the child was normal at birth, but gradually developed loss of hearing and loss of smell.

Which cell organelle could have been affected \nin this disease? Justify the answer.\nAnswer\u2014C:  In I-cell disease, lysosomal hydrolases \nare secreted outside the cell, instead of these enzymes being targeted to lysosomes. This results in accumula-tion of various macromolecules in the lysosomes, leading to cellular dysfunctions\u2014causing coarse facial features, neurological abnormalities, etc.\n In primary hyperoxaluria, the enzyme involved in \nconversion of glyoxylate to glycine is targeted to mito-chondria instead of peroxisomes. Glyoxylate that accumu-lates is converted to oxalic acid\u2014forming calcium oxalate renal stones.C. Give examples of diseases due to defective \nprotein targeting to organelles.Answer\u2014B:  The maintenance of normal cell membrane \nstructure is very crucial in tissues like nervous tissue, where localized modifications of the cell membrane is involved in the formation of vesicles for release of neurotransmitters.

Intracellularly, membranes also make different subcellular compartments which perform various functions. Cell membrane and organelle membranes consist of a lipid bilayer in combination with membrane proteins. The membrane proteins and lipids carry out different functions\u2014transport of materials into and out of the cell, cell sensing and signal transduction, cellular recognition of antigens, cell-cell communica-tion via hormones and neurotransmitters, and communication between cellular compartments. Membrane functions are therefore vital to health\u2014specific defects in membrane proteins, and various toxins that act on the membrane, are associated with numerous known disease states. \nII. BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF MEMBRANES \nCell membrane is composed of lipid bilayer with embedded (or integral) proteins and peripheral proteins. Carbohydrates are also present in the membranes as a part of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The proportions of lipids and proteins present in the cell membrane vary in different cells of the body; for example, nerve cell membrane is rich in lipids, whereas hepato-cyte cell membrane is rich in proteins.\nAmong the intracellular organelles, the inner membrane of mitochondria, \nwhich is the location of a large number of enzymes involved in metabo-lism, is highly rich in proteins, compared to lipids. Further, the individual constituents of the membrane lipids and proteins greatly vary with different cells and different organelles. For instance, the phospholipid cardiolipin is present abundantly in the inner mitochondrial membrane, compared to other organelle membranes\u2014it is required for the optimal functioning of various complexes of the electron transport system.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Describe the fluid mosaic model and the structure of membrane bilayer\n\u2022 Discuss the different functions of various proteins in the cell membrane\u2022 Explain the different types of membrane transport\u2014passive and active \ntransport, and endocytosis and exocytosis\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   19 24-10-2020   12:07:19"

            "Text": "20 3. Cell Membranes\nA. Lipid constituents \nThe major lipids present in the membranes are phospholipids, glyco-\nsphingolipids and cholesterol. The proportion of these lipids varies with the cells and the organelles. The distribution of the lipids is also asym-metric between the two leaflets of lipid bilayer. For example, phospha-tidylserine is a glycerol containing phospholipid (glycerophospholipid) present in the inner lipid leaflet of the membrane bilayer. When a cell undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death), phosphatidylserine is flipped to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane\u2014there, it acts as a signal for macrophages to engulf and clear the dying cell.\n 1. Phospholipids:  Glycerophospholipids are the most common \namongst the two major phospholipids of the cell membrane (\nFig. 3.1 ). The fatty acids of the glycerophospholipids usually have \neven numbered carbon atoms. They may be saturated or unsat-urated (i.e., they contain one or more double bonds). The pres-ence of double bonds produces a \u201ckink\u201d in the structure of the fatty acid which leads to an increase in the membrane fluidity (\nFig. 3.1 ). \nThe most abundant saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the membranes are palmitic acid and oleic acid, respectively. The second major type of phospholipid in the membrane is sphingo-myelin. It is an example of a sphingophospholipid. Here, fatty acids and phosphate are attached to sphingosine, a long chain amino alcohol, rather than to glycerol. Fatty acid is attached by an amide linkage to the amino group of sphingosine. It also contains choline, or trimethyl ethanolamine. As the name suggests, sphingomyelin is a prominent component of myelin sheaths.\n Phospholipids contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions \nand therefore termed amphipathic. They contain one polar head and two nonpolar hydrophobic tails. The polar heads are formed by the phosphate group (and many a times the alcohol attached to it), whereas the hydrophobic tails are formed by the two fatty acids esterified to glycerol. The amphipathic nature of phospho-lipids helps them to spontaneously arrange in such a way that the hydrophobic tails interact with each other, remaining away from the surrounding water molecules. The polar heads come in direct contact with the intra- and extracellular aqueous environment. This whole arrangement allows the formation of various lipid enclosed structures in vivo and in vitro (\nFig. 3.2 ).\nVesicles are formed by the shedding from the membranes; like \nthe membranes from which they are derived, they also have a lipid bilayer. Vesicles are involved in transport of certain molecules between different organelles of the cell, and also in endocytosis and exocytosis of molecules, into and outside the cell, respectively.\nLiposomes are prepared artificially by subjecting a solution of phos-\npholipids to sound waves (sonication). They possess a lipid bilayer and an internal aqueous environment which can be loaded with a cargo, for example, a drug, while these particles are synthesized. Liposomal preparations are currently in use for targeted delivery of drugs, so as to reduce their unwanted effects in non-target tissues. Additionally, it is also used for the delivery of nucleic acids in gene therapy trials. The specificity of liposomes is enhanced by incorpo-rating components like antibodies in the liposomal membrane so that they are targeted to specific tissues or tumors.

Biochemical Composition of Membranes  21\nMicelles are composed of a single layer of lipids with the hydro-\nphobic tails enclosed within\u2014in the intestines, lipids are absorbed in the form of micelles.\n 2. Cholesterol:  It is the major sterol present in the membranes. \nThe steroid ring of cholesterol is embedded between the hydro-phobic tails of phospholipids and therefore provides rigidity to the membrane. Only its hydrophilic hydroxyl group is at the aqueous interface. Cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer of the membranes\u2014when the membrane fluidity increases, the rigid structure of choles-terol tends to restore it to a lower level. On the other hand, cholesterol also prevents the reduction of membrane fluidity by preventing the fully compact arrangement of the hydrophobic fatty acid chains. \n 3. Lipid rafts, caveolae and tight junctions:  These are specialized \nstructures in the cell membrane. \n Lipid rafts are dynamic areas on the outer leaflet of lipid bilayer \nand are enriched with cholesterol, sphingolipids and signaling proteins. They are involved in signal transduction and in response to external stimuli.\n   Caveolae are small invaginations of the cell membrane into the cyto-\nplasm; they are derived from the lipid rafts. They are flask-shaped structures containing the protein caveolin-1. Proteins of caveolae are components of signal transduction systems (e.g., insulin and some G proteins). They also mediate the transport of fatty acids and other molecules across the cell membrane. \nB. Protein constituents\nProteins are the major functional molecules of membranes. They act as enzymes, pumps and transporters, channels, structural components, antigens and receptors for various molecules. There are two catego-ries of membrane proteins\u2014integral proteins and peripheral proteins. \n 1. Integral or intrinsic proteins  span the lipid bilayer usually as a \nbundle of \u03b1-helical transmembrane segment. Some proteins like \ntransporters, ion channels, various receptors and G proteins span the bilayer multiple times, while some proteins like glycophorin A in the RBCs span the membrane only once. Integral proteins can be separated from the membrane only with the help of membrane disruption using strong detergents.\n 2. Peripheral proteins  are bound to hydrophilic regions of intrinsic \nproteins and/or polar head of phospholipids through electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Unlike integral proteins, they can be easily removed from the membrane by treatment with ionic solu-tions. One such peripheral protein of the RBC membrane, ankyrin binds to a cytoskeletal protein, spectrin, and this interaction plays an important role in maintaining biconcave shape of the erythrocyte. \nC. Carbohydrate constituents\nCarbohydrates are located on the external surface of membranes as oligosaccharides attached predominantly to the proteins (termed as glycoproteins) or to the lipids (in which case they are called glyco-lipids). The monosaccharide moieties in oligosaccharides include glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose, etc. Carbohydrates of glyco-lipids of RBC cell membrane constitute the antigens of the ABO blood \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   21 24-10-2020   12:07:20"

Glycocalyx refers to the glycoprotein and glycolipid \ncovering that surrounds the cell membrane of certain epithelial and endothelial cells. It protects the cell from digestion and restricts uptake of hydrophobic molecules. In addition, it contributes to cell-cell recog-nition, communication and intercellular adhesion.\nIII. FLUID MOSAIC MODEL OF CELL MEMBRANES \nThe fluid mosaic model was proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. The model has evolved over the time, but it is still the best for explaining the function and structure of the cell membrane. It describes the membrane structure as a mosaic of components\u2014phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins and carbohydrates, that gives the membrane a fluid character. It is likened to integral membrane proteins \u201cicebergs\u201d floating in a sea of fluid phos-pholipid molecules. Salient features explained by the model are (\nFig. 3.3 ):\n\u2022 Phospholipids are the main structural components of the membrane. \nThey have a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails. Phospholipids form a bilayer with heads facing the aqueous medium surrounding the membrane. \n\u2022 The membranes are asymmetric. Some proteins are embedded in the \nouter layer, some in the inner layer and some span the whole membrane. Carbohydrates are attached only on the outer surface forming glycopro-tein and glycolipids. \n\u2022 The membranes are dynamic structures because the position and orien-\ntations of the components keep changing. Phospholipid molecules can undergo rapid lateral diffusion, can rotate around their axis, and can flip-flop. Flip-flop is the migration of phospholipid from one side of the bilayer to the other, though it is not very common.\n\u2022 The fluidity of the membrane is dependent on lipid composition of the \nmembrane. In the bilayer, hydrophobic chains can be ordered to form a \"liquid-ordered\" state. As the temperature rises, the hydrophobic side chains become disordered taking on a more fluid arrangement (liquid-disordered state). This temperature is termed as the transition temperature (T\nm). Presence of unsaturated fatty acids that exist in cis \nconfiguration also increase the fluidity of the bilayer (which means the T m \nis reduced) by decreasing the compactness of the side chain packing.\n\u2022 Cholesterol acts as a buffer to modify the fluidity of membrane. At \ntemperatures below T m, it interferes with the interaction of the tails of \nfatty acids and thus increases fluidity. At temperatures above T m, it limits \nFigure 3.3\nFluid mosaic model of cell membrane.Intracellular spaceExtracellular space\nCholesterolGlycoprotein Integral\nproteinPeripheral\nprotein\nOuter\nleaflet\nInner\nleafletPhospholipid \nbilayer\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   22 24-10-2020   12:07:20"

As the \nfluidity increases, the permeability of water and other small hydrophilic molecules also increases.\n\u2022 The lateral mobility of integral protein increases as the fluidity increases. \nTherefore, lipid phase effects can have a profound effect on a protein in which components span the membrane. The insulin receptor is an excellent example of a protein whose functioning is altered with changes in fluidity. \n\u2022 At normal body temperature (37 \u00b0C), the lipid bilayer is maintained in \na state somewhere between the liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered states, due to the effect of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol present in the membranes. \nIV. MEMBRANE TRANSPORT \nA number of small non-polar molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. can freely diffuse across the membrane, but since the membrane has a prominent hydrophobic core, most of the ions and polar molecules and large hydrophobic molecules are transported across the membranes with the help of specific proteins. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, in other words, permeable to certain substance and not to others. Membrane transport refers to the collective mechanisms that mediate the passage of ions and small molecules through lipid bilayers. The transport across membrane can be broadly classified into passive transport and active transport (\nFigs. 3.4  and 3.5).\nA.

Simple diffusion:  Molecules move passively through the bilayer \nalong the concentration gradient of the molecules on both sides of the membrane, till equilibrium is reached. Non-polar molecules such as gases and steroid hormones freely diffuse across the membrane through this process. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs and at the tissue level is example of simple diffusion.\n 2. Facilitated diffusion:  It is also a type of transport of molecules \nfrom a higher to a lower concentration, but mediated by a specific protein transporter or ion channel. There is no energy expenditure. Facilitated diffusion by transporter proteins is explained with the help of a \u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism. The transporter protein exists in two forms\u2014\"ping\" and \"pong.\" In the \"ping\" state, the protein is exposed to a high concentration of the solute, the solute mole-cules bind to it and bring about a conformational change in the protein to convert it into \"pong\" state. The solute is then released on other side of the membrane. The process is reversible, based on the concentration gradient. The transporter proteins get saturated at higher concentrations of the solute molecules; thus, the rate of diffusion tends to flatten at higher concentrations of the solute.\n   Ion channels are protein molecules that span across the cell \nmembrane allowing the passage of ions. Most of them are highly selective for only one ion. Specific channels for Na\n+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl\u2212 \nhave been identified. They have an aqueous pore, which becomes accessible to ions after a conformational change in the protein struc-ture. These channels can be of 3 types:\n a. Ligand-gated channels  open or close on binding of ligands \n(specific molecule that bind to the receptor). The ligands can be hormones, drugs, or other intercellular messengers, which bind to their receptors to open or close the channels.

Acetylcholine binds to the receptor \nprotein, which triggers the conformational change in the receptor, opening the channel for sodium ions. Rapid move-ment of sodium ions causes membrane depolarization and generation of action potential.\n b. Voltage-gated channels  respond to the change in electrical \npotential across the membrane, which causes it to open. Voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage-gated potas-sium channels are the examples of such channels. These are involved in conduction of nerve impulses. Opening of sodium channel causes influx of Na\n+ into the cells causing depolariza-\ntion, whereas closing of sodium channel coupled with opening of potassium channel causes K\n+ influx, result in repolarization.\n c. Mechanically-gated channels or mechanosensitive chan-\nnels  respond to various mechanical stimuli. They are impor-\ntant components of various sensory receptors that respond to touch, pressure, sound, vibration, etc.\nThe kinetics of ions channels are different from that of trans-\nporters\u2014they are not saturable, and can achieve diffusion rates nearly equal to that of ions diffusing unhindered in solutions. \nThe concentrations of many transporter proteins and ion chan-\nnels in the plasma membrane are regulated by hormones; this is achieved either by increasing the synthesis of the proteins that form these channels and transporters, or by translocating the transporter proteins from cytoplasm to the membrane.  \nFor example, \n\u2022 Insulin promotes glucose uptake by adipocytes and muscle \ntissues by facilitating the translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) from an intracellular pool to the cell membrane. \n\u2022 Aldosterone is involved in renal sodium reabsorption. It \nincreases the production of epithelial sodium (Na) channels (ENaCs) in the renal tubular cells that are involved in this process.\nB. Active transport \nIt involves transport against a concentration gradient. This process requires energy and involves specific transporter proteins known as pumps.\n 1. ATP-driven pumps:  The transport is directly coupled with hydro-\nlysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi); this is also called primary active transport. Most common example of this is Na\n+-K+ \nATPase  which drives Na+ out of the cell, and K+ into the cell, and \ngenerates what is termed as membrane potential. Another example is multidrug resistance-1 protein (MDR-1 protein). This protein pumps certain drugs out of the cells, and therefore, is an important cause of resistance to chemotherapy.\n 2. Coupled transporters or cotransporters:  The transport of one \nsolute against a concentration gradient is coupled with transport of another  along its electrochemical gradient. This is also termed Aquaporins are tetrameric \ntransmembrane proteins that form channels in the cell membranes for trans-port of molecules, especially water. These water channels augment the movement of water by facilitated diffusion. They selectively permit the passage of water and exclude the passage of ions, because the pores are too narrow to allow passage of larger ions.  \nAquaporins play a very impor-tant role in the water balance of the body. In case of a rela-tive lowering of the body water content, antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin) is secreted from the hypothal-amus. ADH causes translo-cation of aquaporins from cytoplasm to the basolateral membrane of the collecting duct cells, promoting reab-sorption of water from the renal tubules, thereby restoring the body water volume.\nMutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein which acts as an ATP-dependent chloride channel, results in cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease, character-ized by decreased transport of Cl\n\u2013 across the membranes, \nalong with a diminished trans-port of water. In most of the tissues, this results in decreased chloride and water content of the luminal contents\u2014leading to manifestations like thick respiratory secretions predis-posing to infections, stagna-tion of secretions of pancreatic enzymes causing pancreatitis and decreased levels of pancre-atic enzymes in the intestines leading to impaired fat and protein absorption, plugging of bile ducts by thick biliary secre-tions, etc. In sweat glands, the reabsorption of chloride is compromised, leading to increased sweat chloride levels.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   25 24-10-2020   12:07:21"

UCP-1 can insert into the inner mitochondrial membrane and dissi-pate the proton gradient which is required for the formation of ATP .

Such vesicles are surrounded by lipid \nbilayer with an aqueous interior. They are used clinically as carriers of drugs targeted to specific organs.\n\u2022 Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by an inherited defect in the red cell cytoskeleton. Most commonly it is due to a \ndeficiency of spectrin but it can also arise due to mutations in proteins like ankyrin, which is a peripheral membrane protein, and band 3 protein, which is an integral membrane protein in the RBC membrane, to which the cytoskeleton is linked via ankyrin. As a result of these defects, the cells are not able to maintain the biconcave shape and becomes more spherical in shape. Life span of RBCs is decreased because these are easily destroyed in the spleen, as their traverse through the splenic capillaries are slowed down\u2014this leads to anemia.\n\u2022 Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors. As a \nresult, the receptors cannot be activated by acetylcholine and the muscle cells containing these receptors cannot respond to the neurotransmitter- mediated stimulus. Thus, muscle contraction is impaired. A main symptom is muscle fatigue. The treatment consists of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs prevent the break down of acetylcho-line in the neuromuscular junctions, allowing acetylcholine to be present at the neuromuscular junction for an extended period and in higher amounts, stimulating the remaining receptors. Immunosuppressants are also used to reduce the generation of antibodies against the receptor.\n\u2022 Many viruses and bacterial toxins gain their entry into the cell by binding to various components of the cell membrane. \nVibrio cholerae produces cholera toxin which binds to membrane glycolipids, diphtheria toxin binds to a protein receptor at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and SARS-CoV-2 (the causative of novel coronavirus disease\u2014COVID-19) binds to another protein known as ACE2 receptor (ACE is angiotensin-converting enzyme).\n\u2022 In the small intestine, glucose and Na\n+ bind to different sites on Na+-glucose symporter (also known as sodium glucose \ntransporter or SGLT) at the apical surface of the cells. Na+ moves into the cell down its electrochemical gradient and \ndrags glucose with it. To maintain a steep Na+ gradient, Na+-glucose symporter is dependent upon  Na+-K+ ATPase  \nlocated at the basolateral membrane, which maintains a low intracellular concentration of Na+ by pumping it out of \nthe cell. The treatment of a patient suffering from diarrhea (e.g., in food poisoning and cholera) makes use of this information. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), consisting of NaCI and glucose, has been developed by World Health Organization (WHO) for administration during dehydration in diarrhea. The transport of glucose and Na\n+ across the \nintestinal epithelial cells forces movement of water from lumen of the gut into intestinal cells, resulting in rehydration. Glucose alone or NaCI alone would not be effective.\n\u2022 Fluidity of neuronal membranes is crucial in their functions, as many of the critical functions carried out by \nneurons, including neurotransmitter release and amino acid uptake for protein synthesis rely on membrane fluidity. Docosahexaenoic acid ( Docosa  \u2013 twenty-two, hexa  \u2013 six, ene \u2013 double bond), commonly known as DHA, is a 22-carbon \nPUFA, widely used as a food additive. Neuronal membranes are rich in DHA, where it increases the fluidity of the membrane, due to the presence of six double bonds in its structure.\n\u2022 In many membrane glycerophospholipids, the second carbon of glycerol is esterified to arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon \npolyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that contains four double bonds. Arachidonic acid acts as a precursor for a large family of molecules known as eicosanoids (eicosa\u2014twenty). These include inflammatory mediators like prostaglan-dins and thromboxanes. One mechanism by which corticosteroids, widely used anti-inflammatory molecules, exert their action is by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids, thus preventing the formation of eicosanoids.\n\u2022 Sitosterols are a type of plant sterols or phytosterols. They are present in the diet, but in normal individuals only minimal  \nquantities of sitosterols are absorbed, most of which are eliminated in the bile. Sitosterolemia refers to a rare genetic disease due to mutations in the transporters that promote the secretion of absorbed sitosterols from intestinal epithe-lial cells into the intestinal lumen, or biliary canalicular cells into biliary canaliculi. Accumulation of sitosterols in the membrane, instead of cholesterol, leads to membrane abnormalities in the RBCs. The patients are also at risk for lipid accumulation and atherosclerosis.\n\u2022 The release of vesicles containing neurotransmitters is important in nerve conduction and muscle contraction. The \nexocytosis of these vesicles is inhibited by botulinum toxin, one of the most potent toxins in existence, produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic bacterium. Botulism is a rare, but potentially fatal disease caused due to infec-tion by C. botulinum. It usually results from consumption of food contaminated by the bacteria, and can progress to \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   27 24-10-2020   12:07:21"

Chapter Summary\nMembranes are dynamic structures composed of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. The fluid mosaic model forms the \nbasis for understanding membrane structure and function. Basically, all membranes are lipid bilayers formed by two layers of phospholipids. The polar heads of phospholipids are in the aqueous environment on the outer and inner surface of membrane. Fatty acid chains face the interior of the bilayer. The fluidity of the membrane is due to presence of choles-terol and unsaturated fatty acids. Two types of proteins are present in the cell, integral or intrinsic proteins and peripheral  \nproteins. Various passive and active transport mechanisms are employed to maintain the gradient of different molecules across different membranes. Large molecules enter or leave the cell through endocytosis or exocytosis. Mutations that affect the structure of membrane proteins may cause different diseases. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   28 24-10-2020   12:07:21"

A 1-year-old girl child of Caucasian background \nwas brought to the clinic by her mother. She had been feverish for the past 24 hours and was coughing frequently. The mother stated that her daughter had experienced 3 attacks of bronchitis since birth. The mother had also noted that her daughter had been passing somewhat bulky, foul-smelling stools for the past several months and was not gaining weight as expected for age. The physician ordered for a sweat chloride test and sweat chloride was found to be elevated.\nA. What is the probable diagnosis?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Stagnation of secretions in the pancreatic \nduct leads to decreased levels of these enzymes in the intestinal lumen, impairing fat and protein absorption. Presence of undigested fat causes bulky, foul-smelling stools.\nB. What is the reason for bulky, foul-smelling \nstools?Answer\u2014C:  CFTR protein is a chloride channel. Mutations \nin CFTR leads to decreased transport of Cl\u2212 across the \nmembranes, along with a diminished transport of water. In most of the tissues, this results in decreased chloride and water in the luminal contents\u2014leading to manifestations like thick respiratory secretions predisposing to infections, stagnation of secretions of pancreatic enzymes causing pancreatitis and decreased levels of pancreatic enzymes in the intestines leading to impaired fat and protein absorp-tion, plugging of bile ducts by thick biliary secretions, etc. In sweat glands, the reabsorption of chloride is compro-mised, leading to increased sweat chloride levels.C.

In the intestinal epithe-lial cells, absorption of glucose is dependent on sodium, via the SGLT1 transporter.

OVERVIEW\nAccording to Bronsted-Lowry model, acids are molecules that can donate \nH+ (i.e., protons), which are accepted by bases. The concentration of H+ \nions in the body fluids varies greatly\u2014from ~10\u22126 mmol/l in the pancreatic \nsecretions to ~10 mmol/l in the gastric juice; expressing the H+ concentra-\ntion in conventional units (mmol/l or mol/l) is hence inconvenient. Further, the H\n+ concentration in the blood is physiologically maintained within a \nnarrow range. The severity of the subtle changes in H+ concentration of \nblood will not be reflected if expressed in mmol/l. To thwart these prob-lems, pH scale is used to denote H\n+ concentration in biological systems, \nsimilar to the way it is used in those chemical systems where H+ concen-\ntrations are low.\npH is the negative logarithm (to the base 10) of the H+ activity expressed in \nmoles/liter ( Note: In this and all the subsequent discussions, we will consider \n\u201cactivity\u201d same as \u201cconcentration\u201d, though \u201cactivity\u201d is the \u201cconcentration\u201d of a substance, after adjustments are made for intermolecular interactions. ) \nSince the pH of the intracellular and the extracellular milieu is to be main-\ntained within a narrow range, various short-term and long-term mecha-nisms are adopted by the body to ensure this. Alterations in the pH leading to values outside the physiological limits lead to cell dysfunction. The pH of the arterial blood is 7.35\u20137.45. Acidemia refers to a pH <7.35 and alka-lemia, a pH >7.45. The processes that lead to acidemia and alkalemia are termed acidosis and alkalosis, respectively. Both acidosis and alkalosis, when severe, can be fatal.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Define acid, base, pH and buffer\n\u2022 Discuss major buffer systems in body\u2022 Explain how the pH of blood is maintained\u2022 Describe acid-base disorders and compensatory mechanisms\u2022 Describe the significance of ABG analysis\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   31 24-10-2020   12:07:21"

MAINTENANCE OF pH IN THE BODY\nThe pH of intracellular fluid in most of the cells is maintained between 6.0 \nand 7.4, the exact values varying with different cell types. The maintenance of optimum pH is important for enzyme activity and cell metabolism, gener-ation of membrane potential, functioning of ion channels and transporters, and in the functioning of organelles and cytoskeleton.\nOxidation of carbon fuels in the body for generation of energy results in \nproduction of acids such as carbonic acid during the citric acid cycle and generation of lactic acid during glycolysis. Because of the production of acids by the cells, the pH of venous blood (7.32\u20137.38) is slightly lower than that of the arterial blood (7.35\u20137.45). Volatile acids (e.g., carbonic acid in the form of CO\n2) are removed from the body via lungs, while non-volatile or \nfixed acids (e.g., lactic acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid) are excreted in the urine. Approximately 80 mmol of non-volatile acids is produced by the body via metabolism. \nA number of states, physiological and pathological, can lead to buildup \nor loss of H\n+ from the body, but the body has inherent mechanisms oper-\nating to maintain the pH in the optimal range. This section describes the three mechanisms that operate at different levels to defend the alteration in the body pH\u2014buffers, respiratory regulation, and renal regulation. The time frame and effects of their actions vary. Buffers act immediately but for a short duration, while renal mechanisms set in after some hours to days and are sustained; respiratory regulation of pH occurs after a few minutes of deviation of pH from the normal. Aberrations in acid-base balance occur when these mechanisms dysfunction or are overwhelmed.\nA. Buffers\nA buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its strong conjugate base (or a weak base and its strong conjugate acid) which resists changes in pH of the solution that contains it. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a weak acid and its strong conjugate base states that:\npH = pK a + log  [Conjugate base ]\n[Acid]\nwhere, K a is the dissociation constant of the acid. \nThe pH of a buffer is thus determined by two factors\u2014the pKa, and the \nrelative concentration of conjugate base and acid. Buffering capacity is the ability of a buffer to resist the change in pH, when an acid or a base is added to the solution containing the buffer. Quantitatively, it can be expressed as the number of moles of a strong acid or a strong base required to alter the pH of 1 liter of a buffer solution by 1. Buffering capacity is maximum when the pH of the solution is pK\na \u00b1 1; it also \ndepends on the amount of buffer present in the system. Since different body fluid compartments differ in their composition (see Fig. 5.2, p. 51), the major buffers in body fluids also vary. Table 1 (see p. 71) gives the list of buffers in different body fluids. Their roles and significance are described below.\n 1. Bicarbonate buffer:  The bicarbonate buffer system consists of \nH\n2CO 3, and its conjugate base\u2014HCO 3\u2212. When a strong acid (denoted \nas HA) is added to the system, H+ combines with HCO 3\u2212 to form \nH2CO 3 and A\u2212, which being a weak acid and a weak base, respec-\ntively, will not affect the pH drastically: HA + HCO 3\u2212 \u2192 H2CO 3 + A\u2212\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   32 24-10-2020   12:07:21"

Maintenance of pH in the Body 33\n   A strong base (denoted as AOH) when added, reacts with H 2CO 3 to \nform its bicarbonate salt and water\u2014again resisting the change in the pH: AOH + H\n2CO 3 \u2192 AHCO 3 + H 2O\n   Despite a pK a of 6.1 which is outside the \u00b1 1 range from the blood \npH of 7.4, bicarbonate buffer is the major buffer of the extracellular fluid (ECF). There are two factors that facilitate the efficient func-tioning of bicarbonate buffer in the ECF:\n  a. An unusually high ratio of 20 between the conjugate base and the \nacid (i.e., HCO 3\u2013 and dissolved CO 2) seen in the bicarbonate buffer \nsystem draws its maximal buffering action towards the physiolog-ical pH, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n b. The levels of pCO\n2 and HCO 3\u2212  in the ECF are regulated by the \nlungs and the kidneys (see B. Respiratory Regulation of pH, p. 34 and C. Renal Regulation of pH, p. 36). This enables a fine control of the pH, since these components can be removed (and in case of HCO\n3\u2212, added) to keep the pH within the optimal range.\n   Note: An open system buffer is one in which both the compo-\nnents of the buffer (acid and its conjugate base/base and its conjugate acid) can be removed from the body. Since CO\n2 is \nremoved by the lungs, and HCO 3\u2212 by the kidneys, the bicar-\nbonate buffer system is an example of an open buffer system. In contrast, closed system buffers do not have any gas equili-bration, i.e., they do not have any removal of the components at the pulmonary level; at the best, one of the components may be removed by the kidneys. Closed system buffers in the human body include phosphate, protein, and hemoglobin buffers. \n 2. Phosphate buffer:  Three pK\na values are possible for phosphoric \nacid (H 3PO4), since it is a triprotic acid.\n   H3PO4 \u21cc H2PO4\u2212 + H+ pK 1 = 2.1\n   H2PO4\u2212 \u21cc HPO 42\u2212 + H+ pK 2 = 6.8\n   HPO 42\u2212 \u21cc PO 43\u2212 + H+ pK 3 = 12.3\n   Since the pK 2 of 6.8 is close to the physiological pH, the compo-\nnents of phosphate buffer in the physiological systems are HPO 42\u2212 \nand H 2PO4\u2212. They are present in a ratio of 4:1. \n Despite the optimal pH for buffering close to that of the ECF, phos-\nphate buffer does not play a predominant role in defending the ECF pH. This is because of low levels of both HPO\n42\u2212 and H 2PO4\u2212 in \nthe ECF. However, intracellular fluid is rich in organic and inorganic phosphates (see Fig. 5.2, p. 51); thus, phosphate buffer is a major buffer system of the cell. Similarly, it also acts as a major buffer in the renal tubules, where phosphate concentrations are high, and the pH is much closer to pK\n2 of H 3PO4 than the pH of the ECF.\n 3. Protein and hemoglobin buffers:  Proteins form an important buffer \nsystem in the blood and the intracellular fluid due to their sheer abundance in these fluids. The buffering action of proteins (including hemoglobin) is conferred by the constituent amino acids. Individual amino acids have at least two ionizable groups\u2014the \u03b1-amino \ngroup (pK\na: 3.1) and the \u03b1-carboxyl group (pK a: 8.0). However, \nsince these moieties are involved in the formation of peptide bonds (see Fig. 7.2, p. 89 ), only the N-terminal \u03b1-amino group and the \nC-terminal \u03b1-carboxyl group are free and ionizable, and hence avail-\nable for buffering action (Note: Among these, the \u03b1-amino group has \na pK\na of 3.1 and does not play much of a role at the body pH).

            "Text": "34 4. Acid-Base Balance and Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis\nthe buffering brought about by proteins is mainly due to the ioniz-\nable side chains (or R-groups \u2013 see Fig. 6.1, p. 75).\n Although seven amino acids have ionizable R groups (the amino \nacids with 3 pK a values shown in Fig. 6.3, p. 77), only the imidazole \ngroup of histidine and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine have pK a \nvalues near the physiological pH (6.0 and 8.3, respectively). Since histidine residues are much more common in proteins than cyste-ines (e.g., one molecule of hemoglobin contains 38 histidine resi-dues and 6 cysteine residues), the former is the major contributor to the buffering action of proteins at the physiological pH (\nFig. 4.1 ).\n   Even though buffers are able to defend the alterations in the pH \nwithin a fraction of a second, they cannot remove excess acids or bases from the body. For this, the body relies on certain other mechanisms that involve the lungs or the kidneys.\nB. Respiratory regulation of pH\nIn the body, gaseous exchange (between O 2 and CO 2) occurs at two \nsites\u2014pulmonary capillaries and capillaries of peripheral tissues. CO\n2, the product of tissue respiration, diffuses from the cell into the \ntissue fluid, and at the capillary interface, diffuses across the capillary membrane into the blood. CO\n2 is transported to the pulmonary capil-\nlaries from the tissue capillaries by three mechanisms ( Fig. 4.2 ):\n1. CO 2 enters the red blood cells (RBCs) where it reacts with water in \npresence of an enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, to form carbonic acid (H\n2CO 3); the latter then dissociates to form H+ and HCO 3\u2212. H+ reacts \nwith oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2\u2212) to release oxygen and form deoxyhe-\nmoglobin (HHb), the so-called Bohr effect. HCO 3\u2212, as more quan-\ntities are formed, is transported from RBCs into the plasma by an anion exchanger protein, in exchange for chloride from the plasma; this is called Hamburger phenomenon. Transport in the form of HCO\n3\u2212 accounts for about 70% of the total CO 2 transported.\n2. CO 2 also directly reacts with the N-terminal amino groups of the \nglobin chains of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin. This accounts for nearly 20% of the total CO\n2 transported.\n3. Nearly 10% of CO 2 is transported in the dissolved state, in the \nvenous blood.\nThus, CO 2 is transported in the venous blood without much of a change \nin the pH.\nIn the pulmonary capillaries where O 2 tension is high and CO 2 tension \nis low, CO 2 is exchanged for O 2, by a reversal of the above mecha-\nnisms ( Fig. 4.2 ). Increased O 2 levels decrease the CO 2 and H+ binding \nto hemoglobin; this is known as Haldane effect. CO 2 thus released from \ncarbaminohemoglobin, and that is formed as a reversal of the carbonic anhydrase reaction, diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli, to enter the expired air.\nLungs regulate the pH by controlling the CO\n2 levels in the blood. This is \nachieved by controlling the rate of respiration, which is ultimately deter-mined by a set of receptors known as chemoreceptors.\nCentral chemoreceptors in the respiratory center located in the medulla of \nthe brain control the rate of ventilation and the tidal volume. Accumulation of CO\n2 leads to an involuntary increase in the rate and depth of ventila-\ntion, resulting in expiration of an increased amount of CO 2. A converse \nhappens when pH is increased or CO 2 levels in blood are low.+N\nNN\nH\nHpKa = 6.0NH\nR\nR\nFigure 4.1\nBuffering action by imidazole group of \nhistidine.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   34 24-10-2020   12:07:22"

Renal regulation of pH\nIn acidemia and alkalemia, kidneys conserve or excrete the acids and \nthe bases, as the case may be, to restore the normal pH. Four mecha-nisms are employed by the kidneys to achieve this: \n1. Bicarbonate reabsorption:  In thick ascending loop of Henle, \nHCO\n3\u2212 is totally reabsorbed, without net excretion of H+ (Fig. 4.3 ).\n2.

Thus, alternate means are required to \nexcrete H+ in the urine, that do not involve any subsequent reduc-\ntion in pH. This is achieved by combining H+ of the tubular fluid with \nphosphates and ammonia.\n\u2022 H+ generated by the intercalated cells combines with HPO 42\u2212 to \ngenerate H 2PO4\u2212; the latter is excreted as NaH 2PO4 (Fig. 4.5 ).\n\u2022 Ammonium ion (NH 4+) is produced mainly in the proximal tubules \nfrom glutamine by the action of the enzyme glutaminase. The product glutamate undergoes further metabolism to produce another NH\n4+ and two HCO 3\u2212 molecules ( Fig. 4.6 ). \n In the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, NH 4+ re-enters the \ntubular cells via Na+-K+-2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (taking the place of \nK+) and then enters the interstitium, where it dissociates into NH 3 \nand H+ (Fig. 4.7 ). In the collecting duct, NH 3 re-enters the lumen \nvia specific transporters and combines with H+ to form NH 4+, \nwhich is excreted as NH 4Cl.\n4. New bicarbonate generation: Apart from the reabsorption of \nfiltered HCO 3\u2212, kidneys also play a role in replenishing the HCO 3\u2212 \nreserve in the body. The glutaminase reaction will ultimately result in the generation of two HCO\n3\u2212 molecules that enter the blood. A \ncloser look at Figures 4.4 , 4.5 and 4.7 also reveals that the activity \nof H+-ATPase , and the buffering action of the phosphate buffer or \nNH3\u2014lead to one HCO 3\u2212 molecule transported into the plasma, per \nproton that enters the luminal fluid.\n In physiological states, renal tubules produce sufficient H+ to \nre-absorb almost all of the HCO 3\u2212 that is filtered by the glomeruli. \nAn amount of H+ produced in excess of this ensures the removal of \nthe 80 mmol of non-volatile acids produced in the body. In acidosis, the H\n+ secretion by the renal tubules is increased, so as to facilitate \nH+ excretion; HCO 3\u2212 is conserved\u2014this brings about an increase in \nthe pH of the blood. The opposite happens in case of alkalosis.\n The signals to the kidneys to regulate the secretion of H+ (and reab-\nsorption of HCO 3\u2212) are summarized in Table 2 (see p. 71).Anion-exchanger\nprotein\nLumenCarbonic\nanhydrase\nCO2 CO2 + H2O  H2CO3 + H+ H+ Na+\n H+ K+\n K+\nHCO3 HCO3 \nHPO42 \nCl Cl H+\u2013ATPaseK+\u2013H+\u2013ATPaseInterstitium Intercalated cell\nH2PO4 \nNaH2PO4 \nFigure 4.5\nPhosphates form an important urine buffer by combining with H+ in the lumen.\nFigure 4.6\nMetabolism of glutamine and its \nproducts in the proximal tubules generates 2NH\n4+ and 2HCO 3\u2013.Glutamine Glucose\nPhosphoenolpyruvate\nPEP\ncarboxykinase\nOxalocetaleGTP\nCitric acid cycleGlutaminase\nGlutamate\nGlutamate\ndehydrogenase\n\u03b1\u2013KetoglutarateHCO3 \nHCO3 NH4+ \nNH4+ \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   37 24-10-2020   12:07:23"

Respiratory Disorders with an Abnormal Acid-Base Status 39\nSince buffers act as the first line of defense against the alterations in \nthe pH, the aberrations in the pH of the body can be determined by looking at the status of the buffers.\nAcidemia refers to a blood pH <7.35, and the conditions leading to it are \nreferred to as acidosis. This occurs when the ratio of HCO\n3\u2212 to pCO 2 is \ndecreased. When this occurs due to an increase in the pCO 2, the condi-\ntion is referred to as respiratory acidosis; if the fall in the ratio is due to a decrease in the HCO\n3\u2212 levels, the term used is metabolic acidosis. \nAlkalemia refers to a blood pH >7.45, and the conditions leading to it are referred to as alkalosis. The ratio of HCO\n3\u2212 to pCO 2 is increased. \nRespiratory alkalosis occurs when there is a decrease in the pCO 2; \nincrease in the HCO 3\u2212 levels lead to metabolic alkalosis (see p. 72).\nPresence of any one of the above-mentioned disorders, along with \nappropriate compensation constitutes \u201csimple acid-base disorders.\u201d It is also not uncommon to encounter situations when the acid-base disturbance is caused by more than one primary abnormality. Such disorders are known as \u201cmixed acid-base disorders.\u201d \nIII.  RESPIRATORY DISORDERS WITH AN ABNORMAL \nACID-BASE STATUS\nRespiratory acidosis is characterized by an increase in the pCO 2 of the \nblood and a decrease in the pH. The compensation is by the kidneys, which results in an increase in the HCO\n3\u2212 in the blood. In disorders where \nthe function of the respiratory center is intact, the increase in pCO 2 also \nincreases the rate and depth of ventilation, to eliminate excess CO 2 from \nthe body.\nRespiratory alkalosis results from a decrease in the pCO 2 of the blood and \nan increase in the pH. The renal compensation results in conservation of H\n+ and excretion of HCO 3\u2212. \nA. Respiratory acidosis\nRespiratory acidosis almost always results from CO 2 retention in the \nbody (hypercapnia). Clinical features of respiratory acidosis will be predominantly that of the underlying disorder. However, CO\n2 has a vaso-\ndilatory effect on cerebral vessels\u2014CO 2 accumulation intrinsically can \nlead to neurological manifestations like headache, drowsiness, confu-sion, and even coma. The cause of CO\n2 retention can be an abnormality \nof the respiratory center (e.g., infections or tumors involving the central nervous system), or respiratory muscle paralysis or fatigue (e.g., in polio-myelitis, muscular dystrophies, etc.) or disease afflictions of airways and lungs (e.g., severe asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc.), or conditions that restrict ventilation (e.g., rib fracture, skeletal deformities, etc.).\nB. Respiratory alkalosis\nA decrease in the pCO 2 or hypocapnia is caused by an increase in the \nrate and/or depth of ventilation. As the vasodilatory effect due to CO 2 \non cerebral vessels is abrogated, a decline in the cerebral blood flow leads to clinical manifestations like confusion, drowsiness and seizures. Alkalosis also increases the binding of free Ca\n2+ in the circulation to \nalbumin, leading on to sudden reduction in the levels of free Ca2+ and \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   39 24-10-2020   12:07:24"

This is seen in hypoxia at high altitudes, hypoxia due to severe anemia and cardiac disorders, salicylate poisoning, in anxious individ-uals, etc. Respiratory alkalosis also results from overvigorous mechan-ical ventilation.\nIV.  METABOLIC DISORDERS WITH AN ABNORMAL \nACID-BASE STATUS\nMetabolic acidosis is associated with a reduction in the HCO 3\u2212 levels and \na decrease in the pH. The compensation by respiratory mechanisms, i.e., increase in the tidal volume and the rate of ventilation, leads to a reduc-tion in pCO\n2.\nMetabolic alkalosis results in an increase in the HCO 3\u2212 levels and an \nincrease in the pH. Respiratory compensation leads to retention of CO 2 \nand an increase in pCO 2.\nA. Metabolic acidosis\nMetabolic acidosis can result broadly from four scenarios\u2014production of fixed acids which exceeds the body\u2019s capacity to eliminate them, addition of fixed acids to the body by ingestion or infusion, reduction of H\n+ excretion by the kidneys, and loss of HCO 3\u2212 from the body. However, \nfor the ease of determining the etiology clinically, metabolic acidosis is classified based on the effect exerted by the underlying disorder on the anion gap.\nAnion gap: The concentrations of anions and cations in the plasma \nare equal, so that the electrical neutrality is maintained. However, since routine laboratory analysis of plasma electrolytes involves only selected electrolytes, there exists a gap between the measured cations and measured anions (\nFig. 4.8 ). Since Na+ is the primarily measured cation \nand Cl\u2212 and HCO 3\u2212 are the anions that are primarily measured, plasma \nanion gap = [Na+] \u2212 ([Cl\u2212] + [HCO 3\u2212]), all values in mmol/l . The reference \ninterval for anion gap is 12 \u00b1 4 mmol/l.\nNote: The formula for calculation of anion gap given above is based on \nthe convention followed in the United States. According to the European conventions, K\n+ is also included in the calculation, so the formula gets \nmodified to: plasma anion gap = ([Na+] + [K+]) \u2212 ([Cl\u2212] + [ HCO 3\u2212]), and \nthe reference interval also gets altered accordingly.\nAnion gap is thus, an indicator of unmeasured anions. Unmeasured \ncations include K+, free Ca2+, Mg2+, and cationic immunoglobulins \n(e.g., IgG); unmeasured anions include anionic proteins like albumin and anionic immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA), phosphates, sulfates, lactates, and ketone bodies. Anion gap can also be expressed as (unmeasured anions \u2212 unmeasured cations).\nA reduction in the anion gap is seen due to a reduction in the unmea-\nsured anions (e.g., in hypoalbuminemia due to decrease in albumin) or an increase in the unmeasured cations (seen in lithium toxicity and in multiple myeloma when producing high levels of IgG). However, the most common cause of a reduced anion gap is laboratory error! So, Figure 4.8\nAnion gap is the difference between \nmeasured cation and measured anions (or alternatively unmeasured anions \u2013 unmeasured cations).Plasma\nUnmeasured\nanionsMeasured\nanionsUnmeasured\ncationsMeasured\ncationOthersOthers\nProteins\nChlorideBicarbonate\n Na+\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   40 24-10-2020   12:07:24"

A high \nanion gap is seen when unmeasured anions are increased (e.g., hyper-phosphatemia, or in multiple myeloma when producing high levels of IgA)\u2014in these conditions, the pH of the blood is normal. However, most commonly, an increase in the plasma anion gap is associated with meta-bolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is thus classified into high anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-(or normal) anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n 1. High anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Here non-measured anions \naccumulate, with a decrease in the blood pH. As H\n+ is removed from \nthe body, HCO 3\u2212 is correspondingly decreased. Causes include: \na. Lactic acidosis\u2014seen in tissue hypoxia (type A), and without \ntissue hypoxia (type B) in disorders of electron transport system and citric acid cycle. Since aerobic metabolism is compromised, pyruvate is converted to lactate, instead of getting converted to acetyl CoA (Chapter 13. V.K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate, p. 199). It is also seen in type 1a and 1b glycogen storage diseases, due to an increased flux through glycolysis (Fig. 16.8, p. 230).\nb. Accumulation of acetoacetate and/or \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate\u2014seen \nin diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 21, V.C. Excessive ketone body production in diabetes mellitus, p. 314), prolonged star-vation (Fig. 28.12, p. 460) and excess ethanol consumption (Chapter 27. IV.C.4. Alcohol-related hypoglycemia, p. 445).\nc. Renal failure\u2014due to impaired excretion of sulfuric, phosphoric \nand organic acids produced in the body.\nd. Toxicity due to accumulation of anions\u2014seen in poisoning with \nmethanol, ethylene glycol, paraldehyde, salicylate, etc.\n 2. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  This arises due to a direct \nloss of fluid rich in bicarbonate from the gastrointestinal tract or the renal tubule. To maintain the electrical neutrality of the blood, chlo-ride is reabsorbed in excess leading onto hyperchloremia. Since a measured anion (HCO\n3\u2212) is replaced by another measured anion \n(Cl\u2212), the anion gap remains more or less normal.\na. Gastrointestinal causes include severe diarrhea, and intestinal \nfistula, where bicarbonate-rich fluid in the gastrointestinal tract is not properly reabsorbed.\nb. Renal causes include:\ni. Administration of drugs like acetazolamide which inhibit \ncarbonic anhydrase  in the proximal tubule, thereby \ndecreasing the H\n+ secretion into the lumen from the tubular \ncells, impeding the HCO 3\u2212 reabsorption.\nii. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)\u2014These are clinical conditions in \nwhich metabolic acidosis ensues because of a failure in the acidification of the urine (i.e., excretion of H\n+ or reabsorption \nof HCO 3\u2212) by the kidneys, despite an intact glomerular filtra-\ntion rate.\nMetabolic acidosis is clinically characterized by the features of the under-\nlying disorder. Otherwise, a typical finding is a characteristic ventilation with increased depth rather than the rate, known as Kussmaul respiration.Salicylate alters the metabo-\nlism and produces different organic acids, leading onto metabolic acidosis. Salicylate also stimulates the respiratory center to increase the rate and depth of ventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis. Since there is more than one primary disorder involved, salicylate poisoning is an example of mixed acid-base disorder.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   41 24-10-2020   12:07:24"

Metabolic alkalosis\nMetabolic alkalosis can result broadly from two scenarios\u2014addition of \nexogenous HCO 3\u2212 into the body, or reduced elimination of HCO 3\u2212 from \nthe body. Reduced elimination of HCO 3\u2212 is from a renal retention of \nHCO 3\u2212 which occurs in response to acid loss from the body, or when \nhypovolemia/hyponatremia leads to increased renal Na+ (and hence \nHCO 3\u2212) absorption. Metabolic alkalosis can also result from hypoka-\nlemia, and also due to increased levels or action of mineralocorticoids. The causes and mechanisms are detailed below, and in \nFigure 4.9 .\n1. Exogenous HCO 3\u2212 or base administration: Overtreatment with \nNaHCO 3\u2212 (e.g., in hyponatremia or in metabolic acidosis), or massive \nblood transfusions leading to citrate overload (citrate is used as an anticoagulant in stored blood).\n2. Hypovolemia leading to alkalosis is seen in vomiting where both \nfluid and H\n+ loss occur. In addition, hypovolemia (and accompa-\nnying hyponatremia) as such can lead to alkalosis because of (1) increased renal Na\n+ reabsorption, which is accompanied by HCO 3\u2212 \nreabsorption and (2) stimulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) (see Chapter 5, Section III.C. Hormones regulate renal handling of Na\n+ and K+, p. 56)\u2014renin increases Na+-H+-\nexchanger activity, aldosterone increases H+-ATPase  activity, and \nthus loss of H+ in urine.\n3. Hypokalemia leads to acidification of urine and increased blood \npH, by increasing the activity of K+-H+ ATPase , and increasing the \nexpression of NH 3 transporters in the collecting duct ( Fig. 4.7 ).\n4. Increased plasma aldosterone levels as seen in Conn\u2019s syndrome \n(aldosterone-secreting tumor of adrenal cortex) or in adrenal hyper-plasia cause metabolic alkalosis by increasing the H\n+-ATPase  \nactivity, and by causing hypokalemia.\nClinical features of metabolic alkalosis, apart from that of the under-\nlying disorder, include hypoventilation (as a compensation by the respi-ratory center) and features of hypocalcemia like tingling and numbness. \nWhatever be the cause of acid-base imbalance determination of the \ntype and the severity is not possible solely on the basis of clinical features, because of the varied underlying causes and the mechanisms. Diagnosis is thus made with the help of a number of tests, collectively known as ABG analysis. \nV. ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS (ABG) ANALYSIS\nArterial blood gas refers to a battery of tests that includes estimation of pH, oxygen tension (pO\n2), carbon dioxide tension (pCO 2), HCO 3\u2212 concentration, \nand oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (sO 2) in arterial blood. Specialized \ninstruments are also available for measurement of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels.\nA. Indications for performing an ABG analysis\nABG analysis is performed to evaluate the acid-base status and the O\n2-CO 2 gas exchange in an individual.

Sample collection for ABG analysis\nThe arterial blood is obtained via percutaneous needle puncture or from an indwelling arterial catheter, the former being more commonly performed.\nThe preferred sites of needle puncture sampling are radial artery, \nbrachial artery, femoral artery, axillary artery, and dorsalis pedis artery, in that order. In infants, the sample can also be collected from the temporal artery.\nHeparin is the anticoagulant of choice for ABG sample. Heparin can be \nin the form of lyophilized heparin or heparin solution. When the latter is used, the syringe is flushed with heparin solution, not allowing any liquid to remain behind. Lyophilized heparin is preferred because any inad-vertent persistence of liquid heparin (which has pO\n2 and pCO 2 values \nof atmospheric air) will dilute the sample, leading to erroneous results.\nPrecautions while collecting the sample:\n\u2022 The samples should be collected under strict aseptic conditions.\u2022 Contact of the sample with air should be prevented.\u2022 Heparin must be completely removed from the syringe (when \nheparin solution is used).\n\u2022 The sample should be transported to the analyzer without any \ndelay. This is very important especially in patients with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, as WBCs and platelets use up oxygen and generate carbon dioxide, as the analysis is delayed. Delay also will lead to diffusion of gases through the plastic syringes. To avoid the delay in transportation, ABG analysis is nowadays done as POCT (Point-of-Care Testing), placing the analyzers at the point of sample collection (like ICUs and wards).\n\u2022 Samples should NOT be transported on ice when plastic syringes \nare used, since low temperatures will lead to contraction of polymer molecules, thus widening the pores in the material (in the atomic scales). This will enhance the diffusion of gases, leading to spurious results.\n\u2022 Mixing of arterial and venous blood should be avoided since the \nreference intervals for parameters (especially pO\n2) are different for \narterial and venous samples.\nC. Instrumentation\nABG analyses are performed by automated analyzers nowadays. The analytes that are estimated include pH, pO\n2 and pCO 2. The estima-\ntion of these analytes is done with the help of electrochemical sensors and employs ion-selective electrodes and the principles of potentiom-etry and amperometry. The HCO\n3\u2212 concentration is calculated once the \npH and pCO 2 values are obtained, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch \nequation.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   43 24-10-2020   12:07:25"

INTERPRETATION OF AN ABG ANALYSIS REPORT\nInterpretation of an ABG analysis report involves addressing the following questions:\nIs there acidosis or alkalosis present?\nLook at the pH. pH <7.35 denotes acidosis and pH >7.45 denotes alkalosis. It should be noted that acidosis or alkalosis may be present \neven if the pH is within the reference interval; this happens in cases where body mechanisms compensate for acidosis or alkalos is, and \nin mixed acid-base disorders.\nIs the acid-base disturbance metabolic or respiratory?\nIn primary respiratory disorders, the pH and pCO2 change in opposite directions. In primary metabolic disorders the pH and pCO2 change \nin the same direction (see Table 3 given in the appendix of this Unit, p. 72)\nIs there appropriate compensation?\nRespiratory disorders are compensated by metabolic responses and vice versa. Compensatory mechanisms return the pH towards, but  \nnot always to, the normal value. However, in chronic respiratory alkalosis, pH may even reach the normal value due to compensat ion. \nSee Table 4 given in the appendix of this Unit for a summary of the expected compensation in various acid-base disorders, p. 72 .\nIt should be noted that no disorder of acid-base balance is over-compensated. Inappropriate (inadequate or excessive) compensat ory \nresponses should lead to a suspicion of a mixed acid-base disorder.\nWhat is the plasma anion gap?\nPlasma anion gap should be calculated when metabolic acidosis is present, using the formula [Na+]\u2013([Cl\u2212] + [HCO3\u2212]), all values in mmol/l. \nNarrow down the causes based on high or non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. In case of high anion gap, it is also important to lo ok at the \nosmolal gap (See Chapter 5, VIII. Medical Perspectives, p. 65), if available to calculate. High anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolal gap suggests poisoning with methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol.\nDoes the report correlate clinically?\nFinally, ABG reports should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical history and examination findings and should co rrelate with \nthe underlying cause of acid base imbalance. If there is no clinical correlation, a repeat sampling and report should be obtain ed; other \nunderlying causes should be considered.If the values do not corroborate, the ABG report is not valid. This could arise due to an instrument error, or some laxity duri ng the sample \ncollection or transport.Is the ABG report valid?\nThe consistency of the ABG report is assessed with the help of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,\npH = 6.1 + log                        which, on rearranging gives:\n[0.03 \u00d7 pCO\n2][HCO3 ]\n[H+] in nanomoles/l = 24(pCO2)/[HCO3 ]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   44 24-10-2020   12:07:25"

Medical Perspectives\nThis section describes some additional medical perspectives in relation to the topics described in the previous sections. \nMost of the common conditions are already given in the text.\n\u2022 ABG analysis is one of the most commonly done investigation in intensive care units. It is used to document respiratory \nfailure and assess its severity, monitor patients on ventilators, assess acid-base balance in critical illness and assess response to therapeutic interventions like mechanical ventilation.\n\u2022 Acute mountain sickness (AMS) develops in certain individuals at altitudes above 3,000\u20134,000 m; hypoxia leads to \nincreased cerebral blood flow and increased fluid extravasation from the blood vessels into interstitial space leading to cerebral edema (known as high-altitude cerebral edema or HACE). The condition is potentially fatal, unless promptly managed immediately. Definite management is a rapid descent to lower attitudes. Pharmacological management for treatment and prevention of AMS involves administration of acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase , which \nleads to impaired HCO\n3\u2212 excretion and metabolic acidosis. Respiratory compensation by increased rate and depth \nof ventilation improves oxygenation to the brain. This, along with the diuretic action of acetazolamide relieves edema and the manifestations of AMS.\n\u2022 Acidosis leads to hyperkalemia\u2014what is the underlying mechanism? Na\n+-H+ exchanger transports Na+ into the cells \nin exchange of H+ transport into ECF. In acidosis, the H+ concentration of ECF is already high, so the activity of this \nexchanger is diminished. Less intracellular sodium levels, which results, inhibit Na+-K+ ATPase , and thus retention of \nK+ in the ECF (see Fig. 5.14, p. 63). The opposite happens in alkalosis, leading to hypokalemia.\n\u2022 Mutations in an isoenzyme of carbonic anhydrase , CA-2 lead to impairment of acidification of bone by osteoclasts, \na process which is important in bone resorption. This leads to formation of hard and dense bones\u2014the condition is termed osteopetrosis ( osteo\u2014bone, petra\u2014rock ).\nVIII. Chapter Summary\npH of various body fluids has to be maintained within a narrow range, so as to ensure the proper functioning of various \nbody processes. The pH is maintained within this range with the help of diverse mechanisms that act in a coordinated manner to resist the aberrations and revert any changes occurring to the pH. \nBuffers act quickly but only for short term. The main physiological buffers in the body are bicarbonate buffer, phosphate \nbuffer and protein (and hemoglobin) buffers. In the ECF, bicarbonate buffer plays a prime role. Phosphate buffer is impor-tant in intracellular fluid and urine. Buffering action of proteins is mostly due to the histidine residues, as their pK\na value \nis close to the physiological pH. In RBCs, hemoglobin contributes to an additional mechanism in buffering.\nLungs maintain the pH by regulating the levels of CO 2. Buildup of H+ and CO 2 results in increased rate and depth of venti-\nlation, and vice versa, thus regulating the CO 2 elimination and retention, respectively, regulating the pH.\nExcretion of non-volatile acid is the function of kidneys. Renal regulation of pH is slow acting\u2014but sustained and compre-\nhensive. Kidneys reabsorb bicarbonate; kidneys also excrete H+ directly and also in the form of ammonium ion and in \ncombination with phosphates. Kidneys also generate bicarbonate, to replenish base stores in the body.\nThe physiological pH of arterial blood is 7.35\u20137.45; a decrease is termed acidemia and an increase is termed alkalemia. \nRespiratory causes of acid-base disturbances include primary alterations in the pCO 2; compensation is by renal mecha-\nnisms and involves HCO 3\u2212 conservation or elimination as the case may be. Metabolic causes of acid-base disturbances \ninclude primary alterations in the HCO 3\u2212; compensation is by respiratory mechanisms and involves CO 2 conservation or \nelimination, depending on the underlying abnormality. Simple acid-base disorders never result in overcompensation; if overcompensation or long-term undercompensation is observed, mixed acid-base disorder is to be suspected, where there is more than one primary abnormality. \nRespiratory acidosis is caused by CO\n2 retention due to depression of respiratory center, respiratory muscle fatigue or \nparalysis, diseases of airways and lungs, or conditions that restrict ventilation. Respiratory alkalosis results from CO 2 \nwashout and occurs due to overvigorous mechanical ventilation or due to stimulation of respiratory center.\nMetabolic acidosis stems from HCO 3\u2212 elimination and can be classified based on the anion gap into non-anion gap \nmetabolic acidosis and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. The former is associated with hyperchloremia. Renal tubular acidosis, an example of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, occurs due to failure in acidification of urine due to impaired excretion of H\n+ or reabsorption of HCO 3\u2212.

Both pH and pCO 2 are \ndecreased (hence the change in pH and pCO 2 are in the \nsame direction), suggesting metabolic acidosis.4.1. A 2-year-old boy was brought to the neurology \nOPD with complaints of progressive muscle weak-ness and delay in achieving developmental mile-stones. The child was born at full term and was normal at birth but started developing seizures at the age of 3 months. The child was unable to control his head, sit, or grasp objects.\n Investigations showed blood pH of 7.24, pCO\n2 \n38 mm of Hg, HCO 3\u2212 16 mmol/L, plasma chlo-\nride 95 mmol/l, plasma sodium 138 mmol/l, and elevated levels of serum lactate. Muscle biopsy and estimation of  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) \ncomplex activity revealed a decreased activity of the PDH enzyme complex.\nA. What is the acid-base disturbance in this \npatient?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Since this is a case of metabolic acidosis, the \nsuggested compensation is respiratory, i.e., a reduction in the pCO\n2. pCO 2 is expected to decrease by 1.25 mm of \nHg per 1 mmol/l reduction in HCO 3\u2212. \n Here, reduction in HCO 3\u2212 = 24 \u2212 16 = 8 mmol/l.\n Therefore, expected reduction in pCO 2 = 8 x 1.25 = 10 \nmm of Hg.\n But observed reduction in HCO 3\u2212 = 40 \u2212 38 = 2 mm \nof Hg.\n Thus, this is a case of uncompensated metabolic \nacidosis.B. What is the expected compensation?\nAnswer\u2014C:  Since this is a case of metabolic acidosis, \nplasma anion gap has to be calculated.\n Plasma anion gap = 138 \u2212 (95 + 16) = 27 mmol/l (which \nis elevated). Thus, this is a case of high anion gap meta-bolic acidosis.\n Defect in PDH leads to decreased conversion of pyru-\nvate produced by glucose metabolism into acetyl CoA. The pyruvate that accumulates is channeled into lactate (+ H\n+) by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Elevated \nlactate (+ H+, which is secreted into the ECF) is the reason \nfor the high anion gap metabolic acidosis.C. What is the reason for the observed acid-base \ndisturbance in this patient?\nAnswer\u2014D:  Nervous tissue requires a lot of ATP for the \nnormal functions like neurotransmitter synthesis, nerve conduction, and maintenance of osmotic balance in the cell via Na\n+-K+ ATPase. Nervous tissue depends on \nglucose metabolism for most of its energy requirements. Defective conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA causes a drastic reduction in the number of ATP molecules that can be generated from glucose\u2014this leads to nerve dysfunc-tion and neurological manifestations.D.

Both pH is increased \nand pCO 2 is decreased (hence the change in pH and \npCO 2 are in the opposite direction), suggesting respira-\ntory alkalosis.4.2. A 19-year-old male medical student was brought \nto the emergency by his friends with complaints of tingling and numbness of face and spasm of extremities for the past 30 minutes. On physical examination, he looked apprehensive. His respi-ratory rate was 26/min (normal: 12\u201316/min). Since his symptoms was consistent with hypocalcemia, investigations were ordered. The level of free calcium in the serum was 1.05 mmol/l (reference: 1.12\u20131.32 mmol/l). An arterial blood gas analysis gave the following results\u2014blood pH, 7.51; pCO\n2, \n28 mm of Hg; HCO 3\u2212, 22 mmol/l. \n On further questioning, it was revealed that the \npatient was supposed to give a Biochemistry theory examination on acid-base balance the next day, for which he had hardly prepared.\nA. What is the acid-base abnormality in this case?Answer\u2014B:  Alkalosis increases the binding of free Ca2+ \nin the circulation to albumin, leading on to sudden reduc-tion in the levels of free Ca\n2+ and clinical features of hypo-\ncalcemia like tingling, numbness and muscle spasms (or tetany).\nB. What is the reason for hypocalcemia in this \npatient?Answer\u2014C:  Since this seems to be a case of hyperven-\ntilation due to anxiety, the patient is to be given reassur-ance. He can be asked to rebreathe into a bag, and this means the inspired air will have more CO\n2 which helps in \ncompensation of alkalosis.\nC. How will you treat this patient?\nMultiple-Choice Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nCorrect answer = C.  High anion gap metabolic acidosis \nwith increased osmolal gap. Addition of ethylene glycol to the blood leads to an increase in the anions in plasma, which is not measured routinely. This leads to an increase in the anion gap. Ethylene glycol also increases the osmo-lality of the plasma, and causes a higher level of freezing point depression, compared to normal plasma, thus increasing the plasma osmolality. This leads to an increase in the osmolal gap (see Chapter 5, Section VIII. Medical Perspectives. p. 65).4.1.

Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal \nosmolal gap\nC. High anion gap metabolic acidosis with \nincreased osmolal gap\nD. High anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal \nosmolal gap\nCorrect answer = D.  Acute diarrheal disease. Decreased \nblood pH with decrease in bicarbonate suggests meta-bolic acidosis. Adrenal hyperplasia leads to hyperaldo-steronism and metabolic alkalosis, hence not the correct answer. Acute renal failure, type B lactic acidosis and acute diarrheal disease\u2014all the three lead to metabolic acidosis, so we have to look at the anion gap. Here anion gap = 140 \u2212 (112 + 20) = 8 mmol/l, which is normal. Among the options, only acute diarrheal disease leads to non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.4.2.

OVERVIEW\nWater is considered to be the universal solvent and acts as the medium \nfor a large number of biochemical reactions that sustain life. Water gives a major contribution to the body weight in humans. Indeed, the human body can be considered as an organized solution of proteins, minerals, and fat in water! In multicellular organisms, water is present in distinct body compart-ments\u2014the distribution and movement of water across these compart-ments are finely regulated. Numerous disease states lead to or result in aberrations of normal water distribution. \nClosely associated with the distribution of body water is the concentra-\ntion of electrolytes in various body compartments. Important electrolytes of the body include Na\n+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl\u2212 and HCO 3\u2212. Electrolytes serve \ndiverse functions in the body, e.g., they maintain resting membrane poten-tial, facilitate neurotransmission and muscle contraction, regulate myocar-dial electrical activity, and are involved in signal transduction. A number of mechanisms regulate the electrolyte and water distribution in the body, and not surprisingly, electrolyte imbalance is seen in several pathological condi-tions. A significant number of patients in most in-patient hospital settings have some form of electrolyte abnormality, and when left unaddressed is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.\nThis chapter describes the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance \nin the body. The discussion on electrolytes will be limited to sodium and potassium. Various causes and consequences of electrolyte abnormalities are also mentioned, along with the estimation of sodium and potassium in the laboratory.\nII.

The rest of the body weight is contributed mostly by proteins, minerals, and fats\u2014approx-imately 18%, 7%, and 15%, respectively, in adult males.\nA. Body fluid compartments\nA 70-kg normal adult male will have 42 L of total body water (consid-ering that 60% of the body weight is due to water, and the density water is 1 kg/L). This water is distributed between intracellular and extracel-lular compartments (\nFig. 5.1 ). The major components of extracellular \nfluid (ECF) are interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma. ISF is the fluid that is present in between the cells and constitutes nearly three-fourths of the ECF volume, i.e., 10.5 L; it is also known as tissue fluid. Plasma is the acellular component of the blood and comprises 3.5 L of the total 5 L volume of blood. Other minor components the ECF include lymph, and transcellular fluids\u2014fluids present within linings of epithelial cavities (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, intraocular fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pericardial fluid).\nThe different fluid compartments vary in their electrolyte and protein \ncontent (\nFig. 5.2 ). Sodium is the major extracellular cation, and potas-\nsium is the major intracellular cation. The composition of plasma and ISF are nearly identical, with respect to cations. Since ISF is formed by the filtration of plasma at capillary level, the protein content of ISF is less than that of the plasma (since proteins have a higher molecular weight and a lot of them hence resist filtration). To maintain the charge neutrality, there is increased level of small anions like chloride and bicarbonate in ISF , in lieu of the negatively charged proteins.Intracellular\nfluid\n28 L66%Extra-\ncellular\nfluid\n14 L34%Interstitial\nfluid\n10.5 L\nPlasma\n3.5 L\nTotal body water (42 L)75%\n25%\nFigure 5.1\nBody fluid compartments (the volumes \nshown are for a 70-kg normal male).\n K+\n Na+\nOthers\nChlorideBicarbonateProteinsPhosphates K+\n Na+OthersOthers\nBicarbonate\nChloride K+\nProteinsOthers Others\nBicarbonate\n Na+\nChlorideIntracellular fluid Interstitial fluid Plasma\nPlasma membrane, which is semipermeable, \nallows selective transport of moleculesCapillary endothelium and inter-endothelial \nfenestrations allow free movement of small ions and molecules\nFigure 5.2\nComposition of various body fluid compartments.

Water intake and removal\nThe total water volume in the body is determined by the addition of \nwater to the body and its removal from it (see Table 5, appendix Unit V, p. 72). Daily intake of water through ingestion of fluids directly and as part of food amounts to 2,100 ml. Water added by the metabolic reac-tions that result in water generation\u2014the so-called \u201cmetabolic water,\u201d accounts for an additional 200 ml. Thus, nearly 2,300 ml of water is added to the total body water per day.\nThe same volume of water gets removed daily from the body, main-\ntaining the total water volume in the body relatively constant. Most of the water removal happens through excretion via the kidneys, resulting in a urine output of 1,400 ml/day or 1 ml/minute. Water is also lost from the skin and the respiratory tract as a result of evaporation. This \u201cinsen-sible water loss\u201d removes 700 ml of water from the body every day. An additional 200 ml of water is lost through feces\u2014the total daily water loss adding up to 2,300 ml.\nThis steady state in water balance is altered in physiological and patho-\nlogical conditions. For instance, exertion, sweating, fever, and hyperven-tilation\u2014all these lead to an enhanced \u201cinsensible water loss\u201d through skin or respiratory tract or both. Diarrhea results in an increased water loss through feces. All these have to be compensated by an increase in the fluid intake and by the conservation of water by the kidneys. What acts as the signal for the body to deploy these mechanisms? The answer lies in certain receptors in the hypothalamus.\nC. Water balance is closely knit with osmolality of the ECF\nOsmolality refers to the osmoles (or the number of osmotically active particles) per kilogram of a solvent, in the case of human body, water. Osmolality of plasma (which, for all the practical purposes, is equated with the osmolality of ECF) is determined by the cations, anions and other osmoles that are abundant in the plasma. Plasma osmolality is calculated by the formula:\nPlasma osmolality = 2Na\n+ + Glucose + Urea\nwhere, the plasma concentrations of sodium, glucose and urea are \nexpressed in mmol/l and the plasma osmolality is expressed in millios-moles/kg (mOsmol/kg) . Note the following:\n\u2022 Osmolarity refers to the number of osmoles per liter of a solvent. Since \n1 L of water weighs ~1 kg at body temperature, in biological systems, \nthe terms osmolality and osmolarity are used interchangeably. \n\u2022 In the formula, sodium concentration is multiplied by a factor of 2 \nto account for the anions that are associated with sodium (primarily, chloride and bicarbonate), instead of adding them separately to the equation, since these are also osmotically active.\n\u2022 Urea and glucose are the other major osmoles. Proteins are not \nincluded in the formula despite their high concentration in the plasma (up to 8 g/dl), as the absolute number of protein molecules are negli-gible (in comparison to the other osmoles) due to the higher molec-ular weight of proteins. \n\u2022 Reference interval for plasma osmolality is 275\u2013295 mOsmol/kg.\nConditions associated with an excess loss of water relative to sodium, \nfrom the ECF (e.g., sweating or exercise), is accompanied by an increase in the plasma osmolality. Hypothalamus contains certain special neurons with specific receptors that are known as osmore-ceptors.

One \neffect of this signaling is the release of a peptide hormone vasopressin from the stored vesicles of the posterior pituitary (\nFig. 5.3 ). Vasopressin \nbrings about an increased water reabsorption from the renal collecting ducts as explained in the subheading D. Vasopressin causes solute-\nfree water reabsorption by the nephrons. Osmoreceptor activation also leads to activation of thirst, so as to induce fluid intake, and restoration of the osmolality to the normal.\nApart from the alterations in the plasma osmolality, a reduction in the \nblood volume and blood pressure also acts as a stimulus for osmo-receptor activation. This is seen in conditions like diarrhea and blood loss. Hypervolemia (increase in the volume of ECF) and reductions in the plasma osmolality lead to diminished osmoreceptor signaling, reduced vasopressin in circulation, and suppression of thirst.\nD. Vasopressin causes solute-free water reabsorption by \nthe nephrons\nVasopressin ( vaso: vessel, press : pressure), also known as antidiuretic \nhormone or ADH ( anti: against, diuresis : increased urination), is a nine \namino-acid peptide (nonapeptide) hormone. In humans, the 8th amino acid is arginine, so the hormone is also called arginine vasopressin or AVP (\nFig. 5.4 ). Vasopressin is produced by the supraoptic and para-\nventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. It is then transported along the pituitary stalk by nerve fibers to the posterior pituitary for storage in vesicles, from where it is released on osmoreceptor stimulation. \nAVP mediates its action principally through two receptors\u2014V\n1 recep-\ntors, localized to the vascular smooth muscles when engaged by AVP , lead to contraction of the vascular smooth muscles, vasoconstriction, Figure 5.3\nVasopressin/arginine vasopressin (AVP)/antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is synthesized by hypothalamic nuclei and is stored and secreted from posterior pituitary, in response to a number of stimuli.\n\u2191Body water\nPosterior pituitary Anterior pituitary\u2191AVP secretionOsmoreceptors\nHypothalamusOsmoreceptor activation\u2191Plasma \nosmolality\n\u2193ECF volume\n\u2191Thirst+\n++\n\u2013\nParaventricular nucleusSupraoptic nucleus\nHormone secreting \ncells\nPro\nArg\nGlyPhe\nTyr\nCys\n1234\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9S \u2013 SGlu\nAsn\nCys\nFigure 5.4\nStructure of arginine vasopressin (AVP) \n\u2013 Note that the 8th amino acid in this nonapeptide is arginine.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   53 24-10-2020   12:07:26"

V 2 receptors, present in nephrons in \nthe thick ascending limb of loop of Henle and the principal cells of the collecting duct, play a direct role in water homeostasis. Binding of AVP to V\n2 receptors leads to insertion of the cytoplasmic aquaporins into \nthe apical membrane of the cells ( Fig. 5.5 ). The thick ascending limb of \nloop of Henle and the principal cells of the collecting duct are other-wise totally impermeable to water, and the transport of water across the apical membranes of these cells is entirely dependent on this inser-tion of aquaporin-2. At the basolateral surface, other aquaporins trans-port water into the interstitium, and then into the circulation (\nFig. 5.5 ). \nV2 receptor signaling also causes increased transcription of aquaporin \ngene. The overall effect is a reduction in the osmolality of the ECF , and an increase in the ECF volume.\nAn impairment in AVP production or function leads to impaired water \nreabsorption by the kidneys, resulting in increased urine volume (poly-uria), decreased urine osmolality, hypernatremia, i.e., increased plasma concentration of sodium (as water is removed from the body, but sodium remains the same), increased plasma osmolality and increased thirst (polydipsia). The condition is known as diabetes insipidus , and \nbased on the etiology is classified into central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In the former, the production of AVP is impaired due to destruction of the hypothalamic cells due to autoimmu-nity, tumors or trauma, or due to mutations in the gene coding for AVP . Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus commonly occurs due to mutations in the genes encoding V\n2 receptor or aquaporin-2.\nA converse is seen in SIADH\u2014the Syndrome of  Inappropriate secre-\ntion of AntiDiuretic Hormone , which is seen in disorders of central \nnervous system like stroke, infections, and trauma, and also in tumors (like certain lung cancers) that ectopically produce AVP .

Blood volume is also determined by the plasma proteins\nThe functions of the ISF or tissue fluid include providing nutrition to \nthe tissues, facilitating gaseous exchange to and from the tissues, and removal of waste from the tissues. To carry out these functions, ISF is in constant exchange with the fluid portion of the blood, i.e., the plasma, and this exchange occurs at the level of capillaries. However, since the diameter of the intercellular fenestrations is <7 nm, blood cells and larger molecules (e.g., most of the plasma proteins) cannot enter the ISF .\nThe filtration of fluid across the capillary membrane is determined by \na balance of forces known as Starling forces (\nFig. 5.6 ). The force that \nfavors the fluid entry into the interstitial space is the hydrostatic pres-sure gradient (which is the difference between the hydrostatic pressures of the capillary and the ISF , the former being higher). The osmotic pres-sure difference between the plasma and the ISF also determines the fluid movement. The small molecules and ions are distributed equally between plasma and ISF\u2014so the effective osmoles in this case are the molecules that do not diffuse\u2014the plasma proteins. The osmotic pres-sure contributed by the plasma proteins is known as oncotic pressure or colloid osmotic pressure, and this is thus important in the retention of fluid in the intravascular compartment and also in the resorption of fluids from ISF into the circulation. \nOverall, the hydrostatic pressure gradient is slightly higher than the \nopposing oncotic pressure gradient, resulting in some retention of fluid within the ISF . This is then returned to the intravascular compartment via lymphatics. Accumulation of ISF in excess amounts is known as edema. This is seen when there is obstruction of lymphatics, the vessels that carry lymph. Edema also results when levels of albumin, the major plasma protein is low (hypoalbuminemia)\u2014a reduction in the colloid osmotic pressure (or oncotic pressure) that sets in, leading to edema.\nIII. REGULATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM\nThe regulation of electrolytes of the ECF, especially sodium, is closely associated with the water balance, as seen in Section IIC. Water balance is closely knit with osmolality of the ECF (see p. 52), and is determined by AVP in response to plasma osmolality. Multiple other factors also deter-mine the concentration of the important electrolytes in the body fluids. In this section, the additional mechanisms that keep the levels of these elec-trolytes within the physiological limits are described.\nA. Sodium-Potassium ATPase (Na+-K+ ATPase) pump\nThe interior of the cells contains many negatively charged molecules like proteins and organic phosphates in higher amounts (\nFig. 5.2 ). The \nplasma membrane is impermeable to these molecules. The presence of these molecules tends to attract positive ions from the ECF into the cells. Entry of these ions, predominantly sodium, which is the principal cation of the ECF , increases the intracellular osmolality. This unchecked presence of sodium within the cell will lead to osmosis of water into the cell, leading to cell swelling and lysis. This is abated by the sodium-potassium ATPase  pump (\nFig. 5.7 ). For each molecule of ATP hydro-\nlyzed, 3 Na+ are extruded from the cell, while 2 K+ are transported \ninside. Because of the imbalance in the number of Na+ and K+ ions \ntransported by the Na+-K+ ATPase , this protein acts as an electrogenic Blood flow\n33 mm 28 mm\n0 mm 8 mm 0 mmInterstitial space\nCells8 mm13 mm 28 mm\nNet:\n13 mmNet:\n7 mmArterial end of\nthe capillaryVenous end of\nthe capillary\nFigure 5.6\nStarling forces that mediate fluid \nexchange between plasma and interstitial fluid at the capillaries. The hydrostatic pressure is shown in dark red, and oncotic pressure is shown in blue. All pressures are given in mm of Hg. There is a net pressure difference of 13 \u2212 7 = 6 mm Hg between the arterial and the venous ends of the capillaries. The net filtration due to this pressure is compensated by a larger number of venous capillaries than arterial capillaries. Some fluid that is retained is returned to the circulation via lymph.\nOsmolality versus Tonicity\nIn biological systems, since \ncertain ions can freely diffuse across the semipermeable membrane to reach an equi-librium, such ions will not contribute to the osmotic pressure, even though they will be included in the calcu-lation of osmolality. Hence, a distinct term is required to express the effect of osmoti-cally active molecules that are effective in bringing about a change in the osmotic pres-sure. Tonicity is the concen-tration of effective osmoles in a solution. Water thus moves into a hypertonic solution from a hypotonic solution, when separated by a semiperme-able membrane.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   55 24-10-2020   12:07:27"

Since more ions leave the cell due to the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase , \nwater also moves out of the cell and prevents cell lysis. Indeed, in a resting individual, a major chunk of the total ATP consumption by the body is for the functioning of the Na\n+-K+ ATPases . Another implication \nof the activity of the Na+-K+ ATPase  is the higher levels of potassium \nwithin the cell and sodium outside the cell, making these ions the prin-cipal cations of intracellular and extracellular fluids, respectively.\nNa\n+-K+ ATPase  is also involved in secondary active transport of mole-\ncules like glucose and amino acids in the intestines and the nephrons (see Chapter 12, Section III D. Intestinal absorption of monosaccha-rides, p. 180 and Chapter 24, Section III D. Amino acid and small peptide intestinal absorption, p. 381, and Fig. 12.10 and see \nFig. 5.17 ). \nB. Renal handling of sodium and potassium\nElectrolytes can be lost via multiple body secretions like sweat, mucosal secretions, and gastrointestinal fluids, but kidneys are the only organs that have the ability to conserve or excrete electrolytes under a tight regulatory control. Glomeruli freely filter Na\n+ and K+ into the renal \ntubules. More than 99% of the sodium and 87% of potassium that is filtered by the glomeruli are reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This reab-sorption occurs at multiple sites in the nephrons, and is mediated by numerous transporters, and is under the influence of various regulatory factors (see \nFig. 5.18 ). \nIn the proximal tubule, sodium is reabsorbed by the tubular epithe-\nlial cells from the lumen by at least three mechanisms\u2014cotransport with glucose (via Sodium- GLucose Co Transporter- 2, SGLT2), cotrans-\nport with amino acids, and in exchange for H\n+ (by a Na+-H+ exchanger). \nAn active transport mechanism that relies on the ATP hydrolysis by the Na\n+-K+ ATPase  located on the basolateral membrane of the tubular \nepithelial cells, leads to pumping of sodium into the interstitium. Potassium which enters the cell is transported into the tubular fluid. In the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, sodium is reabsorbed by two different transporters\u2014Na\n+-K+-2Cl\u2212 cotransporter and Na+-H+ \nexchanger. A Na+-Cl\u2212 cotransporter in the distal tubule and epithelial \nsodium channels (ENaCs) in the principal cells of the collecting duct, further completes the sodium reabsorption.\nMost of the K\n+ reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule predomi-\nnantly by a paracellular route. This paracellular transport is mediated by a chemical gradient generated by reabsorption of Na\n+ and an electrical \ngradient generated by Cl\u2212 reabsorption. Paracellular transport also \noccurs in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, along with transcel-lular transport of K\n+ via the Na+-K+-2Cl\u2212 cotransporter. Together, these \naccount for reabsorption of about 87% of filtered K+. In the intercalated \ncells of collecting duct, K+ reabsorption is mediated by a K+-H+ ATPase \nin the apical surface and K+ channels on the basolateral membrane. \nPotassium is also secreted by the principal cells of the collecting duct by a renal outer medullary K\n+ channel (ROMK).\nC.

The other stimulus for renin secretion is a low blood pressure in the afferent arteriole, which reflects a low ECF volume. \nRenin cleaves a protein angiotensinogen which is synthesized by the \nliver and released into the plasma. The cleavage releases a deca-peptide, angiotensin-I, from the amino terminal of angiotensinogen. Angiotensin-I undergoes further cleavage into an octapeptide, angio-tensin-II. This second cleavage is catalyzed by a peptidase that is present mostly in the pulmonary capillaries, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (\nFig. 5.8 ). \nAngiotensin-II binds to AT1 receptors, which are G-protein coupled \nreceptors (GPCRs) on the plasma membrane. Downstream signaling of these receptors lead to an increase in the intracellular calcium levels. AT1 receptors are localized mainly to two sites in the body.

Water and Electrolyte Balance of Body Fluids\nAldosterone is a steroid hormone; it acts by binding to a mineralocor-\nticoid receptor in the cytoplasm of the principal cells of the collecting duct. The hormone-receptor complex then translocates to the nucleus and increases the transcription of the ENaCs (\nFig. 5.8 ). Aldosterone \nalso promotes the insertion of ENaCs into the apical membrane of these cells, in addition to increasing the activity of the Na\n+-K+ ATPase  \non the basolateral surface. The effect is increased reabsorption of Na+, \nand secretion of K+. To summarize, in response to a low ECF sodium, \nor a low vascular volume, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \n(RAAS) promotes sodium (and hence water) retention and potassium \nexcretion.\nIn conditions that lead to hypervolemia, an increase in the ECF volume \nleads to stretching of the walls of atria and ventricles, in response to which two hormones are released from these structures\u2014atrial natri-uretic peptide (ANP; natrium : sodium  uresis: excretion in urine) and \nB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP , previously known by a misnomer\u2014brain natriuretic peptide). Their actions are similar and is mediated by cGMP signaling (see Chapter 18, Section IV.E.2. Nitric oxide and vascular endothelium, p. 256). The natriuretic peptides inhibit the secre-tion of renin and reduce the sensitivity of zona glomerulosa to angio-tensin-II\u2014they eventually cause sodium and water excretion (natriuresis and diuresis).\nIV. FUNCTIONS OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM\nNa+ is the principal cation of the ECF and is the prime determinant of \nthe ECF volume and water balance. Normal level of sodium in the ECF is required to prevent shifting of water to or from the intracellular compart-ment. Sodium thus prevents cell lysis and cell shrinkage, by maintaining the water level in the intracellular compartment. Sodium also maintains the intravascular volume and thus the integrity of circulation to the periph-eral organs. \nSecondary active transport facilitated by the Na\n+-K+ ATPase  is essential \nfor a large number of molecules like monosaccharides and amino acids for their absorption from intestines and the reabsorption from the renal tubules. Exchange of Na\n+ and K+ with H+ in the renal tubules is also impor-\ntant in maintaining the pH of the ECF.\nDifferential distribution of Na+ and K+ by the Na+-K+ ATPase  is the reason \nfor the generation of the membrane potential. In excitable tissues like nerves and muscles, movement of these ions across the membranes leads to depolarization, and generation of action potential\u2014this is important in nerve conduction and muscle contraction. Thus, perturbations in the levels of Na\n+ and K+ can lead to dysfunction of these tissues and life-threatening \nclinical manifestations.\nV. SODIUM DISORDERS\nReference limits for plasma Na+ concentration is 136\u2013145 mmol/l. A plasma \nconcentration less than 136 mmol/l is referred to as hyponatremia; when the concentration is more than 145 mmol/l, the term used is hyperna-tremia. The effects of hypernatremia and hyponatremia on a cell are shown in \nFigure 5.9 . These effects are most pronounced in the nervous tissue.\nHyponatremia leads to cerebral edema, leading onto neurological manifes-\ntations like headache, nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases, seizure, Normal HyponatremiaH2O\nH2O H2O\nHypernatremiaH2OH2O\nFigure 5.9\nEffects of hypernatremia and \nhyponatremia on the cells.

Hypernatremia leads to shrinkage of brain cells\u2014sudden shrinkages can be accompanied by brain hemorrhages and hematomas. Most frequent clinical manifestation is an altered mental status. In acute severe cases, coma and death ensue.\nSince water balance is closely associated with Na\n+ levels, both hypona-\ntremia and hypernatremia should always be addressed in context to the regulation of water in the body.\nA. Causes of hyponatremia\nHyponatremia develops when there is a relative reduction of body Na+, \nwith respect to the total body water. This can happen in three broad scenarios\u2014these situations are classified based on the volume status of the ECF (\nFig. 5.10 ).\n 1. Hypovolemic hyponatremia:  Here both Na+ and water are lost \nfrom the body. Fluid loss leads to stimulation of AVP release and increased solute-free water reabsorption by kidneys. Hence, the loss of Na\n+ exceeds that of water\u2014the resultant effect is hypona-\ntremia. This condition is also termed as \u201cdepletional hyponatremia.\u201d The loss of Na\n+ and water can be renal or extrarenal. \n a. Renal causes include:\ni.  Diuretics promote renal excretion of Na+ and water and \nreduce the ECF volume. This is achieved by most of these drugs by inhibiting renal reabsorption of Na\n+.\nDiuretics\nPrimary adrenal insufficiencyMetabolic alkalosisDiabetic ketoacidosis\nCongestive Heart Failure\nNephrotic syndromeCirrhosisExtrarenal losses Renal losses\nAcute Kidney Disease\nChronic Kidney DiseaseSIADH\nSecondary adrenal deficiencyPrimary polydipsia\nVomiting* / Diarrhea*\nExcess sweating*/Fever*Trauma*Pancreatitis**when hypotonic fluids \nare administeredHypovolemia\n\u2022 Total body water \u2193\n\u2022 Total body sodium \u2193\u2193Euvolemia\n\u2022 Total body water \u2191\n\u2022 Total body sodium \u2194Hypervolemia\n\u2022 Total body water \u2191\u2191\n\u2022 Total body sodium \u2191Volume StatusHyponatremia\nFigure 5.10\nClassification and causes of hyponatremia.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   59 24-10-2020   12:07:29"

Addison\u2019s disease is characterized by reduced mineralocor-\nticoid (and glucocorticoid) synthesis due to dysfunction of adrenal and impairment of Na\n+ reabsorption in the collecting \nduct.\niii.   In metabolic alkalosis (see Chapter 4, Section IV.B. \nMetabolic alkalosis, p. 42), the body tries to conserve H+, by \npromoting H+ reabsorption via Na+-H+ exchangers resulting \nin increased sodium losses.\niv.   In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (see Chapter 21, V.C. \nExcessive ketone body production in diabetes mellitus, p. 314) and starvation ketoacidosis, Na\n+ gets excreted \nalong with \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate in the urine. In DKA, increased \nplasma glucose levels also draw water from the intracellular compartment, leading to hyponatremia.\n b.   Extrarenal causes include the following conditions, when \nassociated with replacement of fluids that do not contain sufficient Na\n+:\ni.   Gastrointestinal fluid and electrolyte loss which occurs in \nvomiting and diarrhea.\nii.   Loss through skin in conditions like fever, excessive \nsweating and burns.\niii.   Loss of fluid into a third space (which is not in equilibrium \nwith intravascular compartment), which is seen in acute pancreatitis, in fractures causing internal bleeds, etc.\n   The difference between renal and extrarenal causes is also \nreflected in the urine sodium levels\u2014a concentration of >20 mmol/l suggests renal losses, whereas in extrarenal causes the body tries to conserve Na\n+ by increasing reab-\nsorption of Na+ by the renal tubules. \n   Clinically, hypovolemia or reduction in the volume of \nECF manifests as increased thirst, dry skin and mucous membranes, diminished peripheral pulses, hypotension, tachycardia (due to baroreceptor reflex in response to hypo-tension), and loss of skin turgor.\n 2. Euvolemic hyponatremia:  Here, total body Na\n+ remains nearly \nsame, with an increase in the total body water resulting in \u201cdilutional hyponatremia.\u201d The accumulation of water is primarily in the intra-cellular compartment, the ECF volume remaining constant\u2014hence the euvolemia. \n    Increase in the total body water occurs due to two mechanisms:\n a. Increase in solute-free water absorption due to increase in \nAVP levels:  This is classically seen in SIADH (see Section II.D \nVasopressin causes solute-free water reabsorption by  the neph-\nrons, p. 53). The other reason for elevated AVP is glucocorticoid deficiency, due to an abnormality in the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary (secondary adrenal insufficiency). Glucocorticoids have a negative feedback effect on AVP secretion, which is abrogated in secondary adrenal insufficiency.Diarrhea can be due to multiple \nmechanisms\u2014in secretory diarrhea (e.g., cholera), the bacterial toxins cause active sodium loss into the intes-tinal fluid, the fluid is isotonic to plasma; in osmotic diar-rhea (seen in administration of certain laxatives) and nontoxi-genic bacterial and viral diar-rheas, the intestinal fluid is hypotonic to plasma. Vomitus and sweat are also hypotonic to plasma. Thus, vomiting, excess sweating, osmotic diarrhea, and diarrhea due to nontoxigenic strains are asso-ciated with loss of more water than Na\n+, and thus hyperna-\ntremia. When these conditions are corrected by water alone, or hypotonic fluids, hypona-tremia can set in.\nPrimary adrenal insufficiency leads to hypovolemic hypo-natremia, while secondary adrenal insufficiency causes euvolemic hyponatremia. This is because aldosterone secre-tion is not regulated by ACTH (but by renin), so in secondary adrenal insufficiency, aldo-sterone levels are normal, unlike that in primary adrenal insufficiency.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   60 24-10-2020   12:07:29"

Increased water intake:  In normal individuals, intake of water \nbeyond a plasma osmolality less than 275 mOsmol/kg does not occur because of suppression of thirst. But in primary polydipsia (seen in defects of thirst center in brain, and in certain psychi-atric disorders), increased thirst and increased water intake lead to dilutional hyponatremia.\n In both the conditions, water first enters the ECF compartment, \nbut rapidly redistributes to the more hypertonic milieu within the cells, keeping the ECF volume to near normal, and total body water getting increased.\n 3. Hypervolemic hyponatremia:  Here, there is an increase in the total \nbody water and a relatively less increase in the Na\n+ levels. The ECF \nvolume is increased\u2014hence the hypervolemia. The causes include:\n a.  Acute and chronic kidney disease, where the ability of kidneys \nto concentrate the tubular fluid is impaired, leading to an imbal-ance in water and sodium removal by the kidneys. \n b.  Congestive heart failure leads to hypotension and activation \nof RAAS (\nFig. 5.11 ). Na+ and water retention occur, but since \nthe heart cannot maintain cardiac output, stasis of fluid occurs, which escapes into the interstitial space, leading to edema. \n c.  Hypoalbuminemia, seen in nephrotic syndrome and cirrhosis, \nalso leads to edema (see Section II.E Blood volume is also determined by the plasma proteins, p. 55). A decrease in blood volume, followed by activation of RAAS, increased Na\n+ and water \nretention and an inability to retain the water absorbed within the vascular compartment are seen in these conditions also.\nB.

Increased K+ in \nplasma is also seen when cell lysis occurs in the samples collected\u2014this occurs in hemolysis and in conditions that drastically increase WBCs (e.g., leukemias) or platelets (thrombocytosis) in blood; this is termed as pseudohyperkalemia. \nTwo other important determinants of K\n+ shift are the Na+-K+ ATPase  \nand Na+-H+ exchanger ( Fig. 5.14 )\u2014both are located on the plasma \nmembrane.\nAldosterone action is affected in patients receiving drugs \nlike spironolactone (which is a blocker of mineralocorticoid receptor) or amiloride (which inhibits ENaCs); these are called potassium-sparing diuretics, as they promote Na\n+ and water \nexcretion, without lowering the plasma K+ levels.\nB. Hypokalemia\nHypokalemia results from shift of K+ from ECF to ICF , or due to increased \nrenal or extrarenal excretion of K+, or due to reduced K+ intake (seen in \nstarvation) ( Fig. 5.15 ).

Causes of extracellular to intracellular K+ shift: The redistribu-\ntion of K+ between the body fluid compartments is determined by \nNa+-K+ ATPase  and Na+-H+ exchanger ( Fig. 5.14 ). Causes of an \nintracellular shift include:\n a.  Alkalosis\u2014due to increased activity of Na+-H+ exchanger to \ncompensate for the increased pH, causing increased intracel-lular Na\n+, which gets exchanged for ECF K+, by Na+-K+ ATPase .\n b.

Hyperthyroidism\u2014as thyroxine is a stimulator of Na+-K+ ATPase .\n 2. Causes of K+ loss from the body:  Loss of K+ can be renal or \nextrarenal. \n a.

Renal loss of K+ is seen in:\n\u2022 Conn\u2019s syndrome\u2014aldosterone excess leads to increased K+ \nloss from the collecting ducts.\n\u2022 Diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to shift of K+ into the ECF , \nincreased plasma K+ levels, and excretion of K+ filtered in \nexcess, which combines with the ketone bodies. \n\u2022 Diuretics (other than K+-sparing diuretics) that inhibit the \nrenal reabsorption of Na+ leads to increased Na+ levels in the \ntubular fluid. When this Na+-rich fluid reaches the collecting \nduct, the Na+ is reabsorbed by ENaCs and K+ is ultimately \nexcreted. This leads to hypokalemia (see Fig. 5.18 ).\n\u2022 A similar scenario is seen in certain inherited syndromes in \nwhich the tubular sodium transporters are defective. Bartter syndrome (defective Na\n+-K+-2Cl\u2212 cotransporter) and Gitelman \nsyndrome (defective Na+-Cl\u2212 cotransporter) lead to increased \nNa+ levels in the tubular fluid, while Liddle syndrome is asso-\nciated with overexpression of ENaCs\u2014all these lead to increased Na\n+-K+ exchange and hypokalemia (see Fig. 5.18 ).\nVII. ESTIMATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM\nIn the clinical laboratory, the widely used method for estimation of serum electrolytes employs ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) and is based on the principle of potentiometry (\nFig. 5.16 ). Potentiometry involves the \nmeasurement of voltage difference between two half cells of an electro-chemical cell.\nIon-selective membranes, depending on their composition, provide \nselective permeability to one particular ion\u2014this enables the ISEs to interact only with that ion. In case of Na\n+ electrode, the ion-selective \nmembrane is composed of glass (in a specific composition); ISE for K+ \nuses valinomycin.Extrarenal\n\u2022 Diarrhea\u2022 Excessive   sweatingRenal loss\n\u2022 Conn\u2019s   syndrome\u2022 Diabetic   ketoacidosis\u2022 Diuretics\u2022 Bartter   syndrome\u2022 Gitelman   syndrome\u2022 Liddle   syndrome\u2193 K+ intake:\n\u2022 StarvationExtra- to\nintracellular shift\u2022 Alkalosis\u2022 Insulin\u2022 \u03b2-adrenergic \n   receptor   agonists\u2022 Hyper-   thyroidismHypokalemia\nK+ loss from \nthe body\nFigure 5.15 \nClassification and causes of \nhypokalemia.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis can \npresent as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia or with normal plasma K\n+ levels, but the total \nK+ stores in the body is always \ndepleted in this condition.

            "Text": "VIII. Medical Perspectives 65\nVIII. Medical Perspectives\nVarious disorders related to electrolyte imbalance have been extensively discussed throughout this chapter. This section \ndescribes some additional medical perspectives in relation to serum electrolytes.\n\u2022 Osmolal gap : Colligative properties refer to those properties of solutions which are determined only by the number of \nsolute particles, and not by their mass or chemical nature. Thus, osmolality is one of the colligative properties, others being freezing point depression, elevation in boiling point and vapor pressure. Plasma osmolality can be calculated by the formula, plasma osmolality = 2Na\n+ + Glucose + Urea. Plasma osmolality can also be estimated directly by \nmeasuring the depression of freezing point of the plasma. Normally, this correlates with the calculated plasma osmo-lality. When osmoles other than Na\n+, glucose or urea are elevated in the plasma, the difference between the measured \nosmolality (by estimating the depression in freezing point of plasma) and the calculated osmolality [which is termed as osmolal gap] is increased. This is seen in poisoning with certain chemicals like ethylene glycol and methanol.\n\u2022 In certain clinical conditions, there is increased levels of fluids within the transcellular fluid compartments\u2014fluid accu-\nmulation within the pleural cavity is known as pleural effusion, and increased volume of peritoneal fluid is called ascites. Based on the etiology, the fluid can be a transudate or an exudate. Note that the transcellular fluids are ultra-filtrates of plasma, and the fluid exchange is in accordance with the Starling forces. Transudative pleural effusion and transudative ascites occur when the accumulation of fluid is due to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure or a reduc-tion in the oncotic pressure of plasma\u2014this is seen in ECF volume overload (e.g., heart failure) or in conditions leading to hypoalbuminemia. Transudates thus have a low protein content and a low cell number. On the contrary, exudative pleural effusion and exudative ascites result from an increase in the capillary permeability as a result of inflammation\u2014this is mostly seen in infections and inflammatory disorders. As the capillary permeability is high, cells and proteins are present in increased amounts in exudates. \n\u2022 The sodium-dependent transport of glucose in the proximal tubules of the kidneys is mediated by a transporter known \nas Sodium GLucose Co Transporter- 2 (SGLT2). This cotransporter is present on the apical surface of the tubular \nepithelial cells. Sodium which enters the cell along with glucose is transported into the interstitium by  Na\n+-K+ ATPase . \nInhibitors of SGLT2 are known as glifozins. Since they prevent renal glucose reabsorption, they are used in the treat-ment of diabetes mellitus.\n\u2022 In the small intestine, the sodium-dependent transport of glucose is mediated by a related cotransporter, Sodium \nGLucose co Transporter- 1 (SGLT1). The absorption of glucose is dependent on the ATP hydrolysis by Na\n+-K+ ATPase  \n(Fig. 5.17 ). Since the latter requires transport of Na+ for functioning, in conditions like diarrhea where energy stores in \nthe body has to be replenished by administration of carbohydrates, intake of carbohydrates alone will not be sufficient to enable glucose absorption. This is the basis of administering solutions containing both carbohydrates (glucose as such, or sucrose, or starch) and salt in oral rehydration therapy for the treatment of fluid and energy loss in diarrhea. Glucose is transported into the interstitium by a GLUT transporter.\n\u2022 Recommended daily dietary intake of sodium is <2 g (<5 g NaCl) and that of potassium is >3.5 g. Increased intake \nof sodium is associated with risks of developing hypertension and heart diseases. Potassium lowers blood pressure by acting on the vascular walls, relaxing them. Potassium also promotes excretion of sodium\u2014further augmenting its cardioprotective effects.\n\u2022 Since inhibition of ACE or blocking angiotensin-II receptors can lead to diminished action of angiotensin-II\u2014i.e., reduc-\ntion in vasoconstriction and aldosterone synthesis\u2014ultimately leading to decreased ECF Na\n+ levels, ECF volume and \nblood pressure, drugs that bring about these effects like ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (e.g., losartan) are used in the treatment of hypertension.\n\u2022 Angiotensin-II is inactivated via an enzymatic hydrolysis by angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). This enzyme \nis found bound to the membranes of lung, intestine, etc. SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent for the novel coronavirus disease\u2014COVID-19, gains entry into the cell by binding to these proteins on the cell surface.\n\u2022 Chloride (Cl\n\u2212): Physiological functions of chloride are mostly similar to that of Na+. Reference interval for plasma chlo-\nride concentration is 102\u2013109 mmol/l. An increase or decrease in the chloride levels in the plasma as such does not lead to any clinical manifestations, and except for certain acid-base disorders (see p. 40), chloride levels in plasma increase or decrease in parallel to sodium levels.\n\u2022 Estimation of urine osmolality can be of use in diagnosis of certain disorders. For instance, urine osmolality is low in \ndiabetes insipidus and in chronic renal failure\u2014in both these conditions, the concentrating capacity of the renal tubules is lost, and a diluted urine is excreted. On the other hand, urine osmolality is high in SIADH and in dehydration. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   65 24-10-2020   12:07:30"

Water and Electrolyte Balance of Body Fluids\n\u2022 The term Fractional Excretion of sodium (or FENa) refers to the percentage of sodium that is filtered by the kidneys, which \nis excreted in urine.

FENa is given by the formula:\nFENa  = Urine Sodium/Serum Sodium\nUrine Creatinine/Serum Creatinine \u00d7 100\n  Reference interval is 1%\u20132%. In conditions like hypovolemia, where the body tries to conserve sodium, the FeNa is <1%.\n\u2022 Intravenous (i.v) fluid therapy can be for maintenance (in patients who are unable to consume food and water orally) or \nfor replacement (for correction of water/electrolyte imbalance). The choice of i.v fluids highly depends on the underlying clinical condition. For example, normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is used in hypovolemic hyponatremia for sodium replace-ment, while half-normal saline with 5% dextrose and 20 mmol/l of potassium is usually used as a maintenance fluid.\nNa+-K+ATPaseSGLUT1/2GLUT1/2InterstitiumLumen of renal \ntubules/small intestine\nK+K+ Na+  Na+\n Na+ Na+Glucose Glucose\nGlucose Glucose\nCell\nFigure 5.17 \nSecondary active transport of glucose from the lumen into the interstitium in small intestine and renal tubules.\nIX. Chapter Summary\nWater gives a major contribution to the total body weight and is distributed in distinct compartments in the body. Most \nof the total body water is present intracellularly. Intracellular and extracellular compartments differ in the composition of electrolytes and proteins. ECF is mainly constituted by plasma and its filtrate\u2014ISF . The movement of fluid between these two is primarily determined by the osmotic pressure contributed by the plasma proteins. \nTotal body water is determined by the water intake and water removal from the body. Water balance is maintained by two \nmechanisms\u2014stimulation of thirst and renal water reabsorption. The main regulator of body water is plasma osmolality. Increased plasma osmolality leads to stimulation of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which stimulates thirst and also the release of AVP . AVP causes increased free water absorption from the nephrons. Water balance is altered in SIADH and diabetes insipidus.\nSodium is the major extracellular cation, while potassium is the major intracellular cation. Sodium-potassium ATPase  is \nthe mechanism behind this differential distribution. Since it is an electrogenic pump, sodium and potassium are required for generation of various potentials and functioning of excitable tissues. The regulation of sodium and potassium is carried out by a number of mechanisms\u2014most of them involving hormones like aldosterone and natriuretic peptides. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a key player in the maintenance of sodium and potassium balance in the body.\nAbnormalities in the level of electrolytes\u2014both increase and decrease\u2014can be fatal and should be promptly identified \nand treated. Sodium disorders present usually with neurological manifestations, while potassium disorders are associated with aberrations in the cardiac electrical activity. These disorders are classified, respectively, based on the ECF volume status or the etiology, so as to help make an easy diagnosis and initiate early treatment.\nEstimation of serum electrolytes, in modern clinical laboratories, is mostly done with the help of ISEs; the heart of such \nan electrode is the ion-selective membrane.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   66 24-10-2020   12:07:30"

The emergency team in a hospital was directed to \nattend a 45-year-old male (body weight, 60 kg), who was undergoing treatment for bacterial sepsis and was on intravenous antibiotics, because he developed cardiac arrest. The intern incharge of the patient, who had just begun his clinical rota-tions, gave a history of administering a solution of 20% potassium chloride intravenously, mistaking it for an antibiotic. Before the administration of the drug, the plasma potassium of the patient was recorded to be 4.0 mmol/l. A blood sample sent to the lab soon after the cardiac event (about 5 minutes after the emergency team reaching the patient) showed a plasma potassium level of 5.0 mmol/l. Answer the questions given below (Presume that there was no intracellular shift of K\n+ \nduring the entire duration of these events).\nA. What is the volume of plasma in this individual?Answer\u2014A:  60% of the body weight (in this case, 60 kg) \nis contributed by water. Hence, total body water here is 36 L. 33% of this is in the ECF , which is 12 L. Plasma consti-tutes 1/4\nth of the ECF , therefore plasma volume is 3 L.\nAnswer\u2014B:  Increase in plasma K+ concentration is \n1 mmol/l (from 4.0 mmol/l to 5.0 mmol/l). Given that K+ \nwas distributed only extracellularly during the time of this increase, total K\n+ that entered the ECF = 1 mmol/l x ECF \nvolume (which is 12 L). Therefore, 12 mmol of K+ was \nadministered to this patient.\nB. How many millimoles of potassium was admin-\nistered to this patient?Answer\u2014C:  Even though hyperkalemic levels (>5.0 \nmmol/l) of plasma K+ concentration was never docu-\nmented in this patient, the actual K+ level reached may \nnot be so. Soon after administration of potassium chlo-ride, 12 mmol of K\n+ entered the plasma (to be distrib-\nuted in a volume of 3 L). This would have contributed to a sudden increase in plasma K\n+ by 12/3 = 4 mmol/l. Adding \nthis to the initial plasma K+ concentration of 4.0 mmol/l, \nthe peak plasma K+ following the intravenous administra-\ntion of potassium chloride would have been 8 mmol/l. This could have incited the cardiac arrest.C. What is the reason for the cardiac arrest?\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   68 24-10-2020   12:07:30"

He also complained of severe abdominal cramps and mild fever. On further interrogation, he revealed that he was consuming food that was not prop-erly stored, the previous day before the onset of the symptoms. He also told that he was drinking bottled water and packed fruit juices after the onset of loose stools.\n On examination, he looked exhausted and drowsy. \nHis pulse was 110/minute with low volume. His skin and oral mucosa were dry. The plasma sodium level was 125 mmol/l. As his condition seemed quite critical, the doctor on duty started a normal saline drip immediately. He was kept under observation and was switched to oral rehydration solution. He was discharged, after he showed significant improvement during the hospital stay.\nA. What is the reason for hyponatremia in this \npatient?Answer\u2014A:  Since the symptoms developed within \n24 hours of consumption of non-properly stored food, the likely causative organism for diarrhea is a toxin-producing bacteria. Secretory diarrhea, seen in such cases, results in loss of fluid isotonic to that of plasma from the gastro-intestinal tract. This, along with consumption of fluids that are devoid of sodium (bottled water and packed fruit juices in this case), lead to development of hypovolemic hyponatremia.\nAnswer\u2014B:  Clinically, hypovolemia or reduction in the \nvolume of ECF manifests as increased thirst, dry skin and mucous membranes, diminished peripheral pulses, hypotension, tachycardia (due to baroreceptor reflex in response to hypotension), and loss of skin turgor.\nB. What are the clinical signs of low ECF volume?Answer\u2014C:  In the small intestine, the sodium-dependent \ntransport of glucose is mediated by a related cotrans-porter, SGLT1. The absorption of glucose is dependent on the ATP hydrolysis by Na\n+-K+ ATPase. Since the latter \nrequires transport of Na+ for functioning, in conditions \nlike diarrhea where energy stores in the body have to be replenished by administration of carbohydrates, intake of carbohydrates alone will not be sufficient to enable glucose absorption. This is the basis of administering solutions containing both carbohydrates (glucose as such, or sucrose, or starch) and salt in oral rehydration therapy for the treatment of fluid and energy loss in diarrhea.C.

The variation in side chains classifies the amino acid as those with polar side chains, nonpolar side chains, acidic or basic side chains, etc. (Chapter 6). Proteins form enzymes, polypeptide hormones, contractile proteins, collagen, etc. The linear primary structure of the linked amino acids further folds into secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures to enable the protein to perform its various complicated functions (Chapter 7). Protein misfolding is associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Chapter 8 deals with the globular proteins, hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin is responsible for transfer of oxygen to tissues and any derangements in structure leads to diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemias. Myoglobin, on the other hand, works as an oxygen reservoir and carrier within the muscle. The fibrous proteins of the extracellular matrix are collagen and elastin (Chapter 9). They may be fibril forming (skin, cartilage and blood vessels), network forming (basement membrane and corneal epithelium) or fibril associated (cartilage and tendons). Chapter 10 discusses the function of clinically important enzymes which may be used in treatment (e.g., streptokinase ) or diagnosis (e.g., creatine kinase \nisoenzyme [CK-MB] for diagnosis of myocardial infarction). \n While understanding the basic concepts of biochemistry in medicine, the primary healthcare physician must also \nfocus on common diseases associated with proteins like hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, etc., and a clear understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic enzymes which are used in daily practice.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   74 24-10-2020   12:07:31"

Virtually every life process depends on this class of macromole-cules. For example, enzymes and polypeptide hormones direct and regu-late metabolism in the body, whereas contractile proteins in muscle permit movement. In bone, the protein collagen forms a framework for the deposi-tion of calcium phosphate crystals, acting like the steel cables in reinforced concrete. In the bloodstream, proteins, such as hemoglobin and albumin, transport molecules essential to life, whereas immunoglobulins fight infec-tious bacteria and viruses. In short, proteins display an incredible diver-sity of functions, yet all share the common structural feature of being linear polymers of amino acids. This chapter describes the properties of amino acids. Chapter 7 explores how these simple building blocks are joined to form proteins that have unique three-dimensional structures, making them capable of performing specific biologic functions.\nII. STRUCTURE\nAlthough >300 different amino acids have been described in nature, only 20 are commonly found as constituents of mammalian proteins. [Note: These standard amino acids are the only amino acids that are encoded by DNA, the genetic material in the cell (see Chapter 37.II. Genetic Code, p. 633). Nonstandard amino acids are produced by chemical modification of stan-dard amino acids (see p. 125).] Each amino acid has a carboxyl group, a primary amino group (except for proline, which has a secondary amino group), and a distinctive side chain (R group) bonded to the \u03b1-carbon \natom. At physiologic pH (~7.4), the carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (\u2212COO\n\u2212), and the amino group is \nprotonated (\u2212NH 3+) (Fig. 6.1A ). In proteins, almost all of these carboxyl and \namino groups are combined through peptide linkage and, in general, are not available for chemical reaction except for hydrogen bond formation (\nFig. 6.1B ). Thus, it is the nature of the side chains that ultimately dictates Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Classify amino acids based on the variations in their side chains\n\u2022 Describe the physiologically relevant properties of amino acids\nNH-CH-CO-Amino acids combined\nthrough peptide linkages\nRNH-CH-CO\nR\n R\n R\nSide chains determine \nproperties of proteins.BC+H3NCOO\u2013\nH\nC\n+\nH\n3\nN\nCOCO\n\u2013\nH\nThese are common to\nall a-amino acids.Free amino acid\nat physiologic pH\nRa\nC\nH\na\nRR\nR\nSide chain \nis distinctive for each amino acid.a-Carbon is\nlinked to the carboxylate, amino,and R groups.A\nAmino\ngroupCarboxylate\ngroup\nFigure 6.1\nA, B.

However, there \nis also a 21st and 22nd amino acid which is selenocysteine (Sec) and pyrro-lysine (Pyl). Sec and Pyl are rare amino acids coded by UGA and UAG, respectively. They are cotranslationally inserted into proteins and usually function as stop signals.\nA.

            "Text": "78 6. Amino Acids\n 1. Location in proteins:  In proteins found in aqueous solutions (a polar \nenvironment), the side chains of the nonpolar amino acids tend to cluster together in the interior of the protein (\nFig. 6.4 ). This phenom-\nenon, known as the hydrophobic effect, is the result of the hydro-phobicity of the nonpolar R groups, which act much like droplets of oil that coalesce in an aqueous environment. By filling up the interior of the folded protein, these nonpolar R groups help give the protein its three-dimensional shape. However, for proteins that are located in a hydrophobic environment, such as a membrane, the nonpolar R groups are found on the outside surface of the protein, interacting with the lipid environment (see \nFig. 6.4 ). The importance of these \nhydrophobic interactions in stabilizing protein structure is discussed on p. 94.\nSickle cell anemia, a disease of red blood cells that causes \nthem to become sickle shaped rather than disc shaped, results from the replacement of polar glutamate with nonpolar valine at the sixth position in the E subunit of hemoglobin A \n(see p. 112).\n 2. Proline:  Proline differs from other amino acids in that its side chain \nand \u03b1-amino nitrogen form a rigid, five-membered ring structure \n(Fig. 6.5 ). Proline, then, has a secondary (rather than a primary) amino \ngroup. It is frequently referred to as an \u201cimino acid.\u201d The unique geometry of proline contributes to the formation of the fibrous struc-ture of collagen (see p. 123), but it interrupts the \u03b1-helices found in \nglobular proteins (see p. 92).\nB. Amino acids with uncharged polar side chains\nThese amino acids have zero net charge at physiologic pH, although the side chains of cysteine and tyrosine can lose a proton at an alka-line pH (see \nFig. 6.3 ). Serine, threonine, and tyrosine each contain a \npolar hydroxyl group that can participate in hydrogen bond formation (\nFig. 6.6 ). The side chains of asparagine and glutamine each contain a \ncarbonyl group and an amide group, both of which can also participate in hydrogen bonds.\n 1. Disulfide bond:  The side chain of cysteine contains a sulfhydryl \n(thiol) group (\u2212SH), which is an important component of the active site of many enzymes. In proteins, the \u2013SH groups of two cyste-ines can be oxidized to form a covalent cross-link called a disul-fide bond (\u2212S\u2013S\u2013). Two disulfide-linked cysteines are referred to as cystine. (See p. 94 for a further discussion of disulfide bond forma-tion.) Cystine is the least soluble of all the essential amino acids and is insoluble at physiological pH of urine. Increased excretion of cystine, due to an autosomal recessive genetic condition, can lead to its precipitation in urinary tract, producing renal stones.\nMany extracellular proteins are stabilized by disulfide bonds. \nAlbumin, a blood protein that functions as a transporter for a variety of molecules, is an example.Cell\nmembrane\nPolar amino acids\n(    ) cluster onthe surface of soluble proteins.\nCell\nNonpolar aminoacids (    ) cluster on the surface of membrane proteins.Nonpolar amino acids (   ) cluster in the interior of soluble proteins.\nSoluble protein Membrane protein\nFigure 6.4\nLocation of nonpolar amino acids in \nsoluble and membrane proteins.\nC+H3NCOOH\nH\nCH3\nAlanineCOOH\nH\nProlineC\nCH2+H2N\nH2CPrimary amino\ngroup  Secondary amino\ngroup\nCH2\nFigure 6.5\nComparison of the secondary amino \ngroup found in proline with the primary amino group found in other amino acids such as alanine.\nC+H3NCOOH\nCH2\nTyrosine\nHydrogen\nbondO\nCOHH\nCarbonyl\ngroup\nFigure 6.6\nHydrogen bond between the phenolic \nhydroxyl group of tyrosine and another molecule containing a carbonyl group.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   78 24-10-2020   12:07:33"

Side chains as attachment sites for other compounds:  The polar \nhydroxyl group of serine, threonine, and (rarely) tyrosine can serve as a site of attachment for structures such as a phosphate group. In addition, the amide group of asparagine, as well as the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine, can serve as a site of attachment for oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins (see p. 273).\nC. Amino acids with acidic side chains\nThe amino acids aspartic acid and glutamic acid are proton donors. At physiologic pH, the side chains of these amino acids are fully ionized, containing a negatively charged carboxylate group (\u2212COO\n\u2212). The fully \nionized forms are called aspartate and glutamate.\nD. Amino acids with basic side chains\nThe side chains of the basic amino acids accept protons (see Fig. 6.3 ). At \nphysiologic pH, the R groups of lysine and arginine are fully ionized and positively charged. In contrast, the free amino acid histidine is weakly basic and largely uncharged at physiologic pH. However, when histi-dine is incorporated into a protein, its R group can be either positively charged (protonated) or neutral, depending on the ionic environment provided by the protein. This important property of histidine contrib-utes to the buffering role it plays in the functioning of such proteins as hemoglobin (see p. 106).\nE. Abbreviations and symbols for commonly occurring \namino acids\nEach amino acid name has an associated three-letter abbreviation and \na one-letter symbol ( Fig. 6.7 ). The one-letter codes are determined by \nthe following rules.\n 1. Unique first letter:  If only one amino acid begins with a given letter, \nthen that letter is used as its symbol. For example, V = valine.\n 2. Most commonly occurring amino acids have priority:  If more than \none amino acid begins with a particular letter, the most common of these amino acids receives this letter as its symbol. For example, glycine is more common than glutamate, so G = glycine.\n 3. Similar sounding names:  Some one-letter symbols sound like \nthe amino acid they represent. For example, F = phenylalanine, or W = tryptophan (\u201ctwyptophan\u201d as Elmer Fudd would say).\n 4. Letter close to initial letter:  For the remaining amino acids, a one-\nletter symbol is assigned that is as close in the alphabet as possible to the initial letter of the amino acid, for example, K = lysine. Furthermore, B is assigned to Asx, signifying either aspartic acid or asparagine; Z is assigned to Glx, signifying either glutamic acid or glutamine; and X is assigned to an unidentified amino acid.\nF. Amino acid isomers\nBecause the \u03b1-carbon of an amino acid is attached to four different \nchemical groups, it is an asymmetric (chiral) atom. Glycine is the excep-tion because its \u03b1-carbon has two hydrogen substituents Amino acids \nwith a chiral \u03b1-carbon exist in two different isomeric forms, designated \nD and L, which are enantiomers, or mirror images ( Fig. 6.8 ).

In addition, each of the acidic and basic \namino acids contains an ionizable group in its side chain. Thus, both free amino acids and some amino acids combined in peptide linkages can act as buffers. Acids may be defined as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors. Acids (or bases) described as weak ionize to only a limited extent. The concentration of protons ([H\n+]) in aqueous solution is expressed as pH, \nwhere pH = log 1/[H+] or \u2013log [H+]. The quantitative relationship between the \npH of the solution and concentration of a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A\n\u2212) is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\nA. Equation derivation\nConsider the release of a proton by a weak acid represented by HA:\nHA\nweak acid  H+\nproton + A\u2013\nsalt form or conjugate base\nThe salt or conjugate base, A\u2212, is the ionized form of a weak acid. By \ndefinition, the dissociation constant of the acid, K a, is:\nKa = [H+] [A\u2013]\n[HA]\n[Note: The larger the K a, the stronger the acid, because most of the HA \nhas dissociated into H+ and A\u2212. Conversely, the smaller the K a, the less \nacid has dissociated and, therefore, the weaker the acid.] By solving for the [H\n+] in the above equation, taking the logarithm of both sides of \nthe equation, multiplying both sides of the equation by \u22121, and substi-tuting pH = \u2212log [H\n+] and pK a = \u2212log K a, we obtain the Henderson-\nHasselbalch equation:\npH = pK a + log [A\u2013]\n[HA]\nB. Buffers\nA buffer is a solution that resists change in pH following the addition \nof an acid or base. A buffer can be created by mixing a weak acid (HA) with its conjugate base (A\n\u2212). If an acid such as HCl is added to \na buffer, A\u2212 can neutralize it, being converted to HA in the process. If \na base is added, HA can likewise neutralize it, being converted to A\u2212 \nin the process. Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pK\na, but a conjugate acid-base pair can still serve as an effective \nbuffer when the pH of a solution is within approximately \u00b11 pH unit of the pK\na. If the amounts of HA and A\u2212 are equal, the pH is equal to the \npKa. As shown in Figure 6.9 , a solution containing acetic acid (HA = \nCH3 \u2013 COOH) and acetate (A\u2212 = CH 3 \u2013 COO\u2212) with a pK a of 4.8 resists a \nchange in pH from pH 3.8 to 5.8, with maximum buffering at pH 4.8.

At pH values greater than the pK a, \nthe deprotonated base form (CH 3 \u2013 COO\u2212) is the predominant species.\nC. Amino acid titration\nThe titration curve of an amino acid can be analyzed in the same way as described for acetic acid.\n 1. Carboxyl group dissociation:  Consider alanine, for example, which \ncontains an ionizable \u03b1-carboxyl and \u03b1-amino group. [Note: Its \u2013CH\n3 \nR group is nonionizable.] At a low (acidic) pH, both of these groups are protonated (\nFig. 6.10 ). As the pH of the solution is raised, the \n\u2212COOH group of form I can dissociate by donating a H+ to the \nmedium. The release of a H+ results in the formation of the carbox-\nylate group, \u2212COO\u2212. This structure is shown as form II, which is the \ndipolar form of the molecule (see Fig. 6.10 ). This form, also called \na zwitterion (from the German word for \u201chybrid\u201d), is the isoelectric form of alanine, that is, it has an overall (net) charge of zero.\n 2. Application of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  The disso-\nciation constant of the carboxyl group of an amino acid is called K\n1, rather than K a, because the molecule contains a second titrat-\nable group. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to analyze the dissociation of the carboxyl group of alanine in the same way as described for acetic acid:\nK1 = [H+] [II]\n[I]\n   where I is the fully protonated form of alanine and II is the isoelec-\ntric form of alanine (see Fig. 6.10 ). This equation can be rearranged \nand converted to its logarithmic form to yield:\npH = pK 1 + log [II]\n[I]\n 3. Amino group dissociation:  The second titratable group of alanine \nis the amino (\u2212NH 3+) group shown in Figure 6.10 . Because this is \na much weaker acid than the \u2013COOH group, it has a much smaller dissociation constant, K\n2. [Note: Its pK a is, therefore, larger.] Release \nof a H+ from the protonated amino group of form II results in the fully \ndeprotonated form of alanine, form III (see Fig. 6.10 ).\nCOOH\nFORM I\nAlanine in acid solution\n(pH <2)\nNet charge = +1CH3C+H3N HCOO\u2013\nFORM  II\nAlanine in neutral solution\n(pH ~6)\nNet charge = 0\n(isoelectric form)CH3C+H3N HCOO\u2013\nFORM III\nAlanine in basic solution\n(pH >10)\nNet charge = \u20131CH3C H2N HH2O OH\u2013\nH+H2O OH\u2013\nH+\npK1 = 2.3 pK2 = 9.1\nFigure 6.10\nIonic forms of alanine in acidic, neutral, and basic solutions.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   81 24-10-2020   12:07:34"

            "Text": "82 6. Amino Acids\n 4. Alanine pKs:  The sequential dissociation of H+ from the carboxyl \nand amino groups of alanine is summarized in Figure 6.10 . Each \ntitratable group has a pK a that is numerically equal to the pH at \nwhich exactly one half of the H+ have been removed from that \ngroup. The pK a for the most acidic group (\u2212COOH) is pK 1, whereas \nthe pK a for the next most acidic group (\u2212NH 3+) is pK 2. [Note: The \npKa of the \u03b1-carboxyl group of amino acids is ~2, whereas that of \nthe \u03b1-amino group is ~9.]\n 5. Alanine titration curve:  By applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch \nequation to each dissociable acidic group, it is possible to calcu-late the complete titration curve of a weak acid. \nFigure 6.11  shows \nthe change in pH that occurs during the addition of base to the fully protonated form of alanine (I) to produce the completely deproton-ated form (III). Note the following:\n a. Buffer pairs:  The \u2013COOH/\u2013COO\n\u2212 pair can serve as a buffer in \nthe pH region around pK 1, and the \u2013NH 3+/\u2013NH 2 pair can buffer \nin the region around pK 2.\n b. When pH = pK:  When the pH is equal to pK 1 (2.3), equal \namounts of forms I and II of alanine exist in solution. When the pH is equal to pK\n2 (9.1), equal amounts of forms II and III are \npresent in solution.\n c. Isoelectric point:  At neutral pH, alanine exists predominantly \nas the dipolar form II in which the amino and carboxyl groups are ionized, but the net charge is zero. The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which an amino acid is electrically neutral, that is, in which the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges. For an amino acid, such as alanine, that has only two dissociable hydrogens (one from the \u03b1-carboxyl \nand one from the \u03b1-amino group), the pI is the average of pK\n1 \nand pK 2 (pI = [2.3 + 9.1]/2 = 5.7) as shown in Figure 6.11 . The \npI is, thus, midway between pK 1 (2.3) and pK 2 (9.1). pI corre-\nsponds to the pH at which the form II (with a net charge of zero) predominates and at which there are also equal amounts of forms I (net charge of +1) and III (net charge of \u22121).\n 6. Net charge at neutral pH:  At physiologic pH, amino acids have a \nnegatively charged group (\u2212COO\n\u2212) and a positively charged group \n(\u2212NH 3+), both attached to the \u03b1-carbon. [Note: Glutamate, aspartate, \nhistidine, arginine, and lysine have additional potentially charged groups in their side chains.] Substances such as amino acids that can act either as an acid or a base are defined as amphoteric and are referred to as ampholytes (amphoteric electrolytes).\nD. Other applications of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to calculate how the pH of a physiologic solution responds to changes in the concen-tration of a weak acid and/or its corresponding salt form. For example, in the bicarbonate buffer system, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts how shifts in the bicarbonate ion concentration, [HCO\n3\u2212], and \nthe carbon dioxide concentration [CO 2] influence pH ( Fig. 6.12A ). The \nequation is also useful for calculating the abundance of ionic forms of acidic and basic drugs. For example, most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases (\nFig. 6.12B ). Acidic drugs (HA) release a H+, causing a \ncharged anion (A\u2212) to form.02468 1 001.02.0\npHEquivalents OH\u2013 added\npK2 = 9.1[II] = [III]\n0.51.5\npK1 = 2.3[I] = [II]pI = 5.7Region of \nbufferingRegion of \nbuffering\n0\n 2\n 4\n0\np\n0\n[II] = [III\n]\nRegion o f \nbuffering\n6\n 8\n 10\npH\nppppp\npKKKKKK\n2222\n= 9.\n==\n= 2.3\np\nCOOH\nFORM ICH3C+H3N HCOO\u2013\nFORM IIICH3C H2N H\nCOO\u2013\nFORM  IICH3C+H3N H\nFigure 6.11\nThe titration curve of alanine.\nSeparation of plasma proteins \nby charge typically is done at a pH above the pI of the major proteins. Therefore, the charge on the proteins is negative. In an electric field, the proteins will move toward the positive electrode at a rate determined by their net nega-tive charge. Variations in the mobility pattern are sugges-tive of certain diseases. Isoelectric focusing is the first step of two-dimensional elec-trophoresis and involves the separation of proteins by their pI (isoelectric point) values. The next step is separation of proteins, on the basis of their molecular weights, by sodium dodecyl sulfate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   82 24-10-2020   12:07:35"

However, the protonated form \nof basic drugs is usually charged, and the loss of a proton produces the uncharged base (B).\nBH+  B + H+\nA drug passes through membranes more readily if it is uncharged. Thus, for a weak acid, such as aspirin, the uncharged HA can permeate through membranes, but A\n\u2212 cannot. Likewise, for a weak base, such as morphine, \nthe uncharged B form permeates through the cell membrane, but BH+ \ndoes not. Therefore, the effective concentration of the permeable form of each drug at its absorption site is determined by the relative concen-trations of the charged (impermeant) and uncharged (permeant) forms. The ratio between the two forms is determined by the pH at the site of absorption and by the strength of the weak acid or base, which is repre-sented by the pK\na of the ionizable group. The Henderson-Hasselbalch \nequation is useful in determining how much drug is found on either side of a membrane that separates two compartments that differ in pH, for example, the stomach (pH 1.0\u20131.5) and blood plasma (pH 7.4).\nIV. CONCEPT MAPS\nStudents sometimes view biochemistry as a list of facts or equations to be memorized, rather than a body of concepts to be understood. Details provided to enrich understanding of these concepts inadvertently turn into distractions. What seems to be missing is a road map\u2014a guide that provides the student with an understanding of how various topics fit together to \u201ctell a story.\u201d Therefore, in this text, a series of biochem-ical concept maps have been created to graphically illustrate relationships between ideas presented in a chapter and to show how the information can be grouped or organized. A concept map is, thus, a tool for visualizing the connections between concepts. Material is represented in a hierarchic fashion, with the most inclusive, most general concepts at the top of the map, and the more specific, less general concepts arranged beneath. The concept maps ideally function as templates or guides for organizing infor-mation, so the student can readily find the best ways to integrate new infor-mation into knowledge they already possess. Concept map construction is described below.\nA. Concept boxes and links\nEducators define concepts as \u201cperceived regularities in events or objects.\u201d In the biochemical maps, concepts include abstractions (for example, free energy), processes (for example, oxidative phosphor-ylation), and compounds (for example, glucose 6-phosphate). These broadly defined concepts are prioritized with the central idea positioned at the top of the page. The concepts that follow from this central idea are then drawn in boxes (\nFig. 6.13A ). The size of the type indicates the \nrelative importance of each idea. Lines are drawn between concept boxes to show which are related. The label on the line defines the rela-tionship between two concepts, so that it reads as a valid statement (that is, the connection creates meaning). The lines with arrowheads indicate in which direction the connection should be read (\nFig. 6.14 ).\nH2CO3 HCO 3\u2013H+H2O CO2+ +BICARBONATE AS A  BUFFER\nDRUG ABSORPTIONA\nB\nA\u2013\nHALipid\nmembrane\nLUMEN OF \nSTOMACHSTOMACHLUNG\nALVEOLI\nBLOODH+\nH+\nH+A\u2013\nHAH+\u2022 At the pH of the stomach (1.5),\na drug like aspirin (weak acid,pK = 3.5) will be largely protonated(COOH) and, thus, uncharged.\n\u2022 Uncharged drugs generally cross\nmembranes more rapidly than docharged molecules.\u2022 pH = pK + log[Drug-H][Drug\u2013 ]\u2022 An increase in HCO3\u2013 causes \nthe pH to rise.\n\u2022 Pulmonary obstruction causes an\nincrease in carbon dioxide, whichcauses the pH to fall, resultingin respiratory acidosis.\u2022 pH = pK + log [HCO3\u2013 ]\n[CO2]\nFigure 6.12\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is \nused to predict: ( A) changes in pH as the \nconcentrations of bicarbonate (HCO 3\u2212) \nor carbon dioxide (CO 2) are altered and \n(B) the ionic forms of drugs.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   83 24-10-2020   12:07:37"

Dimercaprol has SH groups, and is used as an antidote for heavy metal poisoning.\nCystinuria is an inherited disorder of excessive excretion of cysteine in \nurine. Stones in urinary tract are formed because cysteine gets converted to cystine in the acidic milieu of urine. Alkalinization of urine is done in an effort to decrease the formation of stones. \nPosttranslational modifications of arginine may form citrulline. \nAutoantibodies may form against these citrullinated proteins leading to certain types of arthritis.\nVI. Chapter Summary\nEach amino acid has an \u03b1-carboxyl  group and a primary \u03b1-amino group  \n(except for proline , which has a secondary amino group ). At physiologic \npH, the \u03b1-carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged \ncarboxylate ion (\u2212COO\u2212), and the \u03b1-amino group is protonated (\u2212NH 3+). \nEach amino acid also contains one of 20 distinctive side chains  attached \nto the \u03b1-carbon atom. The chemical nature of this R group  determines the \nfunction of an amino acid in a protein and provides the basis for classi-fication of the amino acids as nonpolar , uncharged polar , acidic  (polar \nnegative ), or basic  (polar positive ). All free amino acids, plus charged \namino acids in peptide chains, can serve as buffers . The quantitative rela-\ntionship between the pH of a solution and the concentration of a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A\n\u2212) is described by the Henderson-\nHasselbalch equation . Buffering occurs within \u00b11 pH unit of the pK a and \nis maximal when pH = pK a, at which [A\u2212] = [HA]. Because the \u03b1-carbon \nof each amino acid (except glycine) is attached to four different chemical groups, it is asymmetric ( chiral ), and amino acids exist in \nD- and L-isomeric \nforms that are optically active mirror images ( enantiomers ). The L-form of \namino acids is found in proteins synthesized by the human body.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   84 24-10-2020   12:07:37"

The linear sequence of the linked amino acids contains the information necessary to generate a protein molecule with a unique three-dimensional shape that determines function. The complexity of protein structure is best analyzed by considering the molecule in terms of four organizational levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary (\nFig. 7.1 ). \nAn examination of these hierarchies of increasing complexity has revealed that certain structural elements are repeated in a wide variety of proteins, suggesting that there are general rules regarding the ways in which proteins achieve their native, functional form. These repeated structural elements range from simple combinations of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets forming small \nmotifs to the complex folding of polypeptide domains of multifunctional proteins (see p. 94).\nProteins may be classified based on their shape (fibrous and globular \nproteins), functions, conjugated group or biological value. Classification according to function includes structural (collagen), transport (hemoglobin) and catalytic proteins (enzymes). Proteins may also be classified according to the conjugated groups, e.g., metalloproteins (ceruloplasmin), hemopro-teins (hemoglobin), nucleoproteins (histones), glycoproteins, lipoproteins, etc. Most proteins are incomplete proteins, i.e., they lack presence of all the 20 amino acids except egg protein which has the biological value of being a complete protein.\nII. PRIMARY STRUCTURE\nThe sequence of amino acids in a protein is called the primary structure of the protein. Understanding the primary structure of proteins is important because many genetic diseases result in proteins with abnormal amino acid sequences, which cause improper folding and loss or impairment of normal Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Explain the structural organization of proteins\n\u2022 Describe the clinical significance of protein misfolding \nC NCH\nHC N CH\nCH3 OH\nN\nHC\nOCO\nCN\nC\nN\nHH\nC O\nC\nCN\nHO\nC\nCO\nOHN\nCC\nN\nHN\nHR\nC RCR\nCR\nQuaternary\nstructure4Tertiarystructure32SecondarystructurePrimarystructure1H\nFigure 7.1\nFour hierarchies of protein structure.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   88 24-10-2020   12:07:39"

Protein sequencing by Sanger\u2019s/Edman\u2019s method or mass spectrometry may be used to study the primary structure of a protein.\nA. Peptide bond\nIn proteins, amino acids are joined covalently by peptide bonds, which are amide linkages between the \u03b1-carboxyl group of one amino acid \nand the \u03b1-amino group of another. For example, valine and alanine \ncan form the dipeptide valylalanine through the formation of a peptide bond (\nFig. 7.2 ). Peptide bonds are resistant to conditions that denature \nproteins, such as heating and high concentrations of urea (see p. 95). Prolonged exposure to a strong acid or base at elevated temperatures is required to break these bonds nonenzymically (see p. 89).\n 1. Naming the peptide:  By convention, the free amino end (N-terminal) \nof the peptide chain is written to the left and the free carboxyl end (C-terminal) to the right. Therefore, all amino acid sequences are read from the N- to the C-terminal end. For example, in \nFigure 7.2A , \nthe order of the amino acids in the dipeptide is valine, alanine. Linkage of \u226550 amino acids through peptide bonds results in an unbranched chain called a polypeptide, or protein. Each component amino acid is called a residue because it is the portion of the amino acid remaining after the atoms of water are lost in the formation of the peptide bond. When a peptide is named, all amino acid resi-dues have their suffixes (-ine, -an, -ic, or -ate) changed to -yl, with the exception of the C-terminal amino acid. For example, a tripep-tide composed of an N-terminal valine, a glycine, and a C-terminal leucine is called valylglycylleucine.\n 2. Peptide bond characteristics:  The peptide bond has a partial \ndouble-bond character, that is, it is shorter than a single bond and is rigid and planar (\nFig. 7.2B ). This prevents free rotation around the \nbond between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen of the peptide bond. However, the bonds between the \u03b1-carbons and the \u03b1-amino \nor \u03b1-carboxyl groups can be freely rotated (although they are limited \nby the size and character of the R groups). This allows the poly-peptide chain to assume a variety of possible conformations. The peptide bond is almost always in the trans configuration (instead of the cis; see \nFig. 7.2B ), in large part because of steric interference of \nthe R groups (side chains) when in the cis position.\n 3. Peptide bond polarity:  Like all amide linkages, the \u2212C=O and \u2212NH \ngroups of the peptide bond are uncharged, and neither accept nor release protons over the pH range of 2\u201312. Thus, the charged groups present in polypeptides consist solely of the N-terminal (\u03b1-amino) group, the C-terminal ( \u03b1-carboxyl) group, and any ionized \ngroups present in the side chains of the constituent amino acids. The \u2212C=O and \u2212NH groups of the peptide bond are polar, however, and are involved in hydrogen bonds (for example, in \u03b1-helices and \n\u03b2-sheets), as described on pp. 91\u201392.\nB.

This treatment cleaves the peptide bonds and releases the individual amino acids, which can be separated by cation-exchange chromatography. In this technique, a mixture of amino acids is applied to a column that contains a resin to which a negatively charged group is tightly attached. [Note: If the attached group is positively charged, the column becomes an anion-exchange column.] The amino acids bind to the column with different affinities, depending on their charges, hydro-phobicity, and other characteristics. Each amino acid is sequentially released from the chromatography column by eluting with solutions of increasing ionic strength and pH (\nFig. 7.3 ). The separated amino acids \ncontained in the eluate from the column are quantitated by heating them with ninhydrin (a reagent that forms a purple compound with most amino acids, ammonia, and amines). The amount of each amino acid is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of light absorbed by the ninhydrin derivative. The analysis described above is performed using an amino acid analyzer, an automated machine whose components are depicted in \nFigure 7.3 .\nC. Sequencing the peptide from its N-terminal end\nSequencing is a stepwise process of identifying the specific amino acid at each position in the peptide chain, beginning at the N-terminal end. Phenylisothiocyanate, known as Edman reagent, is used to label the amino-terminal residue under mildly alkaline conditions (\nFig. 7.4 ). The \nresulting phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative introduces an instability in the N-terminal peptide bond such that it can be hydrolyzed without cleaving the other peptide bonds. The identity of the amino acid deriva-tive can then be determined. Edman reagent can be applied repeatedly to the shortened peptide obtained in each previous cycle. Automated sequencers are now used.\nD. Cleaving the polypeptide into smaller fragments\nMany polypeptides have a primary structure composed of >100 amino acids. Such molecules cannot be sequenced directly from end to end. However, these large molecules can be cleaved at specific sites and the resulting fragments sequenced. By using more than one cleaving agent (enzymes and/or chemicals) on separate samples of the puri-fied polypeptide, overlapping fragments can be generated that permit the proper ordering of the sequenced fragments, thereby providing a complete amino acid sequence of the large polypeptide (\nFig. 7.5 ).

Endopeptidases  cleave \nwithin a protein.]\nE. Determining a protein\u2019s primary structure by \nDNA sequencing\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a protein-coding region of the DNA \nspecifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. Therefore, if the nucleotide sequence can be determined, knowledge of the genetic code (see p. 633) allows the sequence of nucleotides to be trans-lated into the corresponding amino acid sequence of that polypeptide. This indirect process, although routinely used to obtain the amino acid sequences of proteins, has the limitations of not being able to predict the positions of disulfide bonds in the folded chain and of not identi-fying any amino acids that are modified after their incorporation into the polypeptide (posttranslational modification; see p. 645). Therefore, direct protein sequencing is an extremely important tool for determining the true character of the primary sequence of many polypeptides.\nIII. SECONDARY STRUCTURE\nThe polypeptide backbone does not assume a random three-dimensional structure but, instead, generally forms regular arrangements of amino acids that are located near each other in the linear sequence. These arrangements are termed the secondary structure of the polypeptide. The \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, \nand \u03b2-bend (or, \u03b2-turn) are examples of secondary structures commonly \nencountered in proteins. Each is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between atoms of the peptide backbone. [Note: The collagen \u03b1-chain helix, another \nexample of secondary structure, is discussed on p. 123.] Secondary struc-ture may be studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. \nA. \u03b1-Helix\nSeveral different polypeptide helices are found in nature, but the \u03b1-helix \nis the most common. It is a rigid, right-handed spiral structure, consisting of a tightly packed, coiled polypeptide backbone core, with the side chains of the component \nL-amino acids extending outward from the \ncentral axis to avoid interfering sterically with each other ( Fig. 7.6 ). A \nvery diverse group of proteins contains \u03b1-helices. For example, the kera-\ntins are a family of closely related, rigid, fibrous proteins whose struc-ture is nearly entirely \u03b1-helical. They are a major component of tissues \nsuch as hair and skin. In contrast to keratin, myoglobin, whose struc-ture is also highly \u03b1-helical, is a globular, flexible molecule (see p. 103) \nfound in muscles.\n 1. Hydrogen bonds:  An \u03b1-helix is stabilized by extensive hydrogen \nbonding between the peptide bond carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens that are part of the polypeptide backbone (see \nFig. 7.6 ). \nThe hydrogen bonds extend up and are parallel to the spiral from the carbonyl oxygen of one peptide bond to the \u2013NH group of a peptide linkage four residues ahead in the polypeptide. This insures that all but the first and last peptide bond components are linked to 1. Cleave with trypsin at lysine \n    and argininePeptide of unknown sequence  \n2.

Amino acids per turn:  Each turn of an \u03b1-helix contains 3.6 amino \nacids. Thus, amino acids spaced three or four residues apart in the primary sequence are spatially close together when folded in the \u03b1-helix.\n 3. Amino acids that disrupt an \ud835\udec2-helix:  The R group of an amino \nacid determines its propensity to be in an \u03b1-helix. Proline disrupts \nan \u03b1-helix because its rigid secondary amino group is not geometri-\ncally compatible with the right-handed spiral of the \u03b1-helix. Instead, \nit inserts a kink in the chain, which interferes with the smooth, helical structure. Glycine is also a \u201chelix breaker\u201d because its R group (a hydrogen) confers high flexibility. Additionally, amino acids with charged or bulky R groups (such as glutamate and tryp-tophan, respectively) and those with a branch at the \u03b2-carbon, the \nfirst carbon in the R group (for example, valine), have low \u03b1-helix \npropensity. \nB. \ud835\udec3-Sheet\nThe \u03b2-sheet is another form of secondary structure in which all of the \npeptide bond components are involved in hydrogen bonding ( Fig. 7.7A ). \nBecause the surfaces of \u03b2-sheets appear \u201cpleated,\u201d they are often called \n\u03b2-pleated sheets. [Note: Pleating results from successive \u03b1-carbons \nbeing slightly above or below the plane of the sheet.] Illustrations of protein structure often show \u03b2-strands as broad arrows (\nFig. 7.7B ).\n 1. Formation:  A \u03b2-sheet is formed by two or more peptide segments \n(\u03b2-strands) aligned laterally and stabilized by hydrogen bonds \nbetween the carboxyl and amino groups of amino acids that either are far apart in a single polypeptide (intrachain bonds) or are in different polypeptide chains (interchain bonds). The adja-cent \u03b2-strands are arranged either antiparallel to each other (with \nthe N-termini alternating as shown in \nFig. 7.7B ) or parallel to each \nother (with the N-termini together as shown in Fig. 7.7C ). On each \n\u03b2-strand, the R groups of adjacent amino acids extend in oppo-\nsite directions, above and below the plane of the \u03b2-sheet. [Note: \n\u03b2-sheets are not flat and have a right-handed curl (twist) when \nviewed along the polypeptide backbone.]\n 2. Comparing \ud835\udec2-helices and \ud835\udec3-sheets:  In \u03b2-sheets, the \u03b2-strands are \nalmost fully extended and the hydrogen bonds between the strands are perpendicular to the polypeptide backbone (see \nFig. 7.7A ). In \ncontrast, in \u03b1-helices, the polypeptide is coiled and the hydrogen \nbonds are parallel to the backbone (see Fig. 7.6 ).\nThe orientation of the R groups of the amino acid residues \nin both the \u03b1-helix and the \u03b2-sheet can result in formation \nof polar and nonpolar sides in these secondary structures, thereby making them amphipathic.\nC. \ud835\udec3-Bends (reverse turns, \ud835\udec3-turns)\n\u03b2-Bends reverse the direction of a polypeptide chain, helping it form \na compact, globular shape.

Glycine, the amino acid with the smallest R group, is also frequently found in \u03b2-bends. \u03b2-Bends are stabilized by the forma-\ntion of hydrogen bonds between the first and last residues in the bend.\nD. Nonrepetitive secondary structure\nApproximately one half of an average globular protein is organized into repetitive structures, such as the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet. The remainder \nof the polypeptide chain is described as having a loop or coil confor-mation. These nonrepetitive secondary structures are not random but rather simply have a less regular structure than those described above. [Note: The term \u201crandom coil\u201d refers to the disordered structure obtained when proteins are denatured (see p. 95).] \nE. Supersecondary structures (motifs)\nGlobular proteins are constructed by combining secondary structural elements (that is, \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets, and coils), producing specific \ngeometric patterns, or motifs. These form primarily the core (inte-rior) region of the molecule. They are connected by loop regions (for example, \u03b2-bends) at the surface of the protein. Supersecondary struc-\ntures are usually produced by the close packing of side chains from adjacent secondary structural elements. For example, \u03b1-helices and \n\u03b2-sheets that are adjacent in the amino acid sequence are also usually \n(but not always) adjacent in the final, folded protein. Some of the more common motifs are illustrated in \nFigure 7.8 .\nMotifs may be associated with particular functions. Proteins \nthat bind to DNA contain a limited number of motifs. The helix\u2013loop\u2013helix motif is an example found in a number of proteins that function as transcription factors (see p. 656). Motifs are discussed in detail in Chapter 38: Regulation of Gene Expression, p. 656. \nIV.

Methods to study the tertiary structure include X-ray crys-tallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nA. Domains\nDomains are the fundamental functional and three-dimensional struc-tural units of polypeptides. Polypeptide chains that are >200 amino acids in length generally consist of two or more domains. The core of a domain is built from combinations of supersecondary structural elements (motifs). Folding of the peptide chain within a domain usually occurs independently of folding in other domains. Therefore, each domain has the characteristics of a small, compact globular protein that is structurally independent of the other domains in the polypep-tide chain.\nB. Stabilizing interactions\nThe unique three-dimensional structure of each polypeptide is deter-mined by its amino acid sequence. Interactions between the amino acid side chains guide the folding of the polypeptide to form a compact structure. The following four types of interactions cooperate in stabi-lizing the tertiary structures of globular proteins.\n 1. Disulfide bonds:  A disulfide bond (\u2013S\u2013S\u2013) is a covalent linkage \nformed from the sulfhydryl group (\u2212SH) of each of two cysteine resi-dues to produce a cystine residue (\nFig. 7.9 ). The two cysteines may \nbe separated from each other by many amino acids in the primary sequence of a polypeptide or may even be located on two different polypeptides. The folding of the polypeptide(s) brings the cysteine residues into proximity and permits covalent bonding of their side chains. A disulfide bond contributes to the stability of the three-dimensional shape of the protein molecule and prevents it from becoming denatured in the extracellular environment. For example, many disulfide bonds are found in proteins such as immunoglob-ulins that are secreted by cells. [Note: Protein disulfide isomerase  \nbreaks and reforms disulfide bonds during folding.]\n 2. Hydrophobic interactions:  Amino acids with nonpolar side chains \ntend to be located in the interior of the polypeptide molecule, where they associate with other hydrophobic amino acids (\nFig. 7.10 ). In \ncontrast, amino acids with polar or charged side chains tend to be located on the surface of the molecule in contact with the polar solvent. [Note: Recall that proteins located in nonpolar (lipid) envi-ronments, such as a membrane, exhibit the reverse arrangement (see Fig. 6.4, p. 78).] In each case, a segregation of R groups occurs that is energetically most favorable.\n 3. Hydrogen bonds:  Amino acid side chains containing oxygen- or \nnitrogen-bound hydrogen, such as in the alcohol groups of serine and threonine, can form hydrogen bonds with electron-rich atoms, such as the oxygen of a carboxyl group or carbonyl group of a peptide bond (\nFig. 7.11 ; see also Fig. 6.6, p. 78).

Ionic interactions:  Negatively charged groups, such as the carbox-\nylate group (\u2212COO\u2212) in the side chain of aspartate or glutamate, can \ninteract with positively charged groups such as the amino group (\u2212NH\n3+) in the side chain of lysine (see Fig. 7.11 ).\nC. Protein folding\nInteractions between the side chains of amino acids determine how \na linear polypeptide chain folds into the intricate three-dimensional shape of the functional protein. Protein folding, which occurs within the cell in seconds to minutes, involves nonrandom, ordered pathways. As a peptide folds, secondary structures form, driven by the hydro-phobic effect (that is, hydrophobic groups come together as water is released). These small structures combine to form larger structures. Additional events stabilize secondary structure and initiate formation of tertiary structure. In the last stage, the peptide achieves its fully folded, native (functional) form characterized by a low-energy state (\nFig. 7.12 ). \n[Note: Some biologically active proteins or segments thereof lack a stable tertiary structure. They are referred to as intrinsically disordered proteins.]\nD. Protein denaturation\nDenaturation results in the unfolding and disorganization of a protein\u2019s secondary and tertiary structures without the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Denaturing agents include heat, urea, organic solvents, strong acids or bases, detergents, and ions of heavy metals such as lead. Denaturation may, under ideal conditions, be reversible, such that the protein refolds into its original native structure when the denaturing agent is removed. However, most proteins remain permanently disor-dered once denatured. Denatured proteins are often insoluble and precipitate from solution.\nE. Chaperones in protein folding\nThe information needed for correct protein folding is contained in the primary structure of the polypeptide. However, most denatured proteins do not resume their native conformations even under favorable envi-ronmental conditions. This is because, for many proteins, folding is a facilitated process that requires a specialized group of proteins, referred to as molecular chaperones, and ATP hydrolysis. The chaper-ones, also known as heat shock proteins (HSP), interact with a poly-peptide at various stages during the folding process. Some chaperones bind hydrophobic regions of an extended polypeptide and are impor-tant in keeping the protein unfolded until its synthesis is completed (for example, Hsp70). Others form cage-like macromolecular structures composed of two stacked rings. The partially folded protein enters the cage, binds the central cavity through hydrophobic interactions, folds, and is released (for example, mitochondrial Hsp60).

Protein Structure\nchaperones are sometimes referred to as chaperonins.] Chaperones, \nthen, facilitate correct protein folding by binding to and stabilizing exposed, aggregation-prone hydrophobic regions in nascent (and denatured) polypeptides, preventing premature folding.\nV. QUATERNARY STRUCTURE\nMany proteins consist of a single polypeptide chain and are defined as monomeric proteins. However, others may consist of two or more poly-peptide chains that may be structurally identical or totally unrelated. The arrangement of these polypeptide subunits is called the quaternary struc-ture of the protein. Subunits are held together primarily by noncovalent interactions (for example, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions). Subunits either may function independently of each other or may work cooperatively, as in hemoglobin, in which the binding of oxygen to one subunit of the tetramer increases the affinity of the other subunits for oxygen (see p. 106). X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy may be used to detect spatial arrangements of subunits and to study their interactions.\nIsoforms are proteins that perform the same function but have \ndifferent primary structures. They can arise from different genes or from tissue-specific processing of the product of a single gene. If the proteins function as enzymes, they are referred to as isozymes (see p. 147).\nSupramolecular assembly  is the molecular self-assembly \nof multimeric proteins to form a complex held together by noncovalent bonds. The examples include components of the electron transport chain, ribosome and spliceosome.\nVI. PROTEIN MISFOLDING\nProtein folding is a complex process that can sometimes result in improp-\nerly folded molecules. These misfolded proteins are usually tagged and degraded within the cell (see p. 378). However, this quality control system is not perfect, and intracellular or extracellular aggregates of misfolded proteins can accumulate, particularly as individuals age. Deposits of misfolded proteins are associated with a number of diseases.\nA. Amyloid diseases\nMisfolding of proteins may occur spontaneously or be caused by a mutation in a particular gene, which then produces an altered protein. In addition, some apparently normal proteins can, after abnormal proteolytic cleavage, take on a unique conformation that leads to the spontaneous formation of long, fibrillar protein assemblies consisting of \u03b2-pleated sheets. Accumulation of these insoluble fibrous protein \naggregates, called amyloids, has been implicated in neurodegenerative Formation of\nsecondary structures\nFormation of domains\nFormation of final \nprotein monomer1\n2\n3\nFigure 7.12\nSteps in protein folding (simplified).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   96 24-10-2020   12:07:42"

The \ndominant component of the amyloid plaque that accumulates in AD is amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), an extracellular peptide containing 40\u201342 amino acid \nresidues. X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy demonstrate a characteristic \u03b2-pleated sheet secondary structure in nonbranching \nfibrils. This peptide, when aggregated in a \u03b2-pleated sheet confor-\nmation, is neurotoxic and is the central pathogenic event leading to the cognitive impairment characteristic of the disease. The A \u03b2 that \nis deposited in the brain in AD is derived by enzymic cleavages (by secretases ) from the larger amyloid precursor protein, a single trans-\nmembrane protein expressed on the cell surface in the brain and other tissues (\nFig. 7.13 ). The A \u03b2 peptides aggregate, generating the amyloid \nthat is found in the brain parenchyma and around blood vessels. Most cases of AD are not genetically based, although at least 5% of cases are familial. A second biologic factor involved in the development of AD is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons. A key component of these tangled fibers is an abnormal form (hyperphos-phorylated and insoluble) of the tau ( \u03c4) protein, which, in its healthy \nversion, helps in the assembly of the microtubular structure. The defec-tive \u03c4 appears to block the actions of its normal counterpart. [Note: In \nParkinson disease, amyloid is formed from \u03b1-synuclein protein.] \nB. Prion (proteinaceous infectious particle) diseases\nThe prion protein (PrP) is the causative agent of transmissible spongi-\nform encephalopathies (TSE), including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (popularly called \u201cmad cow\u201d disease). After an extensive series of purification procedures, scientists were surprised to find that the infec-tivity of the agent causing scrapie in sheep was associated with a single protein species that was not complexed with detectable nucleic acid. This infectious protein is designated PrP\nSc (Sc = scrapie). It is highly \nresistant to proteolytic degradation and tends to form insoluble aggre-gates of fibrils, similar to the amyloid found in some other diseases of the brain. A noninfectious form of PrP\nC (C = cellular), encoded by the \nsame gene as the infectious agent, is present in normal mammalian brains on the surface of neurons and glial cells. Thus, PrP\nC is a host \nprotein. No primary structure differences or alternate posttranslational modifications have been found between the normal and the infectious forms of the protein. The key to becoming infectious apparently lies in changes in the three-dimensional conformation of PrP\nC. Research \nhas demonstrated that a number of \u03b1-helices present in noninfectious \nPrPC are replaced by \u03b2-sheets in the infectious form ( Fig. 7.14 ). This \nconformational difference is presumably what confers relative resis-tance to proteolytic degradation of infectious prions and permits them to be distinguished from the normal PrP\nC in infected tissue. The infec-\ntive agent is, thus, an altered version of a normal protein, which acts as a template for converting the normal protein to the pathogenic confor-mation. The TSE are invariably fatal, and no treatment is currently avail-able that can alter this outcome.Figure 7.13\nA\u2013C.  Formation of amyloid plaques found \nin Alzheimer disease (AD).

Medical Perspectives\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia character-\nized by a progressive decline in thinking, behavior and social skills associ-ated with brain degeneration and memory loss. Apparently normal proteins assume abnormal conformations, leading to amyloid plaques and neurofi-brillary tangles which are mostly amyloid \u00df peptides around neurons. The \nmajor aggregating protein is amyloid \u00df peptide and tau protein.\nProtein misfolding is also associated with cerebral beta-amyloid angiop-\nathy, retinal ganglion cell degeneration in glaucoma, sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. \nPrion disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which can present as \ndifficulties in thinking, memory, judgment and personality changes. Prion diseases are protein conformational disorders which can infect both humans and animals. Unlike other disorders of protein misfolding, prion disease is infectious. \nHeat application to curly hairs (which has more disulfide bonds cross-\nlinked to alpha-helices of keratin) can break the disulfide bonds and cause straightening of hair.\nVIII. Chapter Summary\nCentral to understanding protein structure is the concept of the native \nconformation  (Fig. 7.15 ), which is the functional, fully folded protein \nstructure (for example, an active enzyme or structural protein). The unique three-dimensional structure of the native conformation is determined by its primary structure , that is, its amino acid sequence. Interactions between \nthe amino acid side chains guide the folding of the polypeptide chain to form secondary , tertiary , and (sometimes) quaternary  structures, which \ncooperate in stabilizing the native conformation of the protein. In addi-tion, a specialized group of proteins named chaperones  is required for the \nproper folding of many species of proteins. Protein denaturation  results \nin the unfolding and disorganization of the protein\u2019s structure, which are not accompanied by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Denaturation may be reversible or, more commonly, irreversible. Disease can occur when an apparently normal protein assumes a conformation that is cytotoxic, as in the case of Alzheimer disease (AD)  and the transmissible spongi-\nform encephalopathies  (TSE), including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . In \nAD, normal proteins, after abnormal chemical processing, take on a unique conformational state that leads to the formation of neurotoxic amyloid \u03b2 \npeptide  (A\u03b2) assemblies consisting of \u03b2-pleated sheets. In TSE, the infec-\ntive agent is an altered version of a normal prion protein  that acts as a \ntemplate for converting normal protein to the pathogenic conformation.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   98 24-10-2020   12:07:44"

By arranging these fundamental structural elements in different combinations, widely diverse proteins can be constructed that are capable of various specialized functions. This chapter examines the relationship between structure and function for the clinically important globular hemeproteins. Fibrous struc-tural proteins are discussed in Chapter 9.\nII. GLOBULAR HEMEPROTEINS\nHemeproteins are a group of specialized proteins that contain heme as a tightly bound prosthetic group. (See p. 137 for a discussion of pros-thetic groups.) The role of the heme group is dictated by the environment created by the three-dimensional structure of the protein. For example, the heme group of a cytochrome functions as an electron carrier that is alter-nately oxidized and reduced (see p. 166). In contrast, the heme group of the enzyme catalase  is part of the active site of the enzyme that cata-\nlyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide (see p. 253). In hemoglobin and myoglobin, the two most abundant hemeproteins in humans, the heme group serves to reversibly bind oxygen (O\n2).\nA. Heme structure\nHeme is a complex of protoporphyrin IX and ferrous iron (Fe2+), as \nshown in Figure 8.1 . The iron is held in the center of the heme mole-\ncule by bonds to the four nitrogens of the porphyrin ring. The heme Fe\n2+ can form two additional bonds, one on each side of the planar \nporphyrin ring.

(See \nChapter 26.)\nB. Myoglobin structure \nMyoglobin, a hemeprotein is present in heart and skeletal muscle. Myoglobin consists of a single polypeptide chain. It has 153 amino acids. Myoglobin is structurally similar to the individual polypeptide chains of the tetrameric hemoglobin molecule. This homology makes myoglobin a useful model for interpreting some of the more complex properties of hemoglobin.\n 1. \ud835\udec2-Helical content:  Myoglobin is a compact molecule, with ~80% \nof its polypeptide chain folded into eight stretches of \u03b1-helix. These \n\u03b1-helical regions, labeled A to H in \nFigure 8.2A , are terminated either \nby the presence of proline, whose five-membered ring cannot be accommodated in an \u03b1-helix (see p. 91) or by \u03b2-bends and loops \nstabilized by hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (see p. 95). [Note: Ionic bonds are also termed electrostatic interactions or salt bridges.]\n 2. Location of polar and nonpolar amino acid residues:  The inte-\nrior of the globular myoglobin molecule is composed almost entirely of nonpolar amino acids. They are packed closely together, forming a structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between these clustered residues (see p. 95). In contrast, polar amino acids are located almost exclusively on the surface, where they can form hydrogen bonds, both with each other and with water.\n 3. Binding of the heme group:  The heme group of the myoglobin \nmolecule sits in a crevice, which is lined with nonpolar amino acids. Notable exceptions are two histidine residues (see \nFig. 8.2B ). One, \nthe proximal histidine (F8), binds directly to the Fe2+ of heme. The \nsecond, or distal histidine (E7), does not directly interact with the heme group but helps stabilize the binding of O\n2 to Fe2+. Thus, the \nprotein, or globin, portion of myoglobin creates a special microen-vironment for the heme that permits the reversible binding of one oxygen molecule (oxygenation). The simultaneous loss of electrons by Fe\n2+ (oxidation to the ferric [Fe3+] form) occurs only rarely.A B\nHemeCB\nAE\nFG\nHDOxygen\nmolecule\nHeme\nF Helix E HelixProximal\nhistidine(F8)\nDistal\nhistidine(E7)Fe\nFigure 8.2\nA.

Myoglobin functions both as an oxygen reservoir and as an \noxygen carrier that increases the rate of oxygen transport within the muscle cell. In aquatic mammals like seals that remain under water for long periods, PO\n2 of muscles decreases to a \nvery low level leading to release of significant amount of oxygen for the cellular respiration. In humans, the PO\n2 of muscle cells \nhardly goes below a certain level. Hence, even during strenuous exercise the release of oxygen from myoglobin is negligible as oxygen dissociation curve is hyperbolic (\nFigure 8.3 ). However, it \nhas other functions.\nb. Protein part of myoglobin prevents metmyoglobin formation. \nBound oxygen often forms superoxide with iron attached to heme of myoglobin. But because of H-bond that the iron forms with distal histidine of myoglobin, the superoxide is less likely to form metmyoglobin that causes metmyoglobinemia.\nc. Oxymyoglobin detoxifies nitric oxide radicals by following \nreaction:\n NO + oxymyoglobin \u2192 NO\n3\u2212 + metmyoglobin\nd. Deoxymyoglobin prevents reperfusion injury. It occurs on recan-\nalization of blocked coronary arteries following therapy with clot busters in cases of acute myocardial infarction. Restart of oxygen supply makes electron transport chain (ETC) operational but leads to leaking of electrons and formation of free radicals which is harmful. Nitric oxide radical can inhibit ETC and thereby reduce reperfusion injury. Deoxymyoglobin in infarcted myocar-dium can decrease reperfusion injury by forming nitric oxide:\n NO\n2\u2212 + H+ + deoxymyoglobin \u2192 NO + OH\u2212 + metmyoglobin\nC. Hemoglobin structure and function\nHemoglobin is found exclusively in red blood cells (RBC), where its \nmain function is to transport O 2 from the lungs to the capillaries of the \ntissues. Hemoglobin A, the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four polypeptide chains (two \u03b1 chains having 141 amino acids each \nand two \u03b2 chains having 146 amino acids each) held together by \nnoncovalent interactions (\nFig. 8.4 ). Each chain (subunit) has stretches \nof \u03b1-helical structure and a hydrophobic heme-binding pocket similar \nto that described for myoglobin. However, the tetrameric hemoglobin molecule is structurally and functionally more complex than myoglobin. For example, hemoglobin can transport protons (H\n+) and carbon dioxide \n(CO 2) from the tissues to the lungs and can carry four molecules of \nO2 from the lungs to the cells of the body. Furthermore, the oxygen-\nbinding properties of hemoglobin are regulated by interaction with allo-steric effectors (see p. 107).\nObtaining O 2 from the atmosphere solely by diffusion greatly \nlimits the size of organisms. Circulatory systems overcome this, but transport molecules such as hemoglobin are also required because O\n2 is only slightly soluble in aqueous solu-\ntions such as blood.Figure 8.3\nOxygen-dissociation curves for \nmyoglobin and hemoglobin (Hb).\n% Saturation with O2 (Y)\n00\n40 80 120\nP50 = 1 P50 = 26100\nHemoglobinMyoglobinpO2 in\ntissuespO2 in \nlungs\n50\ntion with O\n2\n(Y)\n100\nHemo glo\nnn\nooooobbbbbinnnn\nMyoglobin\npO\n2\n in\ntissues\npO\n2\n in \nlungs\n50The oxygen-dissociation curve for Hb is \nsteepest at the oxygen concentrations that occur in the tissues.

In the T form, the two \u03b1\u03b2 dimers interact through a \nnetwork of ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that constrain the movement of the polypeptide chains. The T conformation is the low-oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin.\n b. R form:  The binding of O\n2 to hemoglobin causes the rupture of \nsome of the polar bonds between the two \u03b1\u03b2 dimers, allowing \nmovement. Specifically, the binding of O 2 to the heme Fe2+ pulls \nthe iron into the plane of the heme ( Fig. 8.6 ). Because the iron \nis also linked to the proximal histidine (F8), the resulting move-ment of the globin chains alters the interface between the \u03b1\u03b2 \ndimers. This leads to a structure called the \u201cR,\u201d or relaxed form (see \nFig. 8.5 ). The R conformation is the high-oxygen-affinity \nform of hemoglobin.\nD. Oxygen binding to myoglobin and hemoglobin\nMyoglobin can bind only one molecule of O 2, because it contains only \none heme group. In contrast, hemoglobin can bind four molecules of O\n2, one at each of its four heme groups. The degree of saturation (Y) \nof these oxygen-binding sites on all myoglobin or hemoglobin mole-cules can vary between zero (all sites are empty) and 100% (all sites are full), as shown in \nFigure 8.3 . [Note: Pulse oximetry is a noninva-\nsive, indirect method of measuring the oxygen saturation of arterial blood based on differences in light absorption by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.]\n 1. Oxygen-dissociation curve:  A plot of Y measured at different \npartial pressures of oxygen (pO\n2) is called the oxygen-disso-\nciation curve. [Note: pO 2 may also be represented as PO 2.] The \ncurves for myoglobin and hemoglobin show important differences (see \nFig. 8.3 ). This graph illustrates that myoglobin has a higher \noxygen affinity at all pO 2 values than does hemoglobin. The partial \npressure of oxygen needed to achieve half saturation of the binding sites (P\n50) is ~1 mm Hg for myoglobin and 26 mm Hg for hemo-\nglobin. The higher the oxygen affinity (that is, the more tightly O 2 \nbinds), the lower the P 50.\n a. Myoglobin:  The oxygen-dissociation curve for myoglobin has \na hyperbolic shape (see Fig. 8.3 ). This reflects the fact that \nmyoglobin reversibly binds a single molecule of O 2. Thus, \noxygenated (MbO 2) and deoxygenated (Mb) myoglobin exist in \na simple equilibrium:\nMb + O 2  MbO 2\n   The equilibrium is shifted to the right or to the left as O 2 is added \nto or removed from the system.

Allosteric effectors\nThe ability of hemoglobin to reversibly bind O 2 is affected by the pO 2, \nthe pH of the environment, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), \nand the availability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). These are collectively called allosteric (\u201cother site\u201d) effectors, because their inter-action at one site on the tetrameric hemoglobin molecule causes struc-tural changes that affect the binding of O\n2 to the heme iron at other sites \non the molecule. [Note: The binding of O 2 to monomeric myoglobin is \nnot influenced by allosteric effectors.]\n 1. Oxygen:  The sigmoidal oxygen-dissociation curve reflects specific \nstructural changes that are initiated at one subunit and transmitted to other subunits in the hemoglobin tetramer. The net effect of this cooperativity is that the affinity of hemoglobin for the last oxygen molecule bound is ~300 times greater than its affinity for the first oxygen molecule bound. Oxygen, then, is an allosteric effector of hemoglobin. It stabilizes the R form.\n a. Loading and unloading oxygen:  The cooperative binding of O\n2 \nallows hemoglobin to deliver more O 2 to the tissues in response \nto relatively small changes in the pO 2. This can be seen in \nFigure 8.3 , which indicates pO 2 in the alveoli of the lung and \nthe capillaries of the tissues. For example, in the lung, oxygen concentration is high, and hemoglobin becomes virtually satu-rated (or \u201cloaded\u201d) with O\n2. In contrast, in the peripheral tissues, \noxyhemoglobin releases (or \u201cunloads\u201d) much of its O 2 for use in \nthe oxidative metabolism of the tissues ( Fig. 8.8 ).\n b. Significance of the sigmoidal oxygen-dissociation curve:  \nThe steep slope of the oxygen-dissociation curve over the range of oxygen concentrations that occur between the lungs and the tissues permits hemoglobin to carry and deliver O\n2 efficiently \nfrom sites of high to sites of low pO 2. A molecule with a hyper-\nbolic oxygen-dissociation curve, such as myoglobin, could not achieve the same degree of O\n2 release within this range of pO 2. \nInstead, it would have maximum affinity for O 2 throughout this \noxygen pressure range and, therefore, would deliver no O 2 to \nthe tissues.\n 2. Bohr effect:  The release of O 2 from hemoglobin is enhanced when \nthe pH is lowered (proton concentration [H+] is increased) or when \nthe hemoglobin is in the presence of an increased pCO 2. Both result \nin decreased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and, therefore, a shift to the right in the oxygen-dissociation curve (\nFig. 8.9 ). Both, then, \nstabilize the T (deoxy) form. This change in oxygen binding is called the Bohr effect. Conversely, raising the pH or lowering the concen-tration of CO\n2 results in a greater oxygen affinity, a shift to the left in \nthe oxygen-dissociation curve, and stabilization of the R (oxy) form.O2\nO2\nO2\nO2Hb\nHb\nHb\nHb\nHbO2 O2\nO2 O2O2O2\nO2 O2\nO2\nO2Increasing\naffinity\nfor\nO2\nFigure 8.7\nHemoglobin (Hb) binds successive \nmolecules of oxygen (O 2) with increasing \naffinity.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   107 24-10-2020   12:07:48"

Source of the protons that lower pH:  The concentration of \nboth H+ and CO 2 in the capillaries of metabolically active tissues \nis higher than that observed in alveolar capillaries of the lungs, where CO\n2 is released into the expired air. In the tissues, CO 2 \nis converted by zinc-containing carbonic anhydrase  to carbonic \nacid:\nCO 2 + H 2O  H 2CO 3\n   which spontaneously loses a H+, becoming bicarbonate (the \nmajor blood buffer):\nH2CO 3  HCO 3\u2013 + H+\n   The H+ produced by this pair of reactions contributes to the \nlowering of pH. This differential pH gradient (that is, lungs having a higher pH and tissues a lower pH) favors the unloading of O\n2 in the peripheral tissues and the loading of O 2 in the lung. \nThus, the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin molecule responds to small shifts in pH between the lungs and oxygen-consuming tissues, making hemoglobin a more efficient transporter of O\n2.\n b. Mechanism of the Bohr effect:  The Bohr effect reflects the \nfact that the deoxy form of hemoglobin has a greater affinity for H\n+ than does oxyhemoglobin. This is caused by ionizable \ngroups such as specific histidine side chains that have a higher pK\na (see p. 80) in deoxyhemoglobin than in oxyhemoglobin. \nTherefore, an increase in the concentration of H+ (resulting in \na decrease in pH) causes these groups to become protonated (charged) and able to form ionic bonds (salt bridges). These bonds preferentially stabilize the deoxy form of hemoglobin, producing a decrease in oxygen affinity. [Note: Hemoglobin, then, is an important blood buffer.]\n   The Bohr effect can be represented schematically as:\nHbO\n2 + H+\nOxyhemoglobin  HbH + O 2\nDeoxyhemoglobin\n   where an increase in H+ (or a lower pO 2) shifts the equilibrium \nto the right (favoring deoxyhemoglobin), whereas an increase in pO\n2 (or a decrease in H+) shifts the equilibrium to the left.\n 3. 2,3-BPG effect on oxygen affinity:  2,3-BPG is an important regu-\nlator of the binding of O 2 to hemoglobin. It is the most abundant \norganic phosphate in the RBC, where its concentration is approxi-mately that of hemoglobin. 2,3-BPG is synthesized from an interme-diate of the glycolytic pathway (\nFig. 8.10 ; see p. 197 for a discussion \nof 2,3-BPG synthesis in glycolysis).\n a. 2,3-BPG binding to deoxyhemoglobin:  2,3-BPG decreases the \noxygen affinity of hemoglobin by binding to deoxyhemoglobin but not to oxyhemoglobin.

Globular Hemeproteins 109\n b. 2,3-BPG binding site:  One molecule of 2,3-BPG binds to a \npocket, formed by the two \u03b2-globin chains, in the center of the \ndeoxyhemoglobin tetramer ( Fig. 8.11 ). This pocket contains \nseveral positively charged amino acids that form ionic bonds with the negatively charged phosphate groups of 2,3-BPG. [Note: Replacement of one of these amino acids can result in hemoglobin variants with abnormally high oxygen affinity that may be compensated for by increased RBC production (eryth-rocytosis).] Oxygenation of hemoglobin narrows the pocket and causes 2,3-BPG to be released.\n c. Oxygen-dissociation curve shift:  Hemoglobin from which \n2,3-BPG has been removed has high oxygen affinity. However, as seen in the RBC, the presence of 2,3-BPG significantly reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, shifting the oxygen-dissociation curve to the right (\nFig. 8.12 ). This reduced affinity \nenables hemoglobin to release O 2 efficiently at the partial pres-\nsures found in the tissues.\n d. 2,3-BPG levels in chronic hypoxia or anemia:  The concen-\ntration of 2,3-BPG in the RBC increases in response to chronic hypoxia, such as that observed in chronic obstructive pulmo-nary disease (COPD) like emphysema, or at high altitudes during acclimatization, where circulating hemoglobin may have difficulty receiving sufficient O\n2. Intracellular levels of 2,3-BPG \nare also elevated in chronic anemia, in which fewer than normal RBC are available to supply the body\u2019s oxygen needs. Elevated 2,3-BPG levels lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, permitting greater unloading of O\n2 in the capillaries of tissues \n(see Fig. 8.12 ).\n e. 2,3-BPG in transfused blood:  2,3-BPG is essential for the \nnormal oxygen transport function of hemoglobin. However, storing blood in the currently available media results in the gradual depletion of 2,3-BPG. Consequently, stored blood displays an abnormally high oxygen affinity and fails to unload its bound O\n2 properly in the tissues. Thus, hemoglobin defi-\ncient in 2,3-BPG acts as an oxygen \u201ctrap\u201d rather than as an oxygen delivery system. Transfused RBC are able to restore their depleted supplies of 2,3-BPG in 6\u201324 hours. However, severely ill patients may be compromised if transfused with large quantities of such 2,3-BPG\u2013depleted blood. Stored blood, therefore, is treated with a \u201crejuvenation\u201d solution that rapidly restores 2,3-BPG. [Note: Rejuvenation also restores ATP lost during storage.]\n 4. CO\n2 binding:  Most of the CO 2 produced in metabolism is hydrated \nand transported as bicarbonate ion (see Fig. 6.12, p. 83). However, some CO\n2 is carried as carbamate bound to the terminal amino \ngroups of hemoglobin (forming carbaminohemoglobin as shown in \nFig. 8.8 ), which can be represented schematically as follows:\nHb \u2013 NH 2 + CO 2  Hb \u2013 NH 2 \u2013 COO\u2013 + H+\n   The binding of CO 2 stabilizes the T, or deoxy, form of hemoglobin, \nresulting in a decrease in its oxygen affinity and a right shift in the oxygen-dissociation curve.

When CO binds to one or more of the four heme sites, hemoglobin shifts to the R conformation, causing the remaining heme sites to bind O\n2 with high affinity. This shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to \nthe left and changes the normal sigmoidal shape toward a hyper-bola. As a result, the affected hemoglobin is unable to release O\n2 \nto the tissues ( Fig. 8.13 ). [Note: The affinity of hemoglobin for CO is \n220 times greater than for O 2. Consequently, even minute concen-\ntrations of CO in the environment can produce toxic concentra-tions of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood. For example, increased levels of CO are found in the blood of tobacco smokers. CO toxicity appears to result from a combination of tissue hypoxia and direct CO-mediated damage at the cellular level.] CO poisoning is treated with 100% O\n2 at high pressure (hyperbaric oxygen therapy), which \nfacilitates the dissociation of CO from the hemoglobin. [Note: CO inhibits Complex IV of the electron transport chain (see p. 166).] In addition to O\n2, CO 2, and CO, nitric oxide gas (NO) also is carried by \nhemoglobin. NO is a potent vasodilator (see p. 256). It can be taken up (salvaged) or released from RBC, thereby modulating NO avail-ability and influencing vessel diameter.\nF. Minor hemoglobins\nIt is important to remember that human hemoglobin A (HbA) is just one member of a functionally and structurally related family of proteins, the hemoglobins (\nFig. 8.14 ). Each of these oxygen-carrying proteins is a \ntetramer, composed of two \u03b1-globin (or \u03b1-like) polypeptides and two \n\u03b2-globin (or \u03b2-like) polypeptides. Certain hemoglobins, such as HbF , are \nnormally synthesized only during fetal development, whereas others, such as HbA\n2, are synthesized in the adult, although at low levels \ncompared with HbA. HbA can also become modified by the covalent addition of a hexose (see 3. below).\n 1. Fetal hemoglobin:  HbF is a tetramer consisting of two \u03b1 chains iden-\ntical to those found in HbA, plus two \u03b3 chains ( \u03b1\n2\u03b32; see Fig. 8.14 ). \nThe \u03b3 chains are members of the \u03b2-globin gene family (see p. 112).\n a. HbF synthesis during development:  In the first month after \nconception, embryonic hemoglobins such as Hb Gower 1, composed of two \u03b1-like zeta ( \u03b6) chains and two \u03b2-like epsilon ( \u03b5) \nchains ( \u03b6\n2\u03b52), are synthesized by the embryonic yolk sac. In the \nfifth week of gestation, the site of globin synthesis shifts, first to the liver and then to the marrow, and the primary product is HbF . HbF is the major hemoglobin found in the fetus and newborn, accounting for ~60% of the total hemoglobin in the RBC during the last months of fetal life (\nFig. 8.15 ). HbA synthesis starts in \nthe bone marrow at about the eighth month of pregnancy and gradually replaces HbF . \nFigure 8.15  shows the relative produc-\ntion of each type of hemoglobin chain during fetal and post-natal life. [Note: HbF represents <2% of the hemoglobin in most adults and is concentrated in RBC known as F cells.]\n b. 2,3-BPG binding to HbF:  Under physiologic conditions, HbF \nhas a higher oxygen affinity than does HbA as a result of HbF only weakly binding 2,3-BPG.

Globin Gene Organization 111\n2,3-BPG serves to reduce the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, \nthe weaker interaction between 2,3-BPG and HbF results in a higher oxygen affinity for HbF relative to HbA. This is an impor-tant factor (besides the difference in PO\n2 between maternal \nand fetal blood) for transfer of oxygen from maternal blood that contains HbA to fetal blood that contains HbF . In contrast, if both HbA and HbF are stripped of their 2,3-BPG, they then have a similar oxygen affinity. So, the higher oxygen affinity of HbF facilitates the transfer of O\n2 from the maternal circulation across \nthe placenta to the RBC of the fetus.\n 2. Hemoglobin A 2: HbA 2 is a minor component of normal adult hemo-\nglobin, first appearing shortly before birth and, ultimately, consti-tuting ~2% of the total hemoglobin. It is composed of two \u03b1-globin \nchains and two \u03b4-globin chains ( \u03b1\n2\u03b42; see Fig. 8.14 ).\nHemoglobin A 1c\nUnder physiologic conditions, HbA is slowly glycated (nonen-\nzymically condensed with a hexose), the extent of glyca-tion being dependent on the plasma concentration of the hexose. The most abundant form of glycated hemoglobin is HbA\n1c. It has glucose residues attached predominantly to \nthe amino groups of the N-terminal valines of the \u03b2-globin \nchains ( Fig. 8.16 ). Increased amounts of HbA 1c are found in \nRBC of patients with diabetes mellitus, because their HbA has contact with higher glucose concentrations during the 120-day lifetime of these cells. (See p. 281 for a discussion of the use of HbA\n1c levels in assessing average blood glucose \nlevels in patients with diabetes.)\nIII. GLOBIN GENE ORGANIZATION\nTo understand diseases resulting from genetic alterations in the structure \nor synthesis of hemoglobin, it is necessary to grasp how the hemoglobin genes, which direct the synthesis of the different globin chains, are struc-turally organized into gene families and also how they are expressed.\nA. \u03b1-Gene family\nThe genes coding for the \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin subunits of the hemo-\nglobin chains occur in two separate gene clusters (or families) located on two different chromosomes (\nFig. 8.17 ). The \u03b1-gene cluster on chromo-\nsome 16 contains two genes for the \u03b1-globin chains. It also contains the \n\u03b6 gene that is expressed early in development as an \u03b1-globin-like compo-\nnent of embryonic hemoglobin. [Note: Globin gene families also contain globin-like genes that are not expressed, that is, their genetic information is not used to produce globin chains. These are called pseudogenes.]\nB. \u03b2-Gene family\nA single gene for the \u03b2-globin chain is located on chromosome 11 (see \nFig. 8.17 ). There are an additional four \u03b2-globin-like genes: the \u03b5 gene \n(which, like the \u03b6 gene, is expressed early in embryonic development), \ntwo \u03b3 genes (G \u03b3 and A \u03b3 that are expressed in HbF), and the \u03b4 gene that \ncodes for the globin chain found in the minor adult hemoglobin HbA 2.Months before and after birthPercentage of total globin chains\n\u20139 \u20136 \u20133 3 6 90255002550\na\nb\ndegza-Globin-\nlike chains\nb-Globin-\nlike chainsTime of \nbirth\n0\nFigure 8.15\nDevelopmental changes in globin \nproduction.\nCH2OHHCOHHCH\nHCOHHOCHCONH NHNH 2 NH 2\nCH2OHHCOHHCO\nHCOHHOCHHCOH\nCH2OHHCOHHCH\nHCOHHOCHCOGlucose\nHemoglobin A1cHemoglobin A\nFigure 8.16\nNonenzymatic addition of glucose to \nhemoglobin.

            "Text": "112 8. Globular Proteins\nC. Steps in globin chain synthesis\nExpression of a globin gene begins in the nucleus of RBC precursors, \nwhere the DNA sequence encoding the gene is transcribed. The ribonu-cleic acid (RNA) produced by transcription is actually a precursor of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is used as a template for the synthesis of a globin chain. Before it can serve this function, two noncoding stretches of RNA (introns) must be removed from the mRNA precursor sequence and the remaining three fragments (exons) joined in a linear manner. The resulting mature mRNA enters the cytosol, where its genetic informa-tion is translated, producing a globin chain. (A summary of this process is shown in \nFigure 8.18 . A more detailed description of gene expression \nis presented in Chapter 38.)\nIV. HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES\nHemoglobinopathies are defined as a group of genetic disorders caused by production of a structurally abnormal hemoglobin molecule, synthesis of insufficient quantities of normal hemoglobin, or, rarely, both. Sickle cell anemia (HbS), hemoglobin C disease (HbC), hemoglobin SC disease (HbS + HbC = HbSC), and the thalassemias are representative hemoglo-binopathies that can have severe clinical consequences. The first three conditions result from production of hemoglobin with an altered amino acid sequence (qualitative hemoglobinopathy), whereas the thalassemias are caused by decreased production of normal hemoglobin (quantitative hemoglobinopathy).\nA. Sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin S disease)\nSickle cell anemia, the most common of the RBC sickling diseases, is a genetic disorder caused by a single nucleotide substitution (a point muta-tion, see p. 635) in the gene for \u03b2-globin. It is the most common inher-\nited blood disorder in the United States, affecting 50,000 Americans. It occurs primarily in the African American population, affecting 1 in 500 newborn African American infants. Sickle cell anemia is an auto-somal-recessive disorder. It occurs in individuals who have inherited two mutant genes (one from each parent) that code for synthesis of the \u03b2 chains of the globin molecules. [Note: The mutant \u03b2-globin chain \nis designated \u03b2\nS, and the resulting hemoglobin, \u03b12\u03b2S2, is referred to as \nHbS.] An infant does not begin showing symptoms of the disease until sufficient HbF has been replaced by HbS so that sickling can occur (see p. 115).

Hemoglobinopathies 113\n(\u201ccrises\u201d), chronic hemolytic anemia with associated hyperbilirubinemia \n(see p. 422), and increased susceptibility to infections, usually begin-ning in infancy. [Note: The lifetime of a RBC in sickle cell anemia is <20 days, compared with 120 days for normal RBC, hence, the anemia.] Other symptoms include acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic and renal dysfunction, and bone changes due to marrow hyperplasia. Life expectancy is reduced. Heterozygotes, representing 1 in 12 African Americans, have one normal and one sickle cell gene. The blood cells of such heterozygotes contain both HbS and HbA, and these individ-uals have sickle cell trait. They usually do not show clinical symptoms (but may under conditions of extreme physical exertion with dehydra-tion) and can have a normal life span.\n 1. Amino acid substitution in HbS \ud835\udec3 chains:  A molecule of HbS \ncontains two normal \u03b1-globin chains and two mutant \u03b2-globin \nchains ( \u03b2\nS), in which glutamate at position six has been replaced \nwith valine ( Fig. 8.19 ). Therefore, during electrophoresis at alkaline \npH, HbS migrates more slowly toward the anode (positive electrode) than does HbA (\nFig. 8.20 ). This altered mobility of HbS is a result \nof the absence of the negatively charged glutamate residues in the two \u03b2 chains, thereby rendering HbS less negative than HbA. [Note: \nElectrophoresis of hemoglobin obtained from lysed RBC is routinely used in the diagnosis of sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia (or, sickle cell disease). DNA analysis also is used (see p. 680).]\n 2. Sickling and tissue anoxia:  The replacement of the charged gluta-\nmate with the nonpolar valine forms a protrusion on the \u03b2 chain that \nfits into a complementary site on the \u03b2 chain of another hemoglobin \nmolecule in the cell (\nFig. 8.21 ). At low oxygen tension, deoxyhemo-\nglobin S polymerizes inside the RBC, forming a network of insoluble fibrous polymers that stiffen and distort the cell, producing rigid, misshapen RBC. Such sickled cells frequently block the flow of blood in the narrow capillaries. This interruption in the supply of O\n2 \nleads to localized anoxia (oxygen deprivation) in the tissue, causing pain and eventually ischemic death (infarction) of cells in the vicinity of the blockage. The anoxia also leads to an increase in deoxygen-ated HbS. [Note: The mean diameter of RBC is 7.5 \u03bcm, whereas \nthat of the microvasculature is 3\u20134 \u03bcm. Compared to normal RBC, \nsickled cells have a decreased ability to deform and an increased tendency to adhere to vessel walls. This makes moving through small vessels difficult, thereby causing microvascular occlusion.]\n 3. Variables that increase sickling:  The extent of sickling and, there-\nfore, the severity of disease are enhanced by any variable that increases the proportion of HbS in the deoxy state (that is, reduces the oxygen affinity of HbS). These variables include decreased pO\n2, \nincreased pCO 2, decreased pH, dehydration, and an increased \nconcentration of 2,3-BPG in RBC.\n 4. Treatment:  Therapy involves adequate hydration, analgesics, \naggressive antibiotic therapy if infection is present, and transfu-sions in patients at high risk for fatal occlusion of blood vessels. Intermittent transfusions with packed RBC reduce the risk of stroke, but the benefits must be weighed against the complications of transfusion, which include iron overload that can result in hemosid-erosis (see p. 559), bloodborne infections, and immunologic compli-cations.

This leads to decreased frequency of painful crises and reduces mortality. Stem cell transplantation is possible. [Note: The morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell anemia has led to its inclusion in newborn screening panels to allow prophylactic antibiotic therapy to begin soon after the birth of an affected child.]\n 5. Possible selective advantage of the heterozygous state:  The \nhigh frequency of the \u03b2\nS mutation among black Africans, despite its \ndamaging effects in the homozygous state, suggests that a selec-tive advantage exists for heterozygous individuals. For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell gene are less susceptible to the severe malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This organism spends an obligatory part of its life cycle in the RBC. One theory is that because these cells in individuals heterozygous for HbS, like those in homozygotes, have a shorter life span than normal, the parasite cannot complete the intracellular stage of its development. This may provide a selective advantage to heterozy-gotes living in regions where malaria is a major cause of death. For example, in Africa, the geographic distribution of sickle cell anemia is similar to that of malaria.\nB. Hemoglobin C disease\nLike HbS, HbC is a hemoglobin variant that has a single amino acid substitution in the sixth position of the \u03b2-globin chain (see \nFig. 8.19 ). In \nHbC, however, a lysine is substituted for the glutamate (as compared with a valine substitution in HbS). [Note: This substitution causes HbC to move more slowly toward the anode than HbA or HbS does (see \nFig. 8.20 ).] Rare patients homozygous for HbC generally have a rela-\ntively mild, chronic hemolytic anemia. They do not suffer from infarctive crises, and no specific therapy is required.\nC. Hemoglobin SC disease\nHbSC disease is another of the RBC sickling diseases. In this disease, some \u03b2-globin chains have the sickle cell mutation, whereas other \n\u03b2-globin chains carry the mutation found in HbC disease. [Note: \nPatients with HbSC disease are doubly heterozygous. They are called compound heterozygotes because both of their \u03b2-globin genes are \nabnormal, although different from each other.] Hemoglobin levels tend to be higher in HbSC disease than in sickle cell anemia and may even be at the low end of the normal range. The clinical course of adults with HbSC anemia differs from that of sickle cell anemia in that symptoms such as painful crises are less frequent and less severe. However, there is significant clinical variability.\nD. Methemoglobinemias\nOxidation of the heme iron in hemoglobin from Fe2+ to Fe3+ produces \nmethemoglobin, which cannot bind O 2. This oxidation may be acquired \nand caused by the action of certain drugs, such as nitrates, or endog-enous products such as reactive oxygen species (see Chapter 47). The oxidation may also result from congenital defects, for example, a deficiency of NADH-cytochrome b\n5 reductase  (also called NADH-\nmethemoglobin reductase ), the enzyme responsible for the conversion \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   114 24-10-2020   12:07:53"

The methemoglobinemias are characterized \nby \u201cchocolate cyanosis\u201d (a blue coloration of the skin and mucous membranes and brown-colored blood) as a result of the dark-colored methemoglobin. Symptoms are related to the degree of tissue hypoxia and include anxiety, headache, and dyspnea. In rare cases, coma and death can occur. Treatment is with methylene blue, which is oxidized as Fe\n3+ is reduced.\nE. Thalassemias\nThe thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic diseases in which an imbal-ance occurs in the synthesis of globin chains. As a group, they are the most common single-gene disorders in humans. Normally, synthesis of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin chains is coordinated, so that each \u03b1-globin chain \nhas a \u03b2-globin chain partner. This leads to the formation of \u03b1\n2\u03b22 (HbA). \nIn the thalassemias, the synthesis of either the \u03b1- or the \u03b2-globin chain \nis defective, and hemoglobin concentration is reduced. A thalassemia can be caused by a variety of mutations, including entire gene dele-tions, or substitutions or deletions of one of many nucleotides in the DNA. [Note: Each thalassemia can be classified as either a disorder in which no globin chains are produced ( \u03b1\n0- or \u03b20-thalassemia), or one \nin which some chains are synthesized but at a reduced level ( \u03b1+- or \n\u03b2+-thalassemia).]\n 1. \ud835\udec3-Thalassemias:  In these disorders, synthesis of \u03b2-globin chains \nis decreased or absent, typically as a result of point mutations that affect the production of functional mRNA. However, \u03b1-globin \nchain synthesis is normal.

Because the \u03b2-globin gene is not expressed \nuntil late in prenatal development, the physical manifestations of \u03b2-thalassemias appear only several months after birth. Those indi-\nviduals with \u03b2-thalassemia minor make some \u03b2 chains and usually \ndo not require specific treatment. However, those infants born with \u03b2-thalassemia major are seemingly healthy at birth but become \nseverely anemic, usually during the first or second year of life, due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Skeletal changes as a result of extramed-ullary hematopoiesis also are seen. These patients require regular transfusions of blood. [Note: Although this treatment is lifesaving, the cumulative effect of the transfusions is iron overload. Use of iron chelation therapy has improved morbidity and mortality.] The only curative option available is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n 2. \ud835\udec2-Thalassemias:  In these disorders, synthesis of \u03b1-globin chains \nis decreased or absent, typically as a result of deletional muta-tions. Because each individual\u2019s genome contains four copies of the \u03b1-globin gene (two on each chromosome 16), there are several \nlevels of \u03b1-globin chain deficiencies (\nFig. 8.24 ). If one of the four \ngenes is defective, the individual is termed a \u201csilent\u201d carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia, because no physical manifestations of the disease \noccur. If two \u03b1-globin genes are defective, the individual is desig-\nnated as having \u03b1-thalassemia trait.

B. Hemoglobin (Hb) \ntetramers formed in \u03b1-thalassemias.VI. Chapter Summary\nHemoglobin A  (HbA), the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four \npolypeptide chains (two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b2 chains, \u03b12\u03b22) held together by \nnoncovalent interactions ( Fig. 8.25 ). The subunits occupy different rela-\ntive positions in deoxyhemoglobin compared with oxyhemoglobin. The deoxy form  of Hb is called the \u201c T,\u201d or taut (tense ), conformation . It has a \nconstrained structure that limits the movement of the polypeptide chains. The T form is the low-oxygen-affinity form  of Hb. The binding of oxygen \n(O\n2) to the heme iron causes rupture of some of the ionic and hydrogen \nbonds and movement of the dimers. This leads to a structure called the \u201cR,\u201d or relaxed , conformation . The R form is the high-oxygen-affinity \nform  of Hb. The oxygen-dissociation curve  for Hb is sigmoidal  in shape \n(in contrast to that of myoglobin , which is hyperbolic ), indicating that \nthe subunits cooperate in binding O\n2. The binding of an oxygen molecule \nat one heme group increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining heme groups in the same Hb molecule ( cooperativity ). Hb\u2019s ability to bind O\n2 \nreversibly is affected by the partial pressure of oxygen ( pO2), the pH of the \nenvironment, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( pCO 2), and the avail-\nability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate  (2,3-BPG ). For example, the release of \nO2 from Hb is enhanced when the pH is lowered or the pCO 2 is increased \n(the Bohr effect ), such as in exercising muscle , and the oxygen-dissoci-\nation curve of Hb is shifted to the right. To cope long-term with the effects V. Medical Perspectives\nNormal levels of hemoglobin in India are 12\u201315 g/dl for women and 13\u201317 g/dl for men. Low levels of hemoglobin are seen in iron-deficiency anemia.\nMutations in hemoglobin chains can cause sickle cell anemia and various \nforms of thalassemia.\nIron overload is a common complication of repeated blood transfusions \ngiven to thalassemia patients. Iron deposition in parenchymal tissues begins within 1 year of starting the regular transfusions. One unit of trans-fused RBCs contains approximately 250 mg of iron, while the body cannot excrete more than 1 mg of iron per day. If a patient receives 25 units per year, 5 grams of iron per year will be accumulated in the absence of chela-tion. The intestinal iron absorption is also increased in these patients.\nHemoglobin also binds to other molecules like nitric oxide (NO). NO dilates \nblood vessels, which reduces blood pressure. Thus, hemoglobin contrib-utes to the regulation of blood pressure by distributing nitric oxide through the blood.\nAfter muscle injury, myoglobin is released quickly due to its low molec-\nular weight and is an early marker of both myocardial infarction and rhabdomyolysis. \nMyoglobinuria in adults is most often due to trauma or muscle necrosis \nbecause of prolonged immobilization. Myoglobinuria in children is often because of viral infections.\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless and colorless gas that is produced \nwhen fuels such as gas, oil, coal, and wood do not burn fully. Smoke from cigarettes also produces CO. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   117 24-10-2020   12:07:56"

            "Text": "120 8. Globular Proteins\nB. How does the patient having HbE usually \npresent? Clinical Case Questions\nAnswer\u2014A:  HbE is due to a mutation in Hb \u03b2 chain gene \nthat leads to replacement of glutamine with lysine at 26th residue of E chain of Hb. HbE is unstable at oxida-\ntive stress situation and at high temperature during fever. A cryptic splice site is formed in RNA formed from this mutated gene causing abnormal RNA processing leading to decreased normally spliced \u00df\nE-mRNA. This leads to \nfeatures of mild \u00df-thalassemia. HbE has a right shift of \noxygen dissociation curve indicating its higher capacity to deliver oxygen to tissues that compensates the reduced oxygenation of tissues due to anemia.\nAnswer\u2014B:  Heterozygotes are normal and go mostly \nunnoticed. Homozygotes have mild anemia and sometimes have delayed puberty associated with less secondary sex characters. Hypochromic microcytic anemia with target cells are seen. Anemia is severe when associated with HbC or \u00df-thalassemia. \nAnswer\u2014C:  In suspected cases of hemoglobinopathies, \nthe diagnostic tests are Hb HPLC or capillary electropho-resis of Hb. In HbE disease, usually the anemia is mild and blood picture is as described above.\nAnswer\u2014A:  Under physiologic conditions, HbA is slowly \nglycated (nonenzymically condensed with a hexose), the extent of glycation being dependent on the plasma concentration of the hexose. The most abundant form of glycated hemoglobin is HbA\n1c. It has glucose resi-\ndues attached predominantly to the amino groups of the N-terminal valines of the \u03b2-globin chains. Increased \namounts of HbA\n1c are found in RBC of patients with \ndiabetes mellitus, because their HbA has contact with higher glucose concentrations during the 120-day lifetime of these cells.8.1. A 19-year-old college girl from northeastern part \nof India studying in Delhi was admitted to a hospital with high-grade fever with mild anemia, no cyanosis but had a just palpable spleen. Blood investigation showed RBCs with Plasmodium vivax. Her Hb level was 9g%, RBCs were micro-cytic and hypochromic, and target cells were found on examination of peripheral blood. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of Hb showed 75% HbA, 15% HbE and 10% HbF . After 2 days, her Hb level dropped to 6g%, but oxygen saturation was 98% and blood transfusion was done. Her fever subsided on 4th day, and on 6th day she was discharged with an advice to take 5 mg of folic acid daily for rest of her life.\nA. What is HbE? Write about its molecular defect.\nC. Write about its laboratory diagnosis.\n8.2. A 56-year-old male subject presented to a doctor\u2019s \nclinic with acute pain of a carbuncle on his right axilla and revealed that he had had carbuncles on three occasions during last 6 months. He had his breakfast before attending the hospital. His glycated hemoglobin was measured to be 12%. After incision and drainage of the carbuncle, the patient was advised to take oral hypogly-cemic drugs for 2 months, analgesic as and when required and antibiotics for 5 days. After 2 months when the patient attended, his glycated hemo-globin was 9%. The dose of his oral hypoglycemic agent was increased. He was advised to take a diabetic diet and to engage in physical exercise regularly.\nA. Define glycated hemoglobin. How is it \nproduced?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Glycated Hb (particularly HbA 1c) is used \nfor both diagnosis and long-term monitoring of diabetes mellitus. Although fasting plasma glucose estimation is the preferred test for screening and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and self-monitoring of glucose for its day-to-day monitoring, HbA\n1c \u22656.5% is also diagnostic of diabetes. \nThe normal level is <5.7%. The levels between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered as prediabetic. It is used to monitor the glycemic control of diabetic patients for last 6\u20138 weeks. It is indicated at least twice in year for well-controlled diabetics and quarterly when therapy is changed or when patient fails to meet the glycemic goal. The therapeutic target for nonpregnant adult diabetic patient is <7%. More stringent control targeting HbA\n1c <6.5% is recommended \nin selective cases (patients without significant hypogly-cemia, having long-life expectance, no cardiovascular disease and no polypharmacy), less stringent criteria of HbA\n1c <8% may be appropriate in patients with a history \nof severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, etc. B.

            "Text": "Study Questions 121\nCorrect answer = A.  HbA accounts for over 90% of the \nhemoglobin in a normal adult. If HbA 1c is included, the \npercentage rises to ~97%. Because 2,3-bisphosphoglyc-erate (2,3-BPG) reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, the weaker interaction between 2,3-BPG and HbF results in a higher oxygen affinity for HbF relative to HbA. HbF consists of \u03b1\n2\u03b32. HbA 1c is a glycated form of HbA, \nformed nonenzymically in red blood cells. HbA 2 is a minor \ncomponent of normal adult hemoglobin, first appearing shortly before birth and rising to adult levels (~2% of the total hemoglobin) by age 6 months.Multiple-Choice Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\n8.1. Which one of the following statements concerning \nthe hemoglobins is correct?\nA. HbA is the most abundant hemoglobin in \nnormal adults.\nB. Fetal blood has a lower affinity for oxygen \nthan does adult blood because HbF has an increased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.\nC. The globin chain composition of HbF is \u03b1\n2\u03b42.\nD. HbA 1c differs from HbA by a single, genetically \ndetermined amino acid substitution.\nE. HbA 2 appears early in fetal life.\nCorrect answer = A.  HbS is significantly less soluble in \nthe deoxygenated form, compared with oxyhemoglobin S. Decreased pH (acidosis) causes the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the right, indicating decreased oxygen affinity (increased delivery). This favors the formation of the deoxy, or taut, form of hemoglobin and can precip-itate a sickle cell crisis. The binding of 2,3-bisphospho-glycerate is increased, because it binds only to the deoxy form of hemoglobin.8.2. Which one of the following statements concerning \nthe ability of acidosis to precipitate a crisis in sickle cell anemia is correct?\nA. Acidosis decreases the solubility of HbS.\nB. Acidosis increases the oxygen affinity of \nhemoglobin.\nC. Acidosis favors the conversion of hemoglobin \nfrom the taut to the relaxed conformation.\nD. Acidosis shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve \nto the left.\nE. Acidosis decreases the ability of 2,3-bisphos-\nphoglycerate to bind to hemoglobin.\nCorrect answer = C.  The binding of oxygen at one heme \ngroup increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining heme groups in the same molecule. A rise in pH results in increased oxygen affinity. Carbon dioxide decreases oxygen affinity because it lowers the pH. Moreover, binding of carbon dioxide to the N-termini stabilizes the taut, deoxy form. Hemoglobin binds one molecule of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Deoxyhemoglobin has a greater affinity for protons than does oxyhemoglobin.8.3. Which one of the following statements concerning \nthe binding of oxygen by hemoglobin is correct?\nA. The Bohr effect results in a lower oxygen \naffinity at higher pH values.\nB. Carbon dioxide increases the oxygen affinity \nof hemoglobin by binding to the C-terminal groups of the polypeptide chains.\nC. The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin increases as \nthe percentage saturation increases.\nD. The hemoglobin tetramer binds four molecules \nof 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.\nE. Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have \nthe same affinity for protons.\nCorrect answer = B.  Substitution of lysine by methionine \ndecreases the ability of negatively charged phosphate groups in 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to bind the \u03b2 subunits of hemoglobin. Because 2,3-BPG decreases \nthe oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, a reduction in 2,3-BPG should result in increased oxygen affinity and decreased oxygen (O2) delivery to tissues. The relaxed form is the high-oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. Increased oxygen affinity (decreased delivery) results in a left shift in the oxygen-dissociation curve. Decreased delivery of O\n2 is \ncompensated for by increased RBC production.8.4. \u03b2-Lysine 82 in HbA is important for the binding \nof 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In Hb Helsinki, this amino acid has been replaced by methionine. Which of the following should be true concerning Hb Helsinki?\nA. It should be stabilized in the taut, rather than \nthe relaxed, form.\nB. It should have increased oxygen affinity and, \nconsequently, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.\nC. Its oxygen-dissociation curve should be shifted \nto the right relative to HbA.\nD. It results in anemia.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   121 24-10-2020   12:07:57"

            "Text": "9 Fibrous Proteins\nI. OVERVIEW\nCollagen and elastin are examples of common, well-characterized fibrous \nproteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that serve structural functions in the body. For example, collagen and elastin are found as components of skin, connective tissue, blood vessel walls, and the sclera and cornea of the eye. Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which is obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary structural elements. This is in contrast to globular proteins (discussed in Chapter 8), whose shapes are the result of complex interactions between secondary, tertiary, and, sometimes, quater-nary structural elements.\nII. COLLAGEN\nCollagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. A typical collagen molecule is a long, rigid structure in which three polypeptides (referred to as \u03b1 chains) are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix \n(\nFig. 9.1 ). Although these molecules are found throughout the body, their \ntypes and organization are dictated by the structural role collagen plays in a particular organ. In some tissues, collagen may be dispersed as a gel that gives support to the structure, as in the ECM or the vitreous humor of the eye. In other tissues, collagen may be bundled in tight, parallel fibers that provide great strength, as in tendons. In the cornea of the eye, collagen is stacked so as to transmit light with a minimum of scattering. Collagen of bone occurs as fibers arranged at an angle to each other so as to resist mechanical shear from any direction.Learning Objectives \nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Describe collagen structure and function\n\u2022 Discuss the synthesis and degradation of collagen and associated \ndiseases\n\u2022 Explain the characteristics of elastin and disorders of elastin degradation\nCollagen\na chain\nFigure 9.1\nTriple-stranded helix of collagen formed \nfrom three \u03b1 chains.

The three polypeptide \u03b1 chains are held together by interchain hydrogen bonds. \nVariations in the amino acid sequence of the \u03b1 chains result in struc-\ntural components that are about the same size (\u20181,000 amino acids long) but with slightly different properties. These \u03b1 chains are combined \nto form the various types of collagen found in the tissues. For example, the most common collagen, type I, contains two chains called \u03b11 and \none chain called \u03b12 (\u03b11\n2\u03b12), whereas type II collagen contains three \u03b11 \nchains ( \u03b113). The collagens can be organized into three groups, based \non their location and functions in the body ( Fig. 9.2 ).\n 1. Fibril-forming collagens:  Types I, II, and III are the fibrillar colla-\ngens and have the rope-like structure described above for a typical collagen molecule. In the electron microscope, these linear poly-mers of fibrils have characteristic banding patterns, reflecting the regular staggered packing of the individual collagen molecules in the fibril (\nFig. 9.3 ). Type I collagen fibers (composed of collagen \nfibrils) are found in supporting elements of high tensile strength (for example, tendons and corneas), whereas fibers formed from type II collagen molecules are restricted to cartilaginous structures. The fibers derived from type III collagen are prevalent in more distensible tissues such as blood vessels.\n 2. Network-forming collagens:  Types IV and VIII form a three-dimen-\nsional mesh, rather than distinct fibrils (\nFig. 9.4 ). For example, \ntype IV molecules assemble into a sheet or meshwork that consti-tutes a major part of basement membranes.ITYPE TISSUE DISTRIBUTION\nIV\nIX\nXIISkin, bone, tendon, \nblood vessels, corneaFibril-forming\nFibril-associated*Network-formingII Cartilage, intervertebral \ndisk, vitreous body\nIII Blood vessels, skin, \nmuscle\nBasement membrane     \nVIII Corneal and vascular \nendothelium\nCartilage\nTendon, ligaments, some \nother tissues\nFigure 9.2\nThe most abundant types of collagen. \n[Note: *Fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices are known as FACIT.]\nLight staining seen in \nregions with no gaps.Collagen fibril\nStaggered arrangement of \ncollagen molecules causes the striated appearance of a negatively stained fibril.\nCollagen molecule\nHeavy staining seen in regions with gaps.\nFigure 9.3\nCollagen fibrils at right have a characteristic banding pattern, reflecting the regularly staggered packing of the \nindividual collagen molecules in the fibril.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   124 24-10-2020   12:07:58"

Collagen 125\nBasement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that \nprovide mechanical support for adjacent cells and function as a semipermeable filtration barrier to macromolecules in organs such as the kidney and the lung.\n 3. Fibril-associated collagens:  Types IX and XII bind to the surface \nof collagen fibrils, linking these fibrils to one another and to other components in the ECM (see \nFig. 9.2 ).\nB. Structure\nUnlike most globular proteins that are folded into compact structures, collagen, a fibrous protein, has an elongated, triple-helical structure that is stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds.\n 1. Amino acid sequence:  Collagen is rich in proline and glycine, both \nof which are important in the formation of the triple-stranded helix. Proline facilitates the formation of the helical conformation of each \u03b1 chain because its ring structure causes \u201ckinks\u201d in the peptide \nchain. [Note: The presence of proline dictates that the helical confor-mation of the \u03b1 chain cannot be an \u03b1 helix (see p. 92).] Glycine, the \nsmallest amino acid, is found in every third position of the polypep-tide chain. It fits into the restricted spaces where the three chains of the helix come together. The glycine residues are part of a repeating sequence, \u2212Gly\u2013X\u2013Y\u2013, where X is frequently proline, and Y is often hydroxyproline (but can be hydroxylysine, \nFig. 9.5 ). Thus, most of \nthe \u03b1 chain can be regarded as a polytripeptide whose sequence \ncan be represented as (\u2212Gly\u2013Pro\u2013Hyp\u2013) 333.\n 2. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine:  Collagen contains hydroxy-\nproline and hydroxylysine, which are nonstandard amino acids (see p. 75) not present in most other proteins. They result from the hydroxylation of some of the proline and lysine residues after their incorporation into polypeptide chains (\nFig. 9.6 ). Therefore, the \nhydroxylation is a posttranslational modification (see p. 645). [Note: Generation of hydroxyproline maximizes formation of interchain hydrogen bonds that stabilize the triple-helical structure.]\n 3. Glycosylation:  The hydroxyl group of the hydroxylysine residues \nof collagen may be enzymatically glycosylated. Most commonly, glucose and galactose are sequentially attached to the polypeptide chain prior to triple-helix formation (\nFig. 9.7 ).\nC. Biosynthesis\nThe polypeptide precursors of the collagen molecule are synthesized in fibroblasts (or in the related osteoblasts of bone and chondroblasts of cartilage). They are enzymically modified and form the triple helix, which gets secreted into the ECM. After additional enzymic modifica-tion, the mature extracellular collagen fibrils aggregate and become cross-linked to form collagen fibers.\n 1. Pro- \ud835\udec2 chain formation:  Collagen is one of many proteins that \nnormally function outside of cells. Like most proteins produced for export, the newly synthesized polypeptide precursors of \u03b1 chains \n(prepro- \u03b1 chains) contain a special amino acid sequence at their \nFigure 9.4\nElectron micrograph of a polygonal \nnetwork formed by association of collagen type IV monomers.\nGly LeuHypGly ProHypGly Ala Hyl\nFigure 9.5\nAmino acid sequence of a portion of the \u03b11 chain of collagen.

This sequence acts as a signal that, in the \nabsence of additional signals, targets the polypeptide being synthe-sized for secretion from the cell. The signal sequence facilitates the binding of ribosomes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and directs the passage of the prepro- \u03b1 chain into the lumen of the \nRER. The signal sequence is rapidly cleaved in the lumen to yield a precursor of collagen called a pro- \u03b1 chain (see \nFig. 9.7 ).\n 2. Hydroxylation:  The pro- \u03b1 chains are processed by a number of \nenzymic steps within the lumen of the RER while the polypeptides are still being synthesized (see \nFig. 9.7 ). Proline and lysine residues \nfound in the Y-position of the \u2013Gly\u2013X\u2013Y\u2013 sequence can be hydrox-ylated to form hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine residues. These hydroxylation reactions require molecular oxygen, ferrous iron (Fe\n2+), and the reducing agent vitamin C (ascorbic acid, see p. 527), \nwithout which the hydroxylating enzymes, prolyl hydroxylase  and \nlysyl hydroxylase , are unable to function (see Fig. 9.6 ). In the case of \nascorbic acid deficiency (and, therefore, a lack of proline and lysine hydroxylation), interchain H-bond formation is impaired, as is forma-tion of a stable triple helix. Additionally, collagen fibrils cannot be cross-linked (see 7. below), greatly decreasing the tensile strength of the assembled fiber. The resulting deficiency disease is known as scurvy. Patients with scurvy often show ecchymoses (bruise-like discolorations) on the limbs as a result of subcutaneous extravasa-tion (leakage) of blood due to capillary fragility (\nFig. 9.8 ).\n 3. Glycosylation:  Some hydroxylysine residues are modified by glyco-\nsylation with glucose or glucosyl-galactose (see Fig. 9.7 ).\n 4. Assembly and secretion:  After hydroxylation and glycosylation, \nthree pro- \u03b1 chains form procollagen, a precursor of collagen that \nhas a central region of triple helix flanked by the nonhelical N- and carboxyl (C)-terminal extensions called propeptides (see \nFig. 9.7 ). \nThe formation of procollagen begins with formation of interchain disulfide bonds between the C-terminal extensions of the pro- \u03b1 \nchains. This brings the three \u03b1 chains into an alignment favorable \nfor triple helix formation. The procollagen molecules move through the Golgi apparatus, where they are packaged in secretory vesicles.

Extracellular cleavage of procollagen molecules:  After their \nrelease, the triple-helical procollagen molecules are cleaved by N- \nand C-procollagen peptidases , which remove the terminal propep-\ntides, producing tropocollagen molecules.\n 6. Collagen fibril formation:  Tropocollagen molecules spontaneously \nassociate to form collagen fibrils. They form an ordered, parallel array, with adjacent collagen molecules arranged in a staggered pattern, each overlapping its neighbor by a length approximately three quarters of a molecule (see \nFig. 9.7 ).\n 7. Cross-link formation:  The fibrillar array of collagen molecules serves \nas a substrate for lysyl oxidase . This copper-containing extracellular \nenzyme oxidatively deaminates some of the lysine and hydroxyly-sine residues in collagen. The reactive aldehydes that result (ally-sine and hydroxyallysine) can spontaneously condense with lysine or hydroxylysine residues in neighboring collagen molecules to form covalent cross-links and, thus, mature collagen fibers (\nFig. 9.9 ). \n[Note: Cross-links can form between two allysine residues.]\nLysyl oxidase  is one of several copper-containing enzymes. \nOthers include ceruloplasmin  (see p. 556), cytochrome c \noxidase  (see p. 166), superoxide dismutase  (see p. 253), and \ntyrosinase  (see p. 406). Disruption in copper homeostasis \ncauses copper deficiency (X-linked Menkes syndrome) or overload (Wilson disease, see p. 556).\nD. Degradation\nNormal collagens are highly stable molecules, having half-lives as \nlong as several years. However, connective tissue is dynamic and is constantly being remodeled, often in response to growth or injury of the tissue. Breakdown of collagen fibers is dependent on the proteolytic action of collagenases , which are part of a large family of matrix metal-\nloproteinases . For type I collagen, the cleavage site is specific, gener-\nating three-quarter and one-quarter length fragments. These fragments are further degraded by other matrix proteinases .\nE. Collagenopathies\nDefects in any one of the many steps in collagen fiber synthesis can \nresult in a genetic disease involving an inability of collagen to form fibers properly and, therefore, an inability to provide tissues with the needed tensile strength normally provided by collagen. More than 1,000 muta-tions have been identified in 23 genes coding for 13 of the collagen types. The following are examples of diseases (collagenopathies) that are the result of defective collagen synthesis.\n 1. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a \nheterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders that result from heritable defects in the metabolism of fibrillar collagen mole-cules.

The classic form of EDS, caused by defects in type V collagen, is characterized by skin extensibility and fragility and joint hypermobility (\nFig. 9.10 ). The vascular form, due to defects in type \nIII collagen, is the most serious form of EDS because it is associ-ated with potentially lethal arterial rupture. [Note: The classic and vascular forms show autosomal-dominant inheritance.] Collagen that contains mutant chains may have altered structure, secretion, or distribution, and it frequently is degraded. [Note: Incorporation of just one mutant chain may result in degradation of the triple helix. This is known as a dominant-negative effect.]\n 2. Osteogenesis imperfecta:  This syndrome, known as \u201cbrittle bone \ndisease,\u201d is a genetic disorder of bone fragility characterized by bones that fracture easily, with minor or no trauma (\nFig. 9.11 ). Over \n80% of cases of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are caused by domi-nant mutations to the genes that encode the \u03b11 or \u03b12 chains in \ntype I collagen. The most common mutations cause the replace-ment of glycine (in \u2013Gly\u2013X\u2013Y\u2013) by amino acids with bulky side chains. The resultant structurally abnormal \u03b1 chains prevent the \nformation of the required triple-helical conformation. Phenotypic severity ranges from mild to lethal. Type I OI, the most common form, is characterized by mild bone fragility, hearing loss, and blue sclerae. Type II, the most severe form, is typically lethal in the peri-natal period as a result of pulmonary complications. In utero frac-tures are seen (see \nFig. 9.11 ). Type III is also a severe form and \nis characterized by multiple fractures at birth, short stature, spinal curvature leading to a humped-back (kyphotic) appearance, and blue sclerae. Dentinogenesis imperfecta, a disorder of tooth devel-opment, may be seen in OI.\nIII. ELASTIN\nIn contrast to collagen, which forms fibers that are tough and have high tensile strength, elastin is a connective tissue fibrous protein with rubber-like properties. Elastic fibers composed of elastin and glycoprotein microfi-brils are found in the lungs, the walls of large arteries, and elastic ligaments. They can be stretched to several times their normal length but recoil to their original shape when the stretching force is relaxed.\nA. Structure\nElastin is an insoluble protein polymer generated from a precursor, tropoelastin, which is a soluble polypeptide composed of \u2018700 amino acids that are primarily small and nonpolar (for example, glycine, alanine, and valine). Elastin is also rich in proline and lysine but contains scant hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Tropoelastin is secreted by the cell into the ECM. There, it interacts with specific glycoprotein microfibrils, such as fibrillin, which function as a scaffold onto which tropoelastin is deposited. Some of the lysyl side chains of the tropoelastin polypep-tides are oxidatively deaminated by lysyl oxidase , forming allysine resi-\ndues. Three of the allysyl side chains plus one unaltered lysyl side chain from the same or neighboring polypeptides form a desmosine cross-link (\nFig. 9.12 ). This produces elastin, an extensively interconnected, \nFigure 9.10\nStretchy skin of classic Ehlers-Danlos \nsyndrome.\nFigure 9.11\nLethal form (type II) of osteogenesis imperfecta in which the fractures appear in utero, as revealed by this radiograph of a stillborn fetus.\nCCC\nCCNCH2CH2CH2CCH\nNH O\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCCN\nHH OH CH2CH2CC\nNHO\nHC H2 CH2C\nHNO\nC\n+\nDesmosine\ncross-link\nFigure 9.12\nDesmosine cross-link unique to elastin.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   129 24-10-2020   12:08:00"

With this disease, abnormal fibrillin protein is incorporated into microfibrils along with normal fibrillin, inhibiting the formation of functional microfibrils. [Note: Patients with Marfan syndrome, OI, or EDS may have blue sclerae due to tissue thinning that allows underlying pigment to show through.]\nB. \u03b11-Antitrypsin in elastin degradation\nBlood and other body fluids contain a protein, \u03b11-antitrypsin (AAT), which \ninhibits a number of proteolytic enzymes (called peptidases , proteases , \nor proteinases ) that hydrolyze and destroy proteins. [Note: The inhib-\nitor was originally named AAT because it inhibits the activity of trypsin , \na proteolytic enzyme synthesized as trypsinogen by the pancreas (see p. 380).] AAT has the important physiologic role of inhibiting neutro-phil elastase , a powerful protease  that is released into the extracellular \nspace and degrades elastin of alveolar walls as well as other struc-tural proteins in a variety of tissues (\nFig. 9.14 ). Most of the AAT found in \nplasma is synthesized and secreted by the liver. Extrahepatic synthesis also occurs.\n 1. \ud835\udec2\n1-Antitrypsin in the lungs:  In the normal lung, the alveoli are \nchronically exposed to low levels of neutrophil elastase  released \nfrom activated and degenerating neutrophils. The proteolytic activity of elastase  can destroy the elastin in alveolar walls if unopposed by \nthe action of AAT, the most important inhibitor of neutrophil elastase  \n(see \nFig. 9.14 ). Because lung tissue cannot regenerate, the destruc-\ntion of the connective tissue of alveolar walls caused by an imbal-ance between the protease  and its inhibitor results in pulmonary \ndisease.\n 2. \ud835\udec2\n1-Antitrypsin deficiency and emphysema:  In the United States, \n\u20182%\u20135% of patients with emphysema are predisposed to the disease by inherited defects in AAT. A number of different mutations in the gene for AAT are known to cause a deficiency of the protein, but one single purine base mutation (GAG to AAG, resulting in the substitu-tion of lysine for glutamic acid at position 342 of the protein) is clini-cally the most widespread and severe. [Note: The mutated protein is termed the Z variant.] The mutation causes the normally monomeric AAT to misfold, polymerize, and aggregate within the RER of hepa-tocytes, resulting in decreased secretion of AAT by the liver. AAT deficiency is, therefore, a misfolded protein disease. Consequently, blood levels of AAT are reduced, decreasing the amount that gets to the lung. The polymer that accumulates in the liver may result in cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). In the United States, the AAT muta-tion is most common in Caucasians of Northern European ancestry. An individual must inherit two abnormal AAT alleles to be at risk for the development of emphysema. In a heterozygote, with one normal and one defective gene, the levels of AAT are sufficient to protect the alveoli from damage.

Medical Perspectives\nScurvy is a very common disease of easy bruisability, hemorrhage, \nbleeding gums, weakness, etc. due to inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C affecting collagen synthesis. It is common in children and elderly population. It is easily treated by dietary modifications and vitamin C supplements.\n\u03b1\n1-antitrypsin deficiency in the lungs is due to inherited defects of \n\u03b11-antitrypsin leading to emphysema. Normally, in alveoli, the neutrophil \nelastase  (released by degenerating neutrophils) is continuously inhibited \nby \u03b11-antitrypsin, thereby protecting the alveoli from permanent damage. \nOsteogenesis imperfecta or brittle bone disease is a genetic disorder of \nbone fragility. Patient gives classical history of fractures that happens with minor or no trauma. Usually, it is diagnosed in infancy.\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder due to heri-\ntable genetic defects causing skin extensibility and joint hypermobility. More severe forms have vascular features also.\nV. Chapter Summary\nCollagen and elastin are structural fibrous proteins of the extracellular matrix (\nFig. 9.15 ). Collagen  contains an abundance of proline , lysine , and \nglycine , the latter occurring at every third position in the primary struc-\nture. It also contains hydroxyproline , hydroxylysine , and glycosylated \nhydroxylysine , each formed by posttranslational modification. Fibrillar \ncollagen has a long, rigid structure, in which three collagen polypep-tide \u03b1 chains are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix  \nstabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds . Diseases of fibrillar collagen \nsynthesis affect bones, joints, skin, and blood vessels. Elastin  is a connec-\ntive tissue protein with rubber-like properties in tissues such as the lung. \u03b1\n1-Antitrypsin  (AAT), produced primarily by the liver, inhibits elastase -\ncatalyzed degradation of elastin in the alveolar walls. A deficiency of AAT increases elastin degradation and can cause emphysema  and, in some \ncases, cirrhosis  of the liver.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   131 24-10-2020   12:08:01"

Add a note on the associated diseases.\nClinical Case Question\nAnswer : The history and clinical signs and symptoms \npoint to a diagnosis of scurvy due to lack of vitamin C. Vitamin C is mostly found in fruits and vegetables. It is essential for the hydroxylation and crosslinking of proline and lysine during biosynthesis of collagen. Deficiency decreases synthesis of collagen type IV which is found in blood vessels as also the basement membrane sepa-rating the epidermis from the dermis. Scurvy results in decreased tensile strength of collagen leading to easy bruisability. Vitamin C deficiency is a product of inad-equate dietary intake as humans lack L-gulonolactone oxidase, the enzyme required for its synthesis. The body store of vitamin C is only 1,500 mg (mainly in leukocytes and adrenal glands), and normal levels are dependent on recent uptake. In scurvy, hemorrhage can occur in almost any organ. Further, bone formation is altered and bones become brittle.\n The patient is advised to go back to a normal diet. \nInitially, ascorbic acid supplements should be given. 9.1.

Bones in affected patients are thin, osteoporotic, often bowed, and extremely prone to fracture. Pulmonary problems are not seen in this child. Individuals with Marfan syndrome have impaired struc-tural integrity of the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system.

OVERVIEW\nVirtually all reactions in the body are mediated by enzymes, which are \nprotein catalysts that increase the rate of reactions without being changed in the overall process. Among the many biologic reactions that are energet-ically possible, enzymes selectively channel reactants (called substrates) into useful pathways. Thus, enzymes direct all metabolic events. This chapter examines the nature of these catalytic molecules and their mech-anisms of action.\nII. NOMENCLATURE\nEach enzyme is assigned two names. The first is its short, recommended name, convenient for everyday use. The second is the more complete systematic name, which is used when an enzyme must be identified without ambiguity.\nA. Recommended name\nMost commonly used enzyme names have the suffix \u201c- ase\u201d attached to \nthe substrate of the reaction (for example, glucosidase  and urease ) or \nto a description of the action performed (for example, lactate dehydro-\ngenase  and adenylyl cyclase ). [Note: Some enzymes retain their original \ntrivial names, which give no hint of the associated enzymic reaction, for example, trypsin  and pepsin .]\nB. Systematic name\nIn the systematic naming system, enzymes are divided into six major \nclasses ( Fig. 10.1 ), each with numerous subgroups. For a given enzyme, Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Classify enzymes\n\u2022 Discuss the mechanism of action of enzymes and factors affecting \nenzyme activity\n\u2022 Explain the types of enzyme inhibition with examples\u2022 Discuss the enzymes used in clinical diagnosis1.

Enzymes\nthe suffix - ase is attached to a fairly complete description of the chem-\nical reaction catalyzed, including the names of all the substrates, for example, lactate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\n+) oxidore-\nductase . [Note: Each enzyme is also assigned a classification number. \nLactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase  is 1.1.1.27.] The systematic names are \nunambiguous and informative but are frequently too cumbersome to be of general use.\nPotentially confusing enzyme nomenclature includes synthe-\ntase (requires ATP), synthase  (no ATP required), phosphatase  \n(uses water to remove a phosphate group), phosphorylase  \n(uses inorganic phosphate to break a bond and generate a phosphorylated product), dehydrogenase  (NAD\n+ or flavin \nadenine dinucleotide [FAD] is an electron acceptor in a redox reaction), oxidase  (oxygen is the acceptor, and oxygen atoms \nare not incorporated into substrate), and oxygenase  (one or \nboth oxygen atoms are incorporated).\nIII. PROPERTIES\nEnzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reac-\ntion and are not consumed during the reaction. [Note: Some ribonucleic acids (RNA) can catalyze reactions that affect phosphodiester and peptide bonds. RNAs with catalytic activity are called ribozymes (see p. 616) and are much less common than protein catalysts.]\nA. Active site\nEnzyme molecules contain a special pocket or cleft called the active site. The active site, formed by folding of the protein, contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis (\nFig. 10.2 ). The substrate binds the enzyme noncovalently, forming an \nenzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a confor-mational change in the enzyme (induced fit model) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to an enzyme\u2013product (EP) complex that subsequently dissociates to enzyme and product.\nB. Efficiency\nEnzyme-catalyzed reactions are highly efficient, proceeding from 103 to \n108 times faster than uncatalyzed reactions. The number of substrate \nmolecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per second is called the turnover number, or k\ncat, and typically is 102\u2013104 s\u22121. [Note: \nkcat is the rate constant for the conversion of ES to E + P (see p. 140).]\nC. Specificity\nEnzymes are highly specific, interacting with one or a few substrates and catalyzing only one type of chemical reaction. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which reactions occur in that cell.\nD. Holoenzymes, apoenzymes, cofactors, and coenzymes\nSome enzymes require nonproteins for enzymic activity.

            "Text": "IV. Mechanism of Enzyme Action 137\nwhereas the enzyme without its nonprotein moiety is termed an apoen-\nzyme and is inactive. If the nonprotein moiety is a metal ion, such as zinc (Zn\n2+) or iron (Fe2+), it is called a cofactor. If it is a small organic \nmolecule, it is termed a coenzyme. Coenzymes that only transiently associate with the enzyme are called cosubstrates. Cosubstrates dissociate from the enzyme in an altered state (NAD\n+ is an example; \nsee p. 199). If the coenzyme is permanently associated with the enzyme and returned to its original form, it is called a prosthetic group (FAD is an example; see p. 208). Coenzymes commonly are derived from vita-mins. For example, NAD\n+ contains niacin, and FAD contains riboflavin \n(see Chapter 32).\nE. Regulation\nEnzyme activity can be regulated, that is, increased or decreased, so that the rate of product formation responds to cellular need.\nF. Location within the cell\nMany enzymes are localized in specific organelles within the cell (\nFig. 10.3 ). Such compartmentalization serves to isolate the reaction \nsubstrate or product from other competing reactions. This provides a favorable environment for the reaction and organizes the thousands of enzymes present in the cell into purposeful pathways.\nIV. MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION\nThe mechanism of enzyme action can be viewed from two different perspec-tives. The first treats catalysis in terms of energy changes that occur during the reaction. That is, enzymes provide an alternate, energetically favor-able reaction pathway different from the uncatalyzed reaction. The second perspective describes how the active site chemically facilitates catalysis.\nA. Energy changes occurring during the reaction\nVirtually all chemical reactions have an energy barrier separating the reactants and the products. This barrier, called the activation energy (E\na), is the energy difference between that of the reactants and a high-\nenergy intermediate, the transition state (T*), which is formed during the conversion of reactant to product. \nFigure 10.4  shows the changes \nin energy during the conversion of a molecule of reactant A to product B as it proceeds through the transition state.\nA  T*  B\n 1. Activation energy:  The peak of energy in Figure 10.4  is the differ-\nence in free energy between the reactant and T*, in which the high-energy, short-lived intermediate is formed during the conversion of reactant to product. Because of the high E\na, the rates of uncata-\nlyzed chemical reactions are often slow.\n 2. Rate of reaction:  For molecules to react, they must contain suffi-\ncient energy to overcome the energy barrier of the transition state. In the absence of an enzyme, only a small proportion of a popula-tion of molecules may possess enough energy to achieve the tran-sition state between reactant and product.

In general, \nthe lower the E a, the more molecules have sufficient energy to pass \nthrough the transition state and, therefore, the faster the rate of the reaction.\n 3. Alternate reaction pathway:  An enzyme allows a reaction to \nproceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower E\na (see Fig. 10.4 ). \nThe enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants (substrates) or products and, therefore, does not change the equi-librium of the reaction (see p. 161). It does, however, accelerate the rate by which equilibrium is reached.\nB. Active site chemistry\nThe active site is not a passive receptacle for binding the substrate but, rather, is a complex molecular machine employing a diversity of chem-ical mechanisms to facilitate the conversion of substrate to product. A number of factors are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of enzymes, including the following examples.\n 1. Transition-state stabilization:  The active site often acts as a flex-\nible molecular template that binds the substrate and initiates its conversion to the transition state, a structure in which the bonds are not like those in the substrate or the product (see T* at the top of the curve in \nFig. 10.4 ). By stabilizing the transition state, the enzyme \ngreatly increases the concentration of the reactive intermediate that can be converted to product and, thus, accelerates the reaction. [Note: The transition state cannot be isolated.]\n 2. Catalysis:  The active site can provide catalytic groups that enhance \nthe probability that the transition state is formed. In some enzymes, these groups can participate in general acid\u2013base catalysis in which amino acid residues provide or accept protons. In other enzymes, catalysis may involve the transient formation of a covalent ES complex. [Note: The mechanism of action of chymotrypsin , an \nenzyme of protein digestion in the intestine, includes general base, general acid, and covalent catalysis. A histidine at the active site of the enzyme gains (general base) and loses (general acid) protons, mediated by the pK of histidine in proteins being close to physio-logic pH. Serine at the active site forms a transient covalent bond with the substrate.]\n 3. Transition-state visualization:  The enzyme-catalyzed conversion of \nsubstrate to product can be visualized as being similar to removing a sweater from an uncooperative infant (\nFig. 10.5 ). The process has \na high E a because the only reasonable strategy for removing the \ngarment (short of ripping it off) requires that the random flailing of the baby results in both arms being fully extended over the head, an unlikely posture. However, we can envision a parent acting as an enzyme, first coming in contact with the baby (forming ES) and then guiding the baby\u2019s arms into an extended, vertical position, analo-gous to the transition state. This posture (conformation) of the baby facilitates the removal of the sweater, forming the disrobed baby, which here represents product.

FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION VELOCITY\nEnzymes can be isolated from cells and their properties studied in a test \ntube (that is, in vitro). Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes func-tion in living cells (that is, in vivo).\nA. Substrate concentration\n 1. Maximal velocity:  The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the \nnumber of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time. Velocity is usually expressed as \u03bcmol of product formed per minute. \nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with substrate concentration until a maximal velocity (V\nmax) is reached ( Fig. 10.6 ). \nThe leveling off of the reaction rate at high substrate concentrations reflects the saturation with substrate of all available binding sites on the enzyme molecules present.\n 2. Shape of the enzyme kinetics curve:  Most enzymes show \nMichaelis-Menten kinetics (see p. 140), in which the plot of initial reaction velocity (v\no) against substrate concentration is hyper-\nbolic (similar in shape to that of the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin; see p. 104). In contrast, allosteric enzymes do not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and show a sigmoidal curve (see \nFig. 10.6 ) that is similar in shape to the oxygen-dissociation curve \nof hemoglobin (see p. 104).\nB. Temperature\n 1. Velocity increase with temperature:  The reaction velocity increases \nwith temperature until a peak velocity is reached ( Fig. 10.7 ). This \nincrease is the result of the increased number of substrate mole-cules having sufficient energy to pass over the energy barrier and form the products of the reaction.\n 2. Velocity decrease with higher temperature:  Further elevation of \nthe temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see \nFig. 10.7 ).\nThe optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between \n35\u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 95) \nat temperatures above 40 \u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found \nin hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70 \u00b0C.\nC. pH\n 1. pH effect on active site ionization:  The concentration of protons \n([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the cata-\nlytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in order to interact. For example, catalytic activity may require that an amino group of the enzyme be in the protonated form (\u2212NH\n3+). \nBecause this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines.VmaxReaction velocity (v o)\n[Substrate]00\n[Substrate]\nax\nEnzymes following Michaelis-\nMenten kinetics show ahyperbolic curve.\nAllosteric enzymes\nshow a sigmoidal curve.\nFigure 10.6\nEffect of substrate concentration on reaction velocity.\nReaction velocity (v o)\nTemperature (\u00baC)20 60 80Heat inactivation\nof enzyme\n40\nFigure 10.7\nEffect of temperature on an enzyme-\ncatalyzed reaction.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   139 24-10-2020   12:08:05"

Enzymes\n 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation:  Extremes of pH can also lead \nto denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalyt-ically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains.\n 3. Variable pH optimum:  The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is \nachieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H\n+] \nat which the enzyme functions in the body. For example, pepsin , \na digestive enzyme in the stomach, is maximally active at pH 2, whereas other enzymes, designed to work at neutral pH, are dena-tured by such an acidic environment (\nFig. 10.8 ).\nVI. MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETICS\nLeonor Michaelis and Maude Menten proposed a simple model that accounts for most of the features of many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this model, the enzyme reversibly combines with its substrate to form an ES complex that subsequently yields product, regenerating the free enzyme. The reaction model, involving one substrate molecule, is represented below:\nE  +  S             ES          E  +  Pk1\nk\u20131k2\n where S is the substrate.\n  E is the enzyme.  ES is the enzyme\u2013substrate complex.  P is the product.  k\n1, k\u22121, and k 2 (or, k cat) are rate constants.\nA. Michaelis-Menten equation\nThe Michaelis-Menten equation describes how reaction velocity varies \nwith substrate concentration:\nvo  = Vmax [S]\nKm + [S]\nwhere  v o = initial reaction velocity\n  V max = maximal velocity = k cat [E]Total\n  K m = Michaelis constant = (k \u22121 + k 2)/k1\n  [S] = substrate concentration\nThe following assumptions are made in deriving the Michaelis-Menten \nrate equation.\n 1. Enzyme and substrate relative concentrations:  The substrate \nconcentration ([S]) is much greater than the concentration of enzyme so that the percentage of total substrate bound by the enzyme at any one time is small.\n 2. Steady-state assumption:  The concentration of the ES complex \ndoes not change with time (the steady-state assumption), that is, the rate of formation of ES is equal to that of the breakdown of ES Reaction velocity (v o)\npH79 35 1 1Pepsin Trypsin Alkaline \nphosphatase\nFigure 10.8\nEffect of pH on enzyme-catalyzed \nreactions.\nVmaxReaction velocity (v o)\n[Substrate]\n[Substrate]\n00\nLarge K m of enzyme 2\nreflects a low affinity of enzyme for the substrate.Km1Enzyme 2Enzyme 1\nKm2\nLarge K\nm\n of e\nreflects a lo w\nof enzyme fo r\nsubstrate.\nK\nm\n1\nK\nm\n2\nSmall K m for enzyme 1\nreflects a high affinity of  enzyme for the substrate.Vmax\n    2\nFigure 10.9\nEffect of substrate concentration on reaction velocities for two enzymes: enzyme 1 with a small Michaelis constant (K\nm) and enzyme 2 with a large \nKm.

In general, an intermediate in a series of \nreactions is said to be in steady state when its rate of synthesis is equal to its rate of degradation.\n 3. Initial velocity:  Initial reaction velocities (v\no) are used in the anal-\nysis of enzyme reactions. This means that the rate of the reaction is measured as soon as enzyme and substrate are mixed. At that time, the concentration of product is very small, and therefore, the rate of the back reaction from product to substrate can be ignored.\nB. Important conclusions\n 1. K m characteristics:  Km, the Michaelis constant, is characteristic of \nan enzyme and its particular substrate and reflects the affinity of the enzyme for that substrate. K\nm is numerically equal to the substrate \nconcentration at which the reaction velocity is equal to one half V\nmax. Km does not vary with enzyme concentration.\n a. Small K m: A numerically small (low) K m reflects a high affinity \nof the enzyme for substrate, because a low concentration of substrate is needed to half-saturate the enzyme\u2014that is, to reach a velocity that is one half V\nmax (Fig. 10.9 ).\n b. Large K m: A numerically large (high) K m reflects a low affinity of \nenzyme for substrate because a high concentration of substrate is needed to half-saturate the enzyme.\n 2. Velocity relationship to enzyme concentration:  The rate of \nthe reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration because [S] is not limiting. For example, if the enzyme concentra-tion is halved, the initial rates of the reaction (v\no) and that of V max are \nreduced to half that of the original.\n 3. Reaction order:  When [S] is much less (<<) than K m, the velocity of \nthe reaction is approximately proportional to the substrate concen-tration (\nFig. 10.10 ). The rate of reaction is then said to be first order \nwith respect to substrate. When [S] is much greater (>>) than K m, \nthe velocity is constant and equal to V max. The rate of reaction is \nthen independent of substrate concentration (the enzyme is satu-rated with substrate) and is said to be zero order with respect to substrate concentration (see \nFig. 10.10 ).\nC. Lineweaver-Burk plot\nWhen v o is plotted against [S], it is not always possible to determine \nwhen V max has been achieved because of the gradual upward slope of \nthe hyperbolic curve at high substrate concentrations. However, if 1/v o \nis plotted versus 1/[S], a straight line is obtained ( Fig. 10.11 ). This plot, \nthe Lineweaver-Burk plot (also called a double-reciprocal plot) can be used to calculate K\nm and V max as well as to determine the mechanism \nof action of enzyme inhibitors.\nThe equation describing the Lineweaver-Burk plot is:\nvo  Vmax [S] Km 1\nVmax 1=+Vmax\n VmaxReaction velocity (v o)\nKm[Substrate]\nAt high concentrations\nof substrate ([S] >> Km), \nthe velocity of the reaction is zero order.

ENZYME INHIBITION\nAny substance that can decrease the velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called an inhibitor. Inhibitors can be reversible or irreversible. Irreversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through covalent bonds. Lead, for example, forms covalent bonds with the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteine in proteins. Ferrochelatase , an enzyme involved in heme synthesis (see \np. 417), is irreversibly inhibited by lead. [Note: An important group of irre-versible inhibitors are the mechanism-based inhibitors that are converted by the enzyme itself to a form that covalently links to the enzyme, thereby inhibiting it. They also are referred to as \u201csuicide\u201d inhibitors.] Reversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through noncovalent bonds and, thus, dilution of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex results in dissociation of the reversibly bound inhibitor and recovery of enzyme activity. The two most commonly encoun-tered types of reversible inhibition are competitive and noncompetitive.\nA. Competitive inhibition\nThis type of inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the same site that the substrate would normally occupy and, therefore, competes with the substrate for that site.\n 1. Effect on V\nmax: The effect of a competitive inhibitor is reversed by \nincreasing the concentration of substrate. At a sufficiently high [S], the reaction velocity reaches the V\nmax observed in the absence of \ninhibitor, that is, V max is unchanged ( Fig. 10.12 ).\n 2. Effect on K m: A competitive inhibitor increases the apparent K m for \na given substrate. This means that, in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, more substrate is needed to achieve one half V\nmax.\n1\nvo\n1\n[S]Competitive\ninhibitor\nNo\ninhibitorVmax\n VmaxReaction velocity (v o)\nKmKm[S]00No\ninhibitor\n(Apparent K m in the presence\nof a competitive inhibitor)1\nVmaxWith competitive\ninhibitor\n1\nv\no\n1\nV\nmax\n[S]\np)Maximal velocity, V max, is \nthe same in the presence of a competitive inhibitor.\nMichaelis constant, K\nm, apparently is increased \nin the presence of a competitive inhibitor. 2\n1\nKm\n1\nKmA B\nFigure 10.12\nA.

Effect on the Lineweaver-Burk plot:  Competitive inhibition shows \na characteristic Lineweaver-Burk plot in which the plots of the inhib-ited and uninhibited reactions intersect on the y axis at 1/V\nmax (Vmax \nis unchanged). The inhibited and uninhibited reactions show different x-axis intercepts, indicating that the apparent K\nm is increased in the \npresence of the competitive inhibitor because \u2212 1/K m moves closer \nto zero from a negative value (see Fig. 10.12 ). [Note: An impor-\ntant group of competitive inhibitors are the transition state analogs, stable molecules that approximate the structure of the transition state, and, therefore, bind the enzyme more tightly than does the substrate.]\n 4. Statin drugs as examples of competitive inhibitors:  This group \nof antihyperlipidemic agents competitively inhibits the rate-limiting (slowest) step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This reaction is catalyzed by hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  (HMG CoA reduc-\ntase;  see p. 344). Statins, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and pravas-\ntatin (Pravachol), are structural analogs of the natural substrate for this enzyme and compete effectively to inhibit HMG CoA reductase . \nBy doing so, they inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis, thereby lowering plasma cholesterol levels (\nFig. 10.13 ).\nB. Noncompetitive inhibition\nThis type of inhibition is recognized by its characteristic effect on V max \n(Fig. 10.14 ). Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor and \nsubstrate bind at different sites on the enzyme. The noncompetitive inhibitor can bind either free enzyme or the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, thereby preventing the reaction from occurring (\nFig. 10.15 ).\n 1. Effect on V max: Noncompetitive inhibition cannot be overcome by \nincreasing the concentration of substrate.

Therefore, the enzyme shows the same K\nm in the presence or absence of the noncompetitive inhib-\nitor, that is, K m is unchanged.\n 3. Effect on Lineweaver-Burk plot:  Noncompetitive inhibition is \nreadily differentiated from competitive inhibition by plotting 1/v o \nversus 1/[S] and noting that the apparent V max decreases in the \npresence of a noncompetitive inhibitor, whereas K m is unchanged \n(see Fig. 10.14 ). [Note: Oxypurinol, a metabolite of the prodrug allo-\npurinol, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase , an enzyme \nof purine degradation (see p. 582).]\nC. Enzyme inhibitors as drugs\nAt least half of the ten most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States act as enzyme inhibitors. For example, the widely prescribed \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin and amoxicillin, act by inhib-\niting enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Drugs may also act by inhibiting extracellular reactions. This is illustrated by angio-\ntensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors. They lower blood pressure \nby blocking plasma ACE that cleaves angiotensin I to form the potent \nvasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. These drugs, which include captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril, cause vasodilation and, therefore, a reduction in blood pressure. Aspirin, a nonprescription drug, irreversibly inhibits prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase  \n(see p. 333).\nVIII. ENZYME REGULATION\nThe regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the K\nm. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in \nreaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic condi-tions are changed.\nA. Allosteric enzymes\nAllosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site. These enzymes are almost always composed of multiple subunits, and the regulatory (allo-steric) site that binds the effector is distinct from the substrate-binding site and may be located on a subunit that is not itself catalytic. Effectors that inhibit enzyme activity are termed negative effectors, whereas those that increase enzyme activity are called positive effectors. Positive and negative effectors can affect the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (K\n0.5), modify the maximal catalytic activity of the enzyme (V max), or both \n(Fig. 10.16 ).

            "Text": "VIII. Enzyme Regulation 145\n 1. Homotropic effectors:  When the substrate itself serves as an \neffector, the effect is said to be homotropic. Most often, an allosteric substrate functions as a positive effector. In such a case, the pres-ence of a substrate molecule at one site on the enzyme enhances the catalytic properties of the other substrate-binding sites. That is, their binding sites exhibit cooperativity. These enzymes show a sigmoidal curve when v\no is plotted against substrate concen-\ntration, as shown in Figure 10.16 . This contrasts with the hyper-\nbolic curve characteristic of enzymes following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as previously discussed. [Note: The concept of coopera-tivity of substrate binding is analogous to the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin (see p. 107).]\n 2. Heterotropic effectors:  The effector may be different from the \nsubstrate, in which case the effect is said to be heterotropic. For example, consider the feedback inhibition shown in \nFigure 10.17 . \nThe enzyme that converts D to E has an allosteric site that binds the end product, G. If the concentration of G increases (for example, because it is not used as rapidly as it is synthesized), the first irre-versible step unique to the pathway is typically inhibited. Feedback inhibition provides the cell with appropriate amounts of a product it needs by regulating the flow of substrate molecules through the pathway that synthesizes that product. Heterotropic effectors are commonly encountered. For example, the glycolytic enzyme phos-\nphofructokinase-1  is allosterically inhibited by citrate, which is not a \nsubstrate for the enzyme (see p. 195).\nB. Covalent modification\nMany enzymes are regulated by covalent modification, most often by the addition or removal of phosphate groups from specific serine, thre-onine, or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Protein phosphorylation is recognized as one of the primary ways in which cellular processes are regulated.\n 1. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation:  Phosphorylation reac-\ntions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called protein kinases  \nthat use ATP as the phosphate donor. Phosphate groups are cleaved from phosphorylated enzymes by the action of phospho-\nprotein phosphatases  (\nFig. 10.18 ).\n 2. Enzyme response to phosphorylation:  Depending on the specific \nenzyme, the phosphorylated form may be more or less active than the unphosphorylated enzyme. For example, hormone-medi-ated phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase  (an enzyme that \ndegrades glycogen) increases activity, whereas phosphorylation of glycogen synthase  (an enzyme that synthesizes glycogen) decreases \nactivity (see p. 234).\nC. Enzyme synthesis\nThe regulatory mechanisms described above modify the activity of existing enzyme molecules. However, cells can also regulate the amount of enzyme present by altering the rate of enzyme degradation or, more typically, the rate of enzyme synthesis. The increase (induc-tion) or decrease (repression) of enzyme synthesis leads to an alteration in the total population of active sites.

For example, elevated levels of insulin as a result of high blood glucose levels cause an increase in the synthesis of key enzymes involved in glucose metab-olism (see p. 200). In contrast, enzymes that are in constant use are usually not regulated by altering the rate of enzyme synthesis. Alterations in enzyme levels as a result of induction or repression of protein synthesis are slow (hours to days), compared with allosteri-cally or covalently regulated changes in enzyme activity, which occur in seconds to minutes. \nFigure 10.19  summarizes the common ways that \nenzyme activity is regulated.\nIX. ENZYMES IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\nPlasma enzymes can be classified into two major groups. First, a relatively small group of enzymes are actively secreted into the blood by certain cell types. For example, the liver secretes zymogens (inactive precursors) of the enzymes involved in blood coagulation. Second, a large number of enzyme species are released from cells during normal cell turnover. These enzymes almost always function intracellularly and have no physiologic use in the plasma. In healthy individuals, the levels of these enzymes are fairly constant and represent a steady state in which the rate of release from damaged cells into the plasma is balanced by an equal rate of removal from the plasma. Increased plasma levels of these enzymes may indicate tissue damage (\nFig. 10.20 ).Substrate availability\nProduct inhibitionAllosteric controlCovalent modificationSynthesis or degradation\n  of enzymeSubstrate\nReaction productPathway end productAnother enzymeHormone or\n  metaboliteChange in velocity (v\no)\nChange in V max and/or K m\nChange in V max and/or K 0.5\nChange in V max and/or K m\nChange in the amount\n  of enzymeImmediate\nImmediateImmediateImmediate to minutesHours to daysREGULATOR EVENT TYPICAL EFFECTOR RESULTS TIME REQUIRED FOR CHANGE\nFigure 10.19\nMechanisms for regulating enzyme activity.

Laboratory \nassays of enzyme activity most often use serum, which is obtained by centrifugation of whole blood after it has been allowed to coagulate. Plasma is a physiologic fluid, whereas serum is prepared in the laboratory.\nA. Plasma enzyme levels in disease states\nMany diseases that cause tissue damage result in an increased release \nof intracellular enzymes into the plasma. The activities of many of these enzymes are routinely determined for diagnostic purposes in diseases of the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. The level of specific enzyme activity in the plasma frequently correlates with the extent of tissue damage. Therefore, determining the degree of eleva-tion of a particular enzyme activity in the plasma is often useful in eval-uating the prognosis for the patient.\nB. Plasma enzymes as diagnostic tools\nSome enzymes show relatively high activity in only one or a few tissues. Therefore, the presence of increased levels of these enzymes in plasma reflects damage to the corresponding tissue. For example, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase  (ALT; see p. 823) is abundant in the liver. \nThe appearance of elevated levels of ALT in plasma signals possible \ndamage to hepatic tissue. [Note: Measurement of ALT is part of the liver \nfunction test panel.] Increases in plasma levels of enzymes with a wide tissue distribution provide a less specific indication of the site of cellular injury and limits their diagnostic value.\nC. Isoenzymes and heart disease\nIsoenzymes (also called isozymes) are enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. However, they do not necessarily have the same phys-ical properties because of genetically determined differences in amino acid sequence. For this reason, isoenzymes may contain different numbers of charged amino acids, which allows electrophoresis (the movement of charged particles in an electric field) to separate them (\nFig. 10.21 ). Different organs commonly contain characteristic propor-\ntions of different isoenzymes. The pattern of isoenzymes found in the plasma may, therefore, serve as a means of identifying the site of tissue damage. For example, the plasma levels of creatine kinase  (CK) are \ncommonly determined in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). They are particularly useful when the electrocardiogram (ECG) is diffi-cult to interpret such as when there have been previous episodes of heart disease.\n 1. Isoenzyme quaternary structure:  Many isoenzymes contain \ndifferent subunits in various combinations. For example, CK occurs \nas three isoenzymes. Each isoenzyme is a dimer composed of two polypeptides (called B and M subunits) associated in one of three combinations: CK1 = BB, CK2 = MB, and CK3 = MM. Each \nCK isoenzyme shows a characteristic electrophoretic mobility (see \nFig. 10.21 ). [Note: Virtually all CK in the brain is the BB isoform, \nwhereas it is MM in skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, about one third is MB with the rest as MM.]\nCK1 CK2 CK3Direction of migrationANODE (+) CATHODE (\u2013)\nNormalOrigin\nMyocardial\ninfarction\nMB\nBB\nO\nMyocar\nCK isozymes are negatively \ncharged and migrate towardthe anode.BBBM\nMM\nMM\nFigure 10.21\nSubunit composition, electrophoretic mobility, and enzyme activity of creatine \nkinase  (CK) isoenzymes.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   147 24-10-2020   12:08:09"

Myocardial muscle is the only tissue that contains >5% of the total CK activity as the CK2 (MB) isoenzyme. Appearance of \nthis hybrid isoenzyme in plasma is virtually specific for infarction of the myocardium. Following an acute MI, CK2 appears in plasma \nwithin 4\u20138 hours following onset of chest pain, reaches a peak of activity at ~24 hours, and returns to baseline after 48\u201372 hours (\nFig. 10.22 ). Troponins T (TnT) and I (TnI) are regulatory proteins \ninvolved in muscle contractility. Cardiac-specific isoforms (cTn) are released into the plasma in response to cardiac damage. They are highly sensitive and specific for damage to cardiac tissue. cTn appear in plasma within 4\u20136 hours after an MI, peak in 24\u201336 hours, and remain elevated for 3\u201310 days.

Enzymes commonly used to diagnose diseases include lactate \ndehydrogenase , AST, creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) for myocardial \ninfarction, and AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , gamma glutamyltrans-\nferase (GGT)  for liver function tests (see Appendix Unit II). Creatine kinase \nisoenzymes (CK-MM) are also used for diagnosis of muscular dystrophies.\nEnzymes are also used in in vitro test kits in labs  for analysis and include \nglucose oxidase (used for estimation of glucose), lipase (used to detect \ntriglyceride levels), urease (used to determine urea levels) and horseradish \nperoxidase (used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   148 24-10-2020   12:08:10"

Chapter Summary\nEnzymes are protein catalysts  that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transi-\ntion state  (Fig. 10.23 ). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the \nactive site , which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site \nbinds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate  (ES) complex . Binding is thought to cause a conformational change \nin the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway  with a lower activa-\ntion energy  (E\na). Because the enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants or products, it does not change \nthe equilibrium of the reaction. Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics , and a plot of the initial reaction velocity  \n(vo) against substrate concentration  ([S]) has a hyperbolic  shape similar to the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin. \nA Lineweaver-Burk  plot of 1/v and 1/[S] allows determination of Vmax (maximal velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant, \nwhich reflects affinity for substrate). Any substance that can decrease the velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called an inhibitor . The two most common types of reversible inhibition are competitive  (which increases  the apparent \nK\nm) and noncompetitive  (which decreases  the apparent V max). In contrast, the multisubunit allosteric enzymes  show a \nsigmoidal curve  similar in shape to the oxygen-dissociation curve of hemoglobin. They typically catalyze the committed \nstep of a pathway. Allosteric enzymes  are regulated by molecules called effectors  that bind noncovalently at a site other \nthan the active site. Effectors can be either positive  (increase enzyme activity) or negative  (decrease enzyme activity). An \nallosteric effector can alter the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (K 0.5), the maximal catalytic activity of the enzyme \n(Vmax), or both. Enzymes can also be regulated by covalent modification  and by changes in the rate of synthesis or \ndegradation. Enzymes have diagnostic and therapeutic value in medicine.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   149 24-10-2020   12:08:10"

Ethanol therapy is recommended when methanol more than 30 ml is ingested. Ethanol and methanol both are substrates for alcohol dehydrogenase  with ethanol having a much lower \nK\nm for the enzyme compared to methanol. This prevents \nthe methanol from being converted to formaldehyde which is highly toxic and not metabolized further. On the other hand, ethanol is converted to the nontoxic acetic acid.10.1. A group of five poor laborers decided to rejoice by \ndrinking as they were just paid their salary after the current project was over. They purchased alcohol from the local village shop. However, within few minutes to hours of drinking the alcohol, they had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, amnesia, drowsiness, dizziness, and blurred vision. They were brought to the local doctor who suspected they had consumed fake spurious liquor. He immediately administered ethanol to them after which four of them started feeling better. They were then sent to the district hospital.\nA. Why did the doctor administer ethanol? \nB. What further treatment is expected to be done \nat the district hospital?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Further treatment, for which the laborers \nare being sent to district hospital, may involve hemodi-alysis.

Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) are cardiac regulatory proteins that control the calcium-mediated interac-tion between actin and myosin. They are more specific for cardiac injury and are elevated for a prolonged time after acute coronary event, making them preferable over creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) measurement. \nUrinary Proteins\nProteins in urine can be plasma proteins (filtered and not reabsorbed by \nkidneys) or from kidney, urinary tract, vagina and prostate. Urinary protein tests can be done qualitatively (commonly done using a reagent strip) or quantitatively. Most quantitative assays are performed on 24-hour urine specimens, which allow for circadian rhythmic changes in excretion at certain times of the day.\nFor spot urine assay, creatinine is also measured, and results are expressed \nas protein/creatinine ratio.\nCerebrospinal Fluid Proteins\nThe reference range for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is 15\u201345 mg/dl.

It is found naturally in eggs, milk and cheese and often added to soft drinks. Phenylalanine must not be taken if a person suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU) in which case a phenylalanine-free diet early in childhood can protect from mental disorders. \nAspartame, a common sweetener used as sugar replacement, contains \nphenylalanine. Tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin is a natural relaxant which reduces anxiety and induces sleep. It is used in the treatment of migraine headaches and controls hyperactivity in children. It is also useful in weight control as it reduces appetite. Tryptophan occurs naturally in chocolates, eggs, oats, milk and cheese. \nCysteine is used in the food industry for production of flavors and as a \nprocessing aid for baking. Cysteine is a popular target for site-directed labeling experiments for biomolecular structure. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), the sodium salt of glutamic acid is used as a food additive and flavor enhancer. Selenocysteine, in which a selenium atom replaces sulfur, is present in several enzymes, such as formate dehydrogenases , glycine \nreductases, and some hydrogenases. HIV-1 encodes a functional seleno-protein, and selenium levels in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are low. Studies have shown that selenium supplementation can delay CD4 decline in HIV-infected patients, thus delaying the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   155 24-10-2020   12:08:11"

            "Text": "Unit III Overview\nCarbohydrates are a source of energy, structural components, intracellular communications, and fuel storage in body. \nThey are divided into simple and complex sugars, and dietary malabsorption and enzymatic deficiencies lead to diseases like lactose intolerance (Chapter 12). Bioenergetics decides whether a particular reaction is possible given the energy shifts, and the electron transport chain participates in trapping the energy released from carbohydrates like glucose into high-energy compounds like ATP (Chapter 11). These high-energy compounds give their energy wherever required to keep the metabolic processes going.\n Metabolic pathways can be anabolic (synthetic) or catabolic (degradative). Carbohydrate metabolism has the anabolic \nprocesses of glycogenesis (storage of excess carbohydrates by forming glycogen [Chapter 16]) and gluconeogenesis (making glucose when there is not enough ingested, like in starvation [Chapter 15). The catabolic processes to release energy from compounds include glycolysis (breakdown of glucose to acetyl-CoA with the release of ATP [Chapter13]), further breakdown of acetyl-CoA via TCA cycle to release more energy (Chapter 14) and glycogenolysis (breakdown of stored glycogen to release energy and glucose [Chapter 16]).\n Further, many special compounds are made in these metabolic processes, e.g., NADPH and ribose-P by PPP \npathway (Chapter 18). Glycosaminoglycans have ability to bind water and form gel-like substance which is the basis of the body\u2019s matrix (Chapter 19). Besides glucose, fructose and galactose also contribute to the energy metabolism and complex molecules like glycosylated proteins (Chapter 17). \n All pathways interact with protein, lipid and other metabolisms in some way or other. The interactions are covered \nin the Unit VI: Integration of Metabolism. Since these pathways are interconnected, derangement in one invariably leads to other consequences (Unit VI).\n Most pathways are under hormonal and energy balance controls with feedback mechanisms and rate-limiting \nsteps to fine tune the process. The rate-limiting step is the slowest step of a pathway with maximum control in form of hormones, coenzymes, cofactors, feedback mechanisms acting at this step. Crossing this step usually means that the pathway will go to completion. A pathway is called a cycle when the initial substrates are regenerated, e.g., acetyl-CoA in TCA cycle. \n The primary healthcare physician must know the normal levels of common analytes like blood glucose and be \nable to interpret derangements (Appendix Unit III) and understand the hormonal control of blood glucose levels. There are few conditions in which gluconeogenesis must happen at an accelerated rate and ketone bodies will appear in urine (Unit VI). The diagnosis of common diseases like Diabetes Mellitus (also see Unit VI) and an understanding of the biochemical basis of acute and chronic complications of Diabetes Mellitus are a must for patient care. Other topics to be understood include G6PD deficiency which can lead to hemolytic anemia (Chapter 18) and glycogen storage disorders (Chapter 16).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   158 24-10-2020   12:08:11"

            "Text": "11Bioenergetics \nand Oxidative Phosphorylation\nI. OVERVIEW\nBioenergetics describes the transfer and utilization of energy in biologic \nsystems. It concerns the initial and final energy states of the reaction components, not the reaction mechanism or how much time it takes for the chemical change to occur. Bioenergetics makes use of a few basic ideas from the field of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy. Because changes in free energy provide a measure of the energetic feasi-bility of a chemical reaction, they allow prediction of whether a reaction or process can take place. In short, bioenergetics predicts if a process is possible, whereas kinetics measures the reaction rate (see p. 136).\nII. FREE ENERGY\nThe direction and extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds are deter-mined by the degree to which two factors change during the reaction. These are enthalpy ( \u0394H, a measure of the change [ \u0394] in heat content of \nthe reactants and products) and entropy ( \u0394S, a measure of the change \nin randomness or disorder of the reactants and products), as shown in \nFigure 11.1 . Neither of these thermodynamic quantities by itself is suffi-\ncient to determine whether a chemical reaction will proceed spontaneously in the direction it is written. However, when combined mathematically (see \nFig. 11.1 ), enthalpy and entropy can be used to define a third quantity, free \nenergy (G), which predicts the direction in which a reaction will spontane-ously proceed.Learning Objectives\nAfter going through this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the factors that makes biochemical reaction spontaneous and \nthermodynamically favorable \n\u2022 Describe the process of ATP biosynthesis by oxidative phosphorylation\u2022 List the inhibitors of ATP biosynthesis by oxidative phosphorylation\u2022 Explain the role of mitochondria in apoptosis and mutation of mito-\nchondrial DNA in pathogenesis of myopathies\n\u0394G = \u0394H   T \u0394S\u0394H: CHANGE IN ENTHALPY  \n\u2022 Heat released or absorbed\n   during a reaction\n\u2022 Does not predict whether a \n   reaction is favorable\n\u0394S: CHANGE IN ENTROPY  \n\u2022 Measure of randomness \n\u2022 Does not predict whether a \n   reaction is favorable\n\u0394\nH: CHAN GE IN ENTHALPY \n\u2022\nHeat released  or abso rbed\n   durin g a reactio n\n\u2022\nDoes not predict whether a \n   reaction is favorable\n\u0394\nG = \n\u0394\nHT\n \u0394\nS\n \u0394\u0394\nG=\n \u0394\nHT\n\u0394\nS\n\u0394G: CHANGE IN FREE ENERGY  \n\u2022 Energy available to do work\n\u2022 Approaches zero as reaction \n   proceeds to equilibrium\n\u2022 Predicts whether a reaction is \n   favorable\nFigure 11.1\nRelationship between changes in free \nenergy (G), enthalpy (H), and entropy (S).

The \nfirst, \u0394G (without the superscript \u201c0\u201d), represents the change in free energy \nand, thus, the direction of a reaction at any specified concentration of prod-ucts and reactants. \u0394G, then, is a variable. This contrasts with the standard \nfree energy change, \u0394G\n0 (with the superscript \u201c0\u201d), which is the energy \nchange when reactants and products are at a concentration of 1 mol/l. [Note: The concentration of protons (H\n+) is assumed to be 10\u22127 mol/l (that \nis, pH = 7). This may be shown by a prime sign ( \u2032), for example, \u0394G0\u2032.] \nAlthough \u0394G0, a constant, represents energy changes at these nonphysio-\nlogic concentrations of reactants and products, it is nonetheless useful in comparing the energy changes of different reactions. Furthermore, \u0394G\n0 can \nreadily be determined from measurement of the equilibrium constant (see p. 161). [Note: This section outlines the uses of \u0394G, and \u0394G\n0 is described \nin D. below.]\nA. \u0394G and reaction direction\nThe sign of \u0394G can be used to predict the direction of a reaction at \nconstant temperature and pressure. Consider the reaction:\nA B\n 1. Negative \u0394G: If \u0394G is negative, then there is a net loss of energy, \nand the reaction goes spontaneously as written (that is, A is converted into B) as shown in \nFigure 11.2A . The reaction is said to \nbe exergonic.\n 2. Positive \u0394G: If \u0394G is positive, then there is a net gain of energy, and \nthe reaction does not go spontaneously from B to A ( Fig. 11.2B ). \nEnergy must be added to the system to make the reaction go from B to A. The reaction is said to be endergonic.\n 3. Zero \u0394G: If \u0394G = 0, then the reaction is in equilibrium. [Note: When \na reaction is proceeding spontaneously (that is, \u0394G is negative), \nthe reaction continues until \u0394G reaches zero and equilibrium is \nestablished.]\nB. \u0394G of the forward and back reactions\nThe free energy of the forward reaction (A \u2192 B) is equal in magnitude \nbut opposite in sign to that of the back reaction (B \u2192 A). For example, \nif \u0394G of the forward reaction is \u22125 kcal/mol, then that of the back reac-\ntion is +5 kcal/mol. [Note: \u0394G can also be expressed in kilojoules per \nmole or kJ/mol (1 kcal = 4.2 kJ).]\nC. \u0394G and reactant and product concentrations\nThe \u0394G of the reaction A \u2192 B depends on the concentration of the reac-\ntant and product. At constant temperature and pressure, the following relationship can be derived:\n[B]\n[A]\u0394G = \u0394G   + RT In0\nwhere \u0394G0 is the standard free energy change (see D. below)\n R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol K) T is the absolute temperature (K)Initial state\nFinal state\nProgress of reactionFree energy (G)A\nChange in\nfree energyof reaction\nInitial stateTransition\nstate\nProgress of reactionFree energy (G)AB\nBFinal stateTransition\nstateB A\nA B(Reactant) (Product)\n\u0394G is positiveA\nB\u0394G is negative\nFigure 11.2\nChange in free energy ( \u0394G) during a \nreaction.

Free Energy Change 161\n  [A] and [B] are the actual concentrations of the reactant and \nproduct\n ln represents the natural logarithm.\nA reaction with a positive \u0394G0 can proceed in the forward direction if \nthe ratio of products to reactants ([B]/[A]) is sufficiently small (that is, the ratio of reactants to products is large) to make \u0394G negative. For \nexample, consider the reaction:\nGlucose 6-phosphate  fructose 6-phosphate\nFigure 11.3A  shows reaction conditions in which the concentration of \nreactant, glucose 6-phosphate, is high compared with the concentra-tion of product, fructose 6-phosphate. This means that the ratio of the product to reactant is small, and RT ln([fructose 6-phosphate]/[glucose 6-phosphate]) is large and negative, causing \u0394G to be negative despite \n\u0394G\n0 being positive. Thus, the reaction can proceed in the forward \ndirection.\nD. Standard free energy change\nThe standard free energy change, \u0394G0, is so called because it is equal \nto the free energy change, \u0394G, under standard conditions (that is, when \nreactants and products are at 1 mol/l concentrations; Fig. 11.3B ). Under \nthese conditions, the natural logarithm of the ratio of products to reac-tants is zero (ln1 = 0), and, therefore, the equation shown at the bottom of the previous page becomes:\n\u0394G = \u0394G0 + 0\n 1. \u0394G0 and reaction direction:  Under standard conditions, \u0394G0 can \nbe used to predict the direction a reaction proceeds because, under these conditions, \u0394G\n0 is equal to \u0394G. However, \u0394G0 cannot predict \nthe direction of a reaction under physiologic conditions because it is composed solely of constants (R, T, and K\neq [see 2. below]) and is \nnot, therefore, altered by changes in product or substrate concen-trations. If \u0394G\n0 is negative, the probability of \u0394G being negative \nis high. Hence such reactions are called thermodynamically favor-able reactions. But many thermodynamically unfavorable reactions where \u0394G is positive do occur in living organisms. In a metabolic \npathway, if A and B are metabolic intermediates and \u0394G\n0 is posi-\ntive for reaction A \u2192B, substance A comes to the system from the \nprevious reaction and B is used up in the subsequent reaction and that make [B] to [A] ratio so low that RT ln[B]/[A] becomes a greater negative integer than \u0394G\n0 making \u0394G of the reaction negative. One \nexample of such reaction in glycolytic pathway is:\n   DHAP \u2192 Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [ \u0394G0 is positive]\n 2. Relationship between \u0394G0 and K eq: In a reaction A  B, a point \nof equilibrium is reached at which no further net chemical change takes place (that is, when A is being converted to B as fast as B is being converted to A). In this state, the ratio of [B] to [A] is constant, regardless of the actual concentrations of the two compounds:\nKeq =[B]eq\n[A]eq\nwhere K eq is the equilibrium constant, and [A] eq and [B] eq are the \nconcentrations of A and B at equilibrium.

As \nlong as the sum of the \u0394Gs of the individual reactions is negative, \nthe pathway can proceed as written, even if some of the individual reactions of the pathway have a positive \u0394G. However, the actual \nrates of the reactions depend on the lowering of activation energies (E\na) by the enzymes that catalyze the reactions (see p. 137).\nIV. ATP: AN ENERGY CARRIER\nReactions or processes that have a large positive \u0394G, such as moving \nions against a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, are made possible by coupling the endergonic movement of ions with a second, spontaneous process with a large negative \u0394G such as the exergonic \nhydrolysis of ATP (see p. 180). [Note: In the absence of enzymes, ATP is a stable molecule because its hydrolysis has a high E\na.] Figure 11.4 shows \na mechanical model of energy coupling. The simplest example of energy coupling in biologic reactions occurs when the energy-requiring and the energy-yielding reactions share a common intermediate.\nA.

[Note: The intermediate may be linked to an enzyme.] Many coupled reactions use ATP to generate a common intermediate. These reactions may involve the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another molecule. Other reactions involve the transfer of phosphate from an energy-rich intermediate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), forming ATP . Thus ATP-ADP cycle is operative in our body that fulfills the need of approximate 80 kg of ATP from approximately 20 g of adenine nucleotide present in a person having 60 kg body weight.\nB. Energy carried by ATP\nATP consists of a molecule of adenosine (adenine + ribose) to which three phosphate groups are attached (\nFig. 11.5 ). Removal of one \nphosphate produces ADP , and removal of two phosphates produces adenosine monophosphate (AMP). For ATP , the \u0394G\n0 of hydrolysis is \napproximately \u20137.3 kcal/mol for each of the two terminal phosphate groups. Because of this large negative \u0394G\n0 of hydrolysis, ATP is called \na high-energy phosphate compound. Any phosphorylated compound whose \u0394G\n0 of hydrolysis is less than or equal to that of ATP is consid-\nered as high-energy phosphates, because of their high phosphoryl group transfer potential. As ATP is abundant in cells among all high-energy phosphates, it is selected by nature as currency of energy. [Note: Adenine nucleotides are interconverted (2 ADP \n ATP + AMP) \nby adenylate kinase . This enzyme plays a crucial role in energy homeo-\nstasis of cells by three different ways: (a) By producing AMP , it stim-ulates ATP-producing metabolic pathways as AMP act as allosteric stimulator of those pathways; (b) In severely ischemic tissues where ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation stops, the cells try to produce one ATP from two ADP molecules by using above reaction and (c) AMP forms ADP by this reaction to take part in ATP-ADP cycle. AMP if not converted to ADP undergoes catabolism to form uric acid and is lost through urine. AMP loss is equivalent to an energy loss as de novo  AMP synthesis is an energy-consuming process.]\nV. ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN\nEnergy-rich molecules, such as glucose, are metabolized by a series of \noxidation reactions ultimately yielding carbon dioxide and water (H 2O), \nas shown in Figure 11.6 . The metabolic intermediates of these reactions \ndonate electrons to specific coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucle-otide (NAD\n+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), to form the energy-\nrich reduced forms, NADH and FADH 2. These reduced coenzymes can, \nin turn, each donate a pair of electrons to a specialized set of electron carriers, collectively called the electron transport chain (ETC), described in this section. As electrons are passed down the ETC, they lose much of their free energy. This energy is used to move H\n+ across the inner mito-\nchondrial membrane, creating a H+ gradient that drives the production of \nATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P i), described on p. 167. The \ncoupling of electron transport with ATP synthesis is called oxidative phos-phorylation, sometimes denoted as OXPHOS. It proceeds continuously in all tissues that contain mitochondria.

Mitochondrial electron transport chain\nThe ETC (except for cytochrome c, see p. 165) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the final common pathway by which electrons derived from different fuels of the body flow to oxygen (O\n2), \nreducing it to H 2O (see Fig. 11.6 ).\n 1. Mitochondrial membranes:  The mitochondrion contains an outer \nand an inner membrane separated by the intermembrane space. Although the outer membrane contains special channels (formed by the protein porin), making it freely permeable to most ions and small molecules, the inner membrane is a specialized structure that is impermeable to most small ions, including H\n+, and small mole-\ncules such as ATP, ADP, pyruvate, and other metabolites important to mitochondrial function (\nFig. 11.7 ). Specialized carriers or trans-\nport systems are required to move ions or molecules across this membrane. The inner mitochondrial membrane is unusually rich in proteins, over half of which are directly involved in oxidative phos-phorylation. It also contains convolutions, called cristae, which greatly increase its surface area.\n 2. Mitochondrial matrix:  The gel-like solution of the matrix (interior) \nof mitochondria is also rich in proteins. These include the enzymes responsible for the oxidation of pyruvate, amino acids, and fatty acids (by \u03b2-oxidation) as well as those of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) \ncycle. The synthesis of glucose, urea, and heme occurs partially in the matrix of mitochondria. In addition, the matrix contains NAD\n+ \nand FAD (the oxidized forms of the two coenzymes that are required as electron acceptors), and ADP and P\ni, which are used to produce \nATP. [Note: The matrix also contains mitochondrial deoxyribonu-cleic acid (mtDNA), ribonucleic acid (mtRNA), and ribosomes.]\nB. Organization\nThe inner mitochondrial membrane contains four separate protein complexes, called Complexes I, II, III, and IV that each contain part of the ETC (\nFig. 11.8 ). These complexes accept or donate electrons to the \nrelatively mobile electron carrier coenzyme Q (CoQ) and cytochrome c. Each carrier in the ETC can receive electrons from an electron donor and can subsequently donate electrons to the next acceptor in the chain. The electrons ultimately combine with O\n2 and H+ to form H 2O. This \nrequirement for O 2 makes the electron transport process the respiratory \nchain, which accounts for the greatest portion of the body\u2019s use of O 2.\nC.

            "Text": "V. Electron Transport Chain 165\n 1. NADH formation:  NAD+ is reduced to NADH by dehydrogenases  \nthat remove two hydrogen atoms from their substrate. [Note: For examples of these reactions, see the discussion of the dehydroge-\nnases  of the TCA cycle, p. 207.] Both electrons but only one H\n+ (that \nis, a hydride ion [:H\u2212]) are transferred to the NAD+, forming NADH \nplus a free H+.\n 2. NADH dehydrogenase:  The free H+ plus the hydride ion carried by \nNADH are transferred to NADH dehydrogenase , a protein complex \n(Complex I) embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Complex I has a tightly bound molecule of flavin mononucleo-tide (FMN), a coenzyme structurally related to FAD (see Fig. 32.15, p. 533) that accepts the two hydrogen atoms (2 electrons + 2 H\n+), \nbecoming FMNH 2. NADH dehydrogenase  also contains peptide \nsubunits with Fe-S centers ( Fig. 11.9 ). At Complex I, electrons move \nfrom NADH to FMN to the iron of the Fe-S centers and then to CoQ. As electrons flow, they lose energy. This energy is used to pump four H\n+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, from the matrix \nto the intermembrane space.\n 3. Succinate dehydrogenase:  At Complex II, electrons from the \nsuccinate dehydrogenase \u2013catalyzed oxidation of succinate to fuma-\nrate move from the coenzyme, FADH 2, to an Fe-S protein, and then \nto CoQ. [Note: Because no energy is lost in this process, no H+ are \npumped at Complex II.]\n 4. Coenzyme Q:  CoQ is a quinone derivative with a long, hydro-\nphobic isoprenoid tail. It is made from an intermediate of cholesterol synthesis (see p. 344). [Note: It is also called ubiquinone because it is ubiquitous in biologic systems.] CoQ is a mobile electron carrier and can accept electrons from NADH dehydrogenase  (Complex I), \nfrom succinate dehydrogenase  (Complex II) and from other mito-\nchondrial dehydrogenases , such as glycerol 3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase  (see p. 171) and acyl CoA dehydrogenases  (see p. 309). \nCoQ transfers electrons to Complex III (cytochrome bc\n1).

Cytochromes:  The remaining members of the ETC are cytochrome \nproteins. Each contains a heme group (a porphyrin ring plus iron). Unlike the heme groups of hemoglobin, the cytochrome iron is reversibly converted from its ferric (Fe\n3+) to its ferrous (Fe2+) form \nas a normal part of its function as an acceptor and donor of elec-trons. Electrons are passed along the chain from cytochrome bc\n1 \n(Complex III), to cytochrome c, and then to cytochromes a + a 3 \n([Complex IV], see Fig. 11.8 ). As electrons flow, four H+ are pumped \nacross the inner mitochondrial membrane at Complex III and two at Complex IV. [Note: Cytochrome c is located in the intermembrane space, loosely associated with the outer face of the inner membrane. As seen with CoQ, cytochrome c is a mobile electron carrier.]\n 6. Cytochrome a + a\n3: Because this cytochrome complex (Complex IV) \nis the only electron carrier in which the heme iron has an available coordination site that can react directly with O\n2, it also is called \ncytochrome c oxidase . At Complex IV, the transported electrons, \nO2, and free H+ are brought together, and O 2 is reduced to H 2O (see \nFig. 11.8 ). [Note: Four electrons are required to reduce one mole-\ncule of O 2 to two molecules of H 2O.] Cytochrome c oxidase  contains \nCu atoms that are required for this complicated reaction to occur. Electrons move from Cu\nA to cytochrome a to cytochrome a 3 (in \nassociation with Cu B) to O 2.\n 7. Site-specific inhibitors:  Inhibitors of specific sites in the ETC have \nbeen identified and are illustrated in Figure 11.10 . These respira-\ntory inhibitors prevent the passage of electrons by binding to a component of the chain, blocking the oxidation-reduction reaction. Other than these inhibitors shown in the \nFigure 11.10 , carboxin and \nthenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) are known to block electron flow from complex II. Therefore, all electron carriers before the block are fully reduced, whereas those located after the block are oxidized. [Note: Inhibition of the ETC inhibits ATP synthesis because these processes are tightly coupled (see p. 169).]\nLeakage of electrons from the ETC produces reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS), such as superoxide (O 2\u2022), hydrogen peroxide \n(H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022). ROS damage DNA and \nproteins and cause lipid peroxidation. Enzymes such as superoxide dismutase  (SOD ), catalase , and glutathione perox-\nidase  are cellular defenses against ROS (see p. 812).\nD.

            "Text": "V. Electron Transport Chain 167\n 1. Redox pairs:  Oxidation (loss of electrons) of one substance is \nalways accompanied by reduction (gain of electrons) of a second. For example, \nFigure 11.11  shows the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ \nby NADH dehydrogenase  at Complex I, accompanied by the reduc-\ntion of FMN, the prosthetic group, to FMNH 2. Such redox reac-\ntions can be written as the sum of two separate half reactions, one an oxidation and the other a reduction (see \nFig. 11.11 ). NAD+ and \nNADH form a redox pair, as do FMN and FMNH 2. Redox pairs differ \nin their tendency to lose electrons. This tendency is a characteristic of a particular redox pair and can be quantitatively specified by a constant, E\n0 (the standard reduction potential), with units in volts.\n 2. Standard reduction potential:  The E 0 of various redox pairs can be \nordered from the most negative E 0 to the most positive. The more \nnegative the E 0 of a redox pair, the greater the tendency of the \nreductant member of that pair to lose electrons. The more positive the E\n0, the greater the tendency of the oxidant member of that pair \nto accept electrons. Therefore, electrons flow from the pair with the more negative E\n0 to that with the more positive E 0. The E 0 values for \nsome members of the ETC are shown in Figure 11.12 . [Note: The \ncomponents of the chain are arranged in order of increasingly posi-tive E\n0 values.]\n 3. Relationship of \u0394G0 to \u0394E0: The \u0394G0 is related directly to the \nmagnitude of the change in E 0:\n\u0394G0 = \u2212nF \u0394E0,\n where  n = number of electrons transferred (1 for a cytochrome, 2 \nfor NADH, FADH 2, and CoQ)\n  F = Faraday constant (23.1 kcal/volt mol)   \u0394E\n0 = E 0 of the electron-accepting pair minus the E 0 of the \nelectron-donating pair\n  \u0394G0 = change in the standard free energy\n 4. \u0394G0 of ATP:  The \u0394G0 for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP is \n+7.3 kcal/mol. The transport of a pair of electrons from NADH to O\n2 through the ETC releases 52.6 kcal (nF \u0394E0 = 2*23.1*1.14). Total \nnumber of protons pumped out of inner mitochondrial membrane is 10. For synthesis of one ATP, average number of protons that need to enter through FoF1 complex is 3. For transport of Pi to mito-chondrial matrix, one hydroxyl ion goes out of matrix by the Pi trans-\nporter. This is equivalent to entry of one proton. So for synthesis of one ATP, four protons enter into the matrix. Thus, one NADH produces 2.5 (10/4 = 2.5) ATP, sometimes expressed as a P/O ratio (ATP made per O atom reduced) of 2.5 (\nFig. 11.13 ). Energy captured \nas currency of energy is 18.25 (2.5 * 7.3 = 18.25) kcal. Efficiency of an energy-capturing system is calculated by using following equation:\n   Efficiency = (Energy captured \u00f7 energy released) * 100 \n   So, the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation when one NADH \nforms 2.5 ATP is 34.7% [(18.25/52.6)*100].

PHOSPHORYLATION OF ADP TO ATP\nThe transfer of electrons down the ETC is energetically favored because \nNADH is a strong electron donor and O 2 is an avid electron acceptor. \nHowever, the flow of electrons does not directly result in ATP synthesis.\nA. Chemiosmotic hypothesis\nThe chemiosmotic hypothesis (also known as the Mitchell hypothesis) explains how the free energy generated by the transport of electrons by the ETC is used to produce ATP from ADP + P\ni.\n 1. Proton pump:  Electron transport is coupled to ADP phosphoryla-\ntion by the pumping of H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, \nfrom the matrix to the intermembrane space, at Complexes I, III, and IV. For each pair of electrons transferred from NADH to O\n2, \n10 H+ are pumped. This creates an electrical gradient (with more \npositive charges on the cytosolic side of the membrane than on the matrix side) and a pH (chemical) gradient (the cytosolic side of the membrane is at a lower pH than the matrix side), as shown in \nFigure 11.14 . The energy (proton-motive force) generated by \nthese gradients is sufficient to drive ATP synthesis. Thus, the H+ \ngradient serves as the common intermediate that couples oxidation to phosphorylation.\n 2. ATP synthase:  The multisubunit enzyme ATP synthase  ([Complex V] \nFig. 11.15 ) synthesizes ATP using the energy of the H+ gradient. It \ncontains a membrane domain (F o) that spans the inner mitochondrial \nmembrane and an extramembranous domain (F 1) that appears as a \nsphere that protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix (see Fig. 11.14 ). \nThe chemiosmotic hypothesis proposes that after H+ have been \npumped to the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, they reenter the matrix by passing through a H\n+ channel in the F o Figure 11.13\nSynthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation.I\nIIIIIC Q\nIV V4H+\nNADH+NAD+\nNADH+:\nTotal proton pumped out = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10Total proton pumped in for 1 ATP synthesis = 3 + 1 = 4\nNo. of ATP produced from 1 NADH = 10 = 2.5                  4 \nFADH\n2:\nTotal proton pumped out = 4 + 2 = 6Total proton pumped in for 1 ATP synthesis = 3 + 1 = 4\nNo. of ATP produced from 1 FADH2 = 6 = 1.5                   4FADH\n2Pi + ADP ATP\nFAD4H+2H+H+3H+Pi\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   168 24-10-2020   12:08:18"

Rotation in F o causes \nconformational changes in the three \u03b2 subunits of F 1 that allow them \nto bind ADP + P i, phosphorylate ADP to ATP, and release ATP. One \ncomplete rotation of the c ring produces three ATP. [Note: ATP \nsynthase  is also called F1/Fo-ATPase  because the enzyme can also \ncatalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and P i.]\n a. Coupling in oxidative phosphorylation:  In normal mitochon-\ndria, ATP synthesis is coupled to electron transport through the H\n+ gradient. Increasing (or decreasing) one process has the \nsame effect on the other. For example, hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and P\ni in energy-requiring reactions increases the avail-\nability of substrates for ATP synthase  and, thus, increases H+ \nflow through the enzyme. Electron transport and H+ pumping \nby the ETC increase to maintain the H+ gradient and allow \nATP synthesis.\n b. Oligomycin:  This drug binds to the F o (hence the letter \u201co\u201d) domain \nof ATP synthase , closing the H+ channel and preventing reentry \nof H+ into the matrix, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of ADP \nto ATP. Because the pH and electrical gradients cannot be dissi-pated in the presence of this phosphorylation inhibitor, electron transport stops because of the difficulty of pumping any more H\n+ \nagainst the steep gradient. This dependency of cellular respiration on the ability to phosphorylate ADP to ATP is known as respira-tory control and is the consequence of the tight coupling of these processes.F1 in the mitochondrial \nmatrix contains the catalytic activity. \nF\no in the inner\nmitochondrialmembranecontains the H\n+\nchannel.b\nd\nbb\ng eaa\naADP + Pi\nATP\nb2\nH+\nH+aCCCCC\nFigure 11.15\nATP synthase  (F1Fo-ATPase ).

Uncoupling proteins:  Uncoupling proteins (UCP) occur in the \ninner mitochondrial membrane of mammals, including humans. These proteins form channels that allow H\n+ to reenter the \nmitochondrial matrix without energy being captured as ATP (\nFig. 11.16 ). The energy is released as heat, and the process \nis called nonshivering thermogenesis. UCP1, also called ther-mogenin, is responsible for heat production in the mitochon-dria-rich brown adipocytes of mammals. [Note: Cold causes catecholamine-dependent activation of UCP1 expression.] In brown fat, unlike the more abundant white fat, ~90% of its respiratory energy is used for thermogenesis in infants in response to cold. Thus, brown fat is involved in energy expen-diture, whereas white fat is involved in energy storage. [Note: Brown fat depots have recently been shown to be present in adults.]\n d. Synthetic uncouplers:  Electron transport and phosphoryla-\ntion of ADP can also be uncoupled by compounds that shuttle H\n+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, dissipating the \ngradient. The classic example is 2,4-dinitrophenol, a lipophilic H\n+ carrier (ionophore) that readily diffuses through the mito-\nchondrial membrane ( Fig. 11.17 ). This uncoupler causes elec-\ntron transport to proceed at a rapid rate without establishing a H\n+ gradient, much as do the UCP. There are many examples \nof uncouplers e.g., carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (CCP), etc. Again, energy is released as heat rather than being used to synthesize ATP. Valinomycin is a K\n+ ionophore that inhibits ATP synthesis \nbecause electrical gradient created by ETC due to proton gradient is lost. Nigericin creates an antiport on inner mito-chondrial membrane and brings in protons into but extrudes out K\n+ from matrix. It maintains the electrical gradient but pH \n(or proton) gradient is lost, leading to inhibition of ATP synthesis. This proves that both electrical gradient and pH gradient are crucial for driving ATP synthase . [Note: In high doses, aspirin \nand other salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. This explains the fever that accompanies toxic overdoses of these drugs.]\nB. Membrane transport systems\nThe inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to most charged or hydrophilic substances. However, it contains numerous transport proteins that permit passage of certain molecules from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.\n 1. ATP and ADP transport:  The inner membrane requires specialized \ncarriers to transport ADP and P\ni from the cytosol (where ATP is \nhydrolyzed to ADP in many energy-requiring reactions) into mito-chondria, where ATP can be resynthesized. An adenine nucleotide antiporter imports one ADP from the cytosol into the matrix, while exporting one ATP from the matrix into the cytosol (see \nFig. 11.14 ). \nAtractyloside and bongkrekic acid are inhibitors of adenine nucleo-tide antiporter. A symporter cotransports P\ni and H+ from the cytosol \ninto the matrix.ATP \nsynthase\nATP Uncoupling\nprotein\nH+H+H+\nH+H+\nO2\nH2O\ne\u2013H+\nH+\nMITOCHONDRIAL\nMATRIXUncoupling proteins create a \nchannel, allowing protons (H+)\nto reenter the mitochondrial \nmatrix without capturing any \nenergy as ATP.\nADP\nFigure 11.16\nTransport of protons across the \nmitochondrial membrane by an uncoupling protein.

DHAP = dihydroxyacetone phosphate; NAD(H) = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; H\n+ = proton; \nFAD(H 2) = flavin adenine dinucleotide; \nCoQ = coenzyme Q. 2. Reducing equivalent transport:  The inner mitochondrial membrane \nlacks an NADH transporter, and NADH produced in the cytosol (for example, in glycolysis; see p. 197) cannot directly enter the mito-chondrial matrix. However, reducing equivalents of NADH are trans-ported from the cytosol into the matrix using substrate shuttles. In the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle (\nFig. 11.18A ), two electrons are \ntransferred from NADH to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by cyto-solic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase . The glycerol 3-phos-\nphate produced is oxidized by the mitochondrial isozyme as FAD is reduced to FADH\n2. CoQ of the ETC oxidizes the FADH 2. Therefore, \nthe glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle results in the synthesis of 1.5 ATP for each cytosolic NADH oxidized. This contrasts with the malate-aspartate shuttle (\nFig. 11.18B ), which produces NADH (rather than \nFADH 2) in the mitochondrial matrix, thereby yielding 2.5 ATP for \neach cytosolic NADH oxidized by malate dehydrogenase  as oxalo-\nacetate is reduced to malate. A transport protein moves malate into the mitochondrial matrix. The glycerol 3-phosphate shuttles are abundant in skeletal muscles but hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes contain mostly malate-aspartate shuttles.\nC. Mitochondria and apoptosis\nThe process of apoptosis (programmed cell death) may be initiated through the intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) pathway by the forma-tion of pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. These pores allow cytochrome c to leave the intermembrane space and enter the cytosol. There, cytochrome c, in association with proapoptotic factors, activates a family of proteolytic enzymes (the caspases ), causing cleavage of key \nproteins and resulting in the morphologic and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis.\nVII. Medical Perspectives\nCarbon monoxide (CO), cyanide and hydrogen sulfide are inhibitors of \nelectron transfer from cytC to O 2. Carbon monoxide inhibits the enzyme \ncytochrome c oxidase  of human mitochondrial respiratory chain. \nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a serious risk whenever CO is released in \na closed space like a closed car or closed room. Sleeping in a parked car with engine on and AC running has caused deaths due to CO poisoning. Symptoms start as dizziness, weakness, confusion and can progress to arrhythmias, seizures and death.\nOXPHOS disease is the clinical disease involving components of oxida-\ntive phosphorylation. They may be caused by mutations in nuclear or mito-chondrial DNA. They are described in the Clinical Case Question below.\nInhibitors of ETC can target complexes I, II, III, IV, ATP synthase  and \nATP-ADP antiporter.\nRotenone, which is used as a pesticide in farming, inhibits aerobic cellular \nrespiration by blocking NADH dehydrogenase .\nExposure to potassium cyanide can be rapidly fatal.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   171 24-10-2020   12:08:20"

Chapter Summary\nThe change  in free energy  (\u0394G) occurring during a reaction predicts the direction  in which that reaction will sponta-\nneously proceed. If \u0394G is negative  (that is, the product has a lower free energy than the substrate), then the reaction is \nspontaneous  as written. If \u0394G is positive , then the reaction is not spontaneous . If \u0394G = 0, then the reaction is in equi-\nlibrium . The \u0394G of the forward reaction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the back reaction. The \u0394G \nare additive  in any sequence of consecutive reactions, as are the standard free energy changes ( \u0394G0). Therefore, reac-\ntions or processes that have a large, positive \u0394G are made possible by coupling  with those that have a large, negative \n\u0394G such as ATP hydrolysis . The reduced coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  (NADH ) and flavin adenine \ndinucleotide  (FADH 2) each donate a pair of electrons to a specialized set of electron carriers , consisting of flavin \nmononucleotide  (FMN ), iron-sulfur centers , coenzyme Q , and a series of heme-containing cytochromes , collectively \ncalled the electron transport chain . This pathway is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane  (impermeable to \nmost substances) and is the final common pathway by which electrons derived from different fuels of the body flow to oxygen (O\n2), which has a large, positive reduction potential  (E0), reducing it to water. The terminal cytochrome, cyto-\nchrome c oxidase , is the only cytochrome able to bind O 2. Electron transport results in the pumping of protons  (H+) \nacross the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix to the intermembrane space, 10 H+ per NADH oxidized. This \nprocess creates electrical  and pH gradients  across the inner mitochondrial membrane. After H+ have been transferred \nto the cytosolic side of the membrane, they reenter the matrix by passing through the Fo H+ channel in ATP synthase  \n(Complex V ), dissipating the pH and electrical gradients and causing conformational changes in the F1 \u03b2 subunits of the \nsynthase  that result in the synthesis of ATP from ADP + inorganic phosphate. Electron transport  and phosphorylation  \nare tightly coupled in oxidative phosphorylation  ([OXPHOS ], Fig. 11.19 ). Inhibition of one process inhibits the other. \nThese processes can be uncoupled by uncoupling protein-1  of the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocytes \nand by synthetic compounds such as 2,4-dinitrophenol  and aspirin , all of which dissipate the H+ gradient. In uncou-\npled mitochondria, the energy produced by electron transport is released as heat  rather than being used to synthesize \nATP . Mutations in mitochondrial DNA , which is maternally inherited , are responsible for some cases of mitochondrial \ndiseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy . The release of cytochrome c  into the cytoplasm and subsequent \nactivation of proteolytic caspases  results in apoptotic cell death .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   172 24-10-2020   12:08:21"

Bioenergetics and Oxidative Phosphorylation\nAnswer\u2014A:  Thirteen of the ~90 polypeptides required \nfor oxidative phosphorylation are encoded by mtDNA and synthesized in mitochondria, whereas the remaining proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA synthesized in the cytosol, and then transported into mitochondria. Defects in oxidative phosphorylation are more likely a result of altera-tions in mtDNA, which has a mutation rate about 10 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. Tissues with the greatest ATP requirement (e.g., the central nervous system, skel-etal and heart muscles, and the liver) are most affected by defects in oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in mtDNA are responsible for several diseases, including some cases of mitochondrial myopathies, and LHON, a disease in which bilateral loss of central vision occurs as a result of neuroretinal degeneration, including damage to the optic nerve. Mutations in NADH Q reductase  (MT-ND1, MT-ND4, \nMT-ND4L, and MT-ND6) cause this disease.11.1. A 20-year-old male subject developed sudden \nloss of vision of his right eye.

When phosphorylation is uncou-\npled from electron flow, a decrease in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and, there-fore, impaired ATP synthesis are expected. In an attempt to compensate for this defect in energy capture, metab-olism and electron flow to oxygen are increased. This hypermetabolism will be accompanied by elevated body temperature because the energy in fuels is largely wasted, appearing as heat. The electron transport chain will still be inhibited by cyanide.11.1. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP), an uncoupler of oxidative \nphosphorylation, was used as a weight-loss agent in the 1930s. Reports of fatal overdoses led to its discontinuation in 1939. Which of the following would most likely be true concerning individuals taking 2,4-DNP?\nA. ATP levels in the mitochondria are greater than \nnormal.\nB. Body temperature is elevated as a result of \nhypermetabolism.\nC. Cyanide has no effect on electron flow.D. The proton gradient across the inner mito-\nchondrial membrane is greater than normal.\nE. The rate of electron transport is abnormally \nlow.\nCorrect answer = E.  Oxygen is the terminal acceptor of \nelectrons in the electron transport chain (ETC). Electrons flow down the ETC to oxygen because it has the highest (most positive) reduction potential (E\n0). The other choices \nprecede oxygen in the ETC and have lower E 0 values.11.2. Which of the following has the strongest tendency \nto gain electrons?\nA. Coenzyme Q\nB. Cytochrome cC. Flavin adenine dinucleotideD. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideE. Oxygen\nAnswer = There is no transporter for nicotinamide adenine \ndinucleotide (NADH) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, cytoplasmic NADH can be oxidized to NAD\n+ by \nmalate dehydrogenase as oxaloacetate (OAA) is reduced to malate. The malate is transported across the inner membrane to the matrix where the mitochondrial isozyme of malate dehydrogenase oxidizes it to OAA as mito-chondrial NAD\n+ is reduced to NADH. This NADH can be \noxidized by Complex I of the electron transport chain, generating three ATP through the coupled processes of oxidative phosphorylation.11.3. Explain why and how the malate-aspartate shuttle \nmoves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.\nAnswer = Inhibition of electron transport by respiratory \ninhibitors such as CO results in an inability to maintain the proton (H\n+) gradient. Therefore, phosphorylation of ADP to \nATP is inhibited, as are ancillary reactions such as calcium uptake by mitochondria, because they also require the H\n+ \ngradient.11.4. Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to and inhibits \nComplex IV of the electron transport chain. What effect, if any, should this respiratory inhibitor have on phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP?\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   175 24-10-2020   12:08:25"

            "Text": "12Introduction to \nCarbohydrates\nI. OVERVIEW\nCarbohydrates (saccharides) are the most abundant organic molecules in \nnature. They have a wide range of functions, including providing a signifi-cant fraction of the dietary calories for most organisms, acting as a storage form of energy in the body, and serving as cell membrane components that mediate some forms of intercellular communication. Carbohydrates also serve as a structural component of many organisms, including the cell walls of bacteria, the exoskeleton of insects, and the fibrous cellulose of plants. [Note: The full set of carbohydrates produced by an organism is its glycome.] The empiric formula for many of the simpler carbohydrates is (CH\n2O)n, where \nn \u22653, hence the name \u201chydrate of carbon.\u201d\nII. CLASSIFICATION AND STRUCTURE\nMonosaccharides (simple sugars) can be classified according to the number of carbon atoms they contain. Examples of some monosaccha-rides commonly found in humans are listed in \nFigure 12.1 . They can also be \nclassified by the type of carbonyl group they contain. Carbohydrates with an aldehyde as their carbonyl group are called aldoses, whereas those with a keto as their carbonyl group are called ketoses (\nFig. 12.2 ). For example, \nglyceraldehyde is an aldose, whereas dihydroxyacetone is a ketose. Carbohydrates that have a free carbonyl group have the suffix -ose. [Note: Ketoses have an additional \u201cul\u201d in their suffix such as xylulose. There are exceptions, such as fructose, to this rule.] Monosaccharides can be linked by glycosidic bonds to create larger structures (\nFig. 12.3 ). Disaccharides \ncontain two monosaccharide units, oligosaccharides contain three to ten monosaccharide units, and polysaccharides contain more than ten mono-saccharide units and can be hundreds of sugar units in length.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Discuss and differentiate monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides\n\u2022 Describe the processes involved in digestion and assimilation of \ncarbohydrates.\nFigure 12.1\nExamples of monosaccharides found \nin humans, classified according to the number of carbons they contain.3 Carbons:  trioses    \n4 Carbons:  tetroses\n5 Carbons:  pentoses \n6 Carbons:  hexoses  \n7 Carbons:  heptoses  \n9 Carbons:  nonosesGlyceraldehyde\nErythroseRibose GlucoseSedoheptuloseNeuraminic acidGENERIC NAMES\nEXAMPLES\nGlyceraldehydeCH2OHCHC\nOHHO\nDihydroxyacetoneCH2OHCOCH2OH\nCH\n2\nOH\nC\nO\nCH\n2\nOHKeto group\nC\nH\nC\nOH\nH\nO\nAldehyde groupAB\nFigure 12.2\nExamples of an aldose (A) and a ketose \n(B) sugar.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   176 24-10-2020   12:08:25"

            "Text": "II. Classification and Structure 177\nA. Isomers and epimers\nCompounds that have the same chemical formula but have different \nstructures are called isomers. For example, fructose, glucose, mannose, and galactose are all isomers of each other, having the same chem-ical formula, C\n6H12O6. Carbohydrate isomers that differ in configura-\ntion around only one specific carbon atom (with the exception of the carbonyl carbon, see C. 1. below) are defined as epimers of each other. For example, glucose and galactose are C-4 epimers because their structures differ only in the position of the \u2013OH (hydroxyl) group at carbon 4. [Note: The carbons in sugars are numbered beginning at the end that contains the carbonyl carbon (that is, the aldehyde or keto group), as shown in \nFig. 12.4 .] Glucose and mannose are C-2 epimers. \nHowever, because galactose and mannose differ in the position of \u2013OH groups at two carbons (carbons 2 and 4), they are isomers rather than epimers (see \nFig. 12.4 ).\nB. Enantiomers\nA special type of isomerism is found in the pairs of structures that are mirror images of each other. These mirror images are called enantio-mers, and the two members of the pair are designated as a \nD- and \nan L-sugar ( Fig. 12.5 ). The vast majority of the sugars in humans are \nD-isomers. In the D-isomeric form, the \u2013OH group on the asymmetric \ncarbon (a carbon linked to four different atoms or groups) farthest from the carbonyl carbon is on the right, whereas in the \nL-isomer, it is on \nthe left. Most enzymes are specific for either the D or the L form, but \nenzymes known as isomerases  are able to interconvert D- and L-isomers.\nC. Monosaccharide cyclization\nLess than 1% of each of the monosaccharides with five or more \ncarbons exists in the open-chain (acyclic) form in solution. Rather, they are predominantly found in a ring (cyclic) form, in which the alde-hyde (or keto) group has reacted with a hydroxyl group on the same sugar, making the carbonyl carbon (carbon 1 for an aldose, carbon 2 for a ketose) asymmetric. This asymmetric carbon is referred to as the anomeric carbon.\n 1. Anomers:  Creation of an anomeric carbon (the former carbonyl \ncarbon) generates a new pair of isomers, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 configurations of \nthe sugar (for example, \u03b1-\nD-glucopyranose and \u03b2-D-glucopyranose), \nas shown in Figure 12.6 , that are anomers of each other. [Note: In \nthe \u03b1 configuration, the \u2013OH group on the anomeric carbon proj-\nects to the same side as the ring in a modified Fischer projec-tion formula (see \nFig. 12.6A ) and is trans to the CH 2OH group in \na Haworth projection formula (see Fig. 12.6B ). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms \nare not mirror images, and they are referred to as diastereomers.] Enzymes are able to distinguish between these two structures and use one or the other preferentially. For example, glycogen is synthe-sized from \u03b1-\nD-glucopyranose, whereas cellulose is synthesized \nfrom \u03b2-D-glucopyranose. The cyclic \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of a sugar in \nsolution spontaneously (but slowly) form an equilibrium mixture, a process known as mutarotation (see \nFig. 12.6 ). [Note: For glucose, \nthe \u03b1 form makes up 36% of the mixture.]\n 2.

Such sugars can react with chromogenic agents (for example, the Benedict reagent) causing the reagent to be reduced and colored as the aldehyde group of the acyclic sugar is oxidized to a carboxyl group. All mono-saccharides, but not all disaccharides, are reducing sugars. [Note: Fructose, a ketose, is a reducing sugar because it can be isomer-ized to an aldose.]\nA colorimetric test can detect a reducing sugar in urine. A posi-\ntive result is indicative of an underlying pathology (because sugars are not normally present in urine) and can be followed up by more specific tests to identify the reducing sugar.\nD. Monosaccharide joining\nMonosaccharides can be joined to form disaccharides, oligosaccharides, \nand polysaccharides. Important disaccharides include lactose (galac-tose + glucose), sucrose (glucose + fructose), and maltose (glucose + glucose). Important polysaccharides include branched glycogen (from animal sources) and starch (plant sources) and unbranched cellulose (plant sources). Each is a polymer of glucose.\nE. Glycosidic bonds\nThe bonds that link sugars are called glycosidic bonds. They are formed by enzymes known as glycosyltransferases  that use nucleo-\ntide sugars (activated sugars) such as uridine diphosphate glucose as substrates. Glycosidic bonds between sugars are named according to the numbers of the connected carbons and with regard to the position of the anomeric hydroxyl group of the first sugar involved in the bond. If this anomeric hydroxyl is in the \u03b1 configuration, then the linkage is \nan \u03b1-bond. If it is in the \u03b2 configuration, then the linkage is a \u03b2-bond. \nLactose, for example, is synthesized by forming a glycosidic bond between carbon 1 of \u03b2-galactose and carbon 4 of glucose. Therefore, \nthe linkage is a \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bond (see \nFig. 12.3 ).

Carbohydrate linkage to noncarbohydrates\nCarbohydrates can be attached by glycosidic bonds to noncarbo-\nhydrate structures, including purine and pyrimidine bases (found in nucleic acids), aromatic rings (such as those found in steroids and bili-rubin), proteins (found in glycoproteins and proteoglycans), and lipids (found in glycolipids). If the group on the noncarbohydrate molecule to which the sugar is attached is an \u2013NH\n2 group, then the bond is \ncalled an N-glycosidic link. If the group is an \u2013OH, then the bond is an O-glycosidic link (\nFig. 12.7 ). [Note: All sugar-sugar glycosidic bonds are \nO-type linkages.]\nIII. DIETARY CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION\nThe principal sites of dietary carbohydrate digestion are the mouth and intestinal lumen. This digestion is rapid and is catalyzed by enzymes known as glycoside hydrolases  (glycosidases ) that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds \n(\nFig. 12.8 ). Because little monosaccharide is present in diets of mixed \nanimal and plant origin, the enzymes are primarily endoglycosidases  that \nhydrolyze polysaccharides and oligosaccharides and disaccharidases  that \nhydrolyze tri- and disaccharides into their reducing sugar components. Glycosidases  are usually specific for the structure and configuration of \nthe glycosyl residue to be removed as well as for the type of bond to be broken. The final products of carbohydrate digestion are the monosaccha-rides glucose, galactose, and fructose that are absorbed by cells (entero-cytes) of the small intestine.\nA. Salivary \u03b1-amylase\nThe major dietary polysaccharides are of plant (starch, composed of \namylose and amylopectin) and animal (glycogen) origin. During masti-cation (chewing), salivary \u03b1-amylase  acts briefly on dietary starch and \nglycogen, hydrolyzing random \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds. [Note: There are both \n\u03b1(1\u21924)- and \u03b2(1\u21924)-endoglucosidases  in nature, but humans do not \nproduce the latter. Therefore, we are unable to digest cellulose, a carbo-hydrate of plant origin containing \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds between \nglucose residues.] Because branched amylopectin and glycogen also contain \u03b1(1\u21926) bonds, which \u03b1-amylase  cannot hydrolyze, the digest \nresulting from its action contains a mixture of short, branched and unbranched oligosaccharides known as dextrins (\nFig. 12.9 ). [Note: \nDisaccharides are also present as they, too, are resistant to amylase .] \nCarbohydrate digestion halts temporarily in the stomach, because the high acidity inactivates salivary \u03b1-amylase .\nB. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase\nWhen the acidic stomach contents reach the small intestine, they are \nneutralized by bicarbonate secreted by the pancreas, and pancreatic \n\u03b1-amylase  continues the process of starch digestion.\nC. Intestinal disaccharidases\nThe final digestive processes occur primarily at the mucosal lining of \nthe duodenum and upper jejunum and include the action of several disaccharidases  (see \nFig. 12.9 ). For example, isomaltase  cleaves the \n\u03b1(1\u21926) bond in isomaltose, and maltase  cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21924) bond in \nmaltose and maltotriose, each producing glucose.

These enzymes are transmembrane proteins of \nthe brush border on the luminal (apical) surface of the enterocytes.\nSucrase  and isomaltase  are enzymic activities of a single protein \nthat is cleaved into two functional subunits, which remain asso-ciated in the cell membrane and form the sucrase-isomaltase  (SI) \ncomplex. In contrast, maltase  is one of two enzymic activities of \nthe single membrane protein maltase-glucoamylase  (MGA ) that \ndoes not get cleaved. Its second enzymic activity, glucoamylase , \ncleaves \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds in dextrins.\nD. Intestinal absorption of monosaccharides\nThe upper jejunum absorbs the bulk of the monosaccharide products \nof digestion. However, different sugars have different mechanisms of absorption (\nFig. 12.10 ). For example, galactose and glucose are taken \ninto enterocytes by secondary active transport that requires a concur-rent uptake (symport) of sodium (Na\n+) ions. The transport protein is \nthe sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1). [Note: Sugar transport is driven by the Na\n+ gradient created by the Na+-potassium  (K+) \nATPase  that moves Na+ out of the enterocyte and K+ in (see Fig. 12.10 ).] \nFructose absorption utilizes an energy- and Na+-independent mono-\nsaccharide transporter (GLUT-5). All three monosaccharides are trans-ported from the enterocytes into the portal circulation by yet another transporter, GLUT-2. [Note: See p. 191 for a discussion of these transporters.]\nE. Abnormal degradation of disaccharides\nThe overall process of carbohydrate digestion and absorption is so effi-cient in healthy individuals that ordinarily all digestible dietary carbohy-drate is absorbed by the time the ingested material reaches the lower jejunum. However, because only monosaccharides are absorbed, any deficiency (genetic or acquired) in a specific disaccharidase  activity \nof the intestinal mucosa causes the passage of undigested carbohy-drate into the large intestine. As a consequence of the presence of this osmotically active material, water is drawn from the mucosa into the large intestine, causing osmotic diarrhea. This is reinforced by the bacterial fermentation of the remaining carbohydrate to two- and three-carbon compounds (which are also osmotically active) plus large volumes of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas (H\n2), causing abdominal \ncramps, diarrhea, and flatulence.\n 1. Digestive enzyme deficiencies:  Genetic deficiencies of the indi-\nvidual disaccharidases  result in disaccharide intolerance. Alterations \nin disaccharide degradation can also be caused by a variety of intestinal diseases, malnutrition, and drugs that injure the mucosa of the small intestine. For example, brush border enzymes are rapidly lost in normal individuals with severe diarrhea, causing a tempo-rary, acquired enzyme deficiency.

Dietary Carbohydrate Digestion 181\nrecovering from such a disorder cannot drink or eat significant \namounts of dairy products or sucrose without exacerbating the diarrhea.\n 2. Lactose intolerance:   The digestion of lactose requires intestinal \nbrush-border enzyme lactase. The deficiency of lactase, either primary or secondary, results in an inability to digest lactose. Over 60% of the world\u2019s adults are lactose intolerant (\nFig. 12.11 ). This \nis particularly manifested in certain populations. For example, up to 90% of adults of African or Asian descent are lactase  deficient. \nIn primary lactase deficiency, a genetically-caused decrease or absence of lactase is seen. Secondary lactase deficiency occurs in association with small-intestinal mucosal diseases, such as celiac disease, which affects the structure and function of brush-border enzymes. The age-dependent loss of lactase  activity starting at \napproximately 2 years of age represents a reduction in the amount of enzyme produced. It is thought to be caused by small variations in the DNA sequence of a region on chromosome 2 that controls expression of the gene for lactase , also on chromosome 2.\n   The undigested lactose undergoes bacterial fermentation in colon, \nwhere large quantities of CO\n2 and organic acids are produced and \npatients have abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps, and flatus.\n   Treatment for this disorder is to reduce consumption of milk; eat \nyogurts and some cheeses (bacterial action and aging process decrease lactose content) as well as green vegetables, such as broccoli, to ensure adequate calcium intake; use lactase -treated \nproducts; or take lactase  in pill form prior to eating.\n 3. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency:  This autosomal-\nrecessive disorder results in an intolerance of ingested sucrose. Congenital SI deficiency has a prevalence of 1:5,000 in individuals \nof European descent and appears to be much more common (up to 1:20) in the Inuit people of Greenland and Canada. Treatment includes the dietary restriction of sucrose and enzyme replacement therapy.\n 4. Diagnosis:  Identification of a specific enzyme deficiency can be \nobtained by performing oral tolerance tests with the individual disaccharides.

Lactose which remains undi-\ngested due to deficiency of lactase  is fermented in colon, producing gases and organic acids, which cause osmotic diar-\nrhea. Affected persons show improvement with lactose-free diet. Another alternative is using curd because lactobacilli in curd produce lactase.\nOral Rehydration SolutionOral rehydration solution (ORS) is the mainstay of treatment in cholera and other dehydrating diarrheal diseases. The main \ningredients of ORS are glucose and sodium chloride, as glucose-facilitated absorption of sodium and water in the small intestine remains intact in the presence of cholera toxin. The ORS is available as dry powder, to be reconstituted in spec-ified amount of clean water.\nIf ORS formulation is not available, simple solution of sugar and salt can also effectively prevent dehydration. ORS formu-\nlations containing rice or cereal as the carbohydrate source can also be effectively used.\nIntravenous Dextrose SolutionWhen a person is not able to take meals orally, intravenous solution of dextrose is given. Dextrose is a sugar similar to \nglucose. Its intravenous solutions are available is different concentration, such as 5% or 10%. It can be also used to treat low-blood sugar or water loss without electrolyte loss.\nDetection of Glucose in UrineBenedict\u2019s test is commonly done to detect presence of glucose in urine. This test is positive for several reducing sugars \nalso but being a simple test which is easy to perform, it is commonly used in primary health care centers for testing urinary glucose. \nUrine dipstick is also an easy and inexpensive method for urinary glucose analysis. It uses two coupled enzymatic reac-\ntions to measure the presence of glucose. In the first reaction, glucose is oxidized to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide by enzyme glucose oxidase . In the second reaction, hydrogen peroxide oxidizes a dye to form a colored product.\nMutarotationIn medical laboratories, standard solution of glucose is commonly prepared. In a freshly prepared solution, most of the \nglucose molecules are in \u03b1-form. Glucose oxidase , which is used to estimate the amount of glucose, acts on \u03b2-form. \nTherefore, the value obtained for a fresh glucose solution will be incorrect. Keeping the glucose solution for 12 hours allows mutarotation to occur, and then we get correct value of glucose in the solution. \nV. Chapter Summary\nMonosaccharides  (Fig. 12.12 ) containing an aldehyde group are called aldoses , and those with a keto group are called \nketoses . Disaccharides , oligosaccharides , and polysaccharides  consist of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic \nbonds . Compounds with the same chemical formula but different structures are called isomers . Two monosaccharide \nisomers differing in configuration around one specific carbon atom (not the carbonyl carbon) are defined as epimers . In \nenantiomers  (mirror images), the members of the sugar pair are designated as D-and L-isomers . When the aldehyde \ngroup on an acyclic sugar gets oxidized as a chromogenic agent gets reduced, that sugar is a reducing sugar . When \na sugar cyclizes, an anomeric carbon  is created from the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde or keto group. The sugar \ncan have two configurations, forming \u03b1 or \u03b2 anomers . A sugar can have its anomeric carbon linked to an \u2013NH 2 or an \u2013\nOH group on another structure through N- and O-glycosidic bonds , respectively. Salivary \u03b1-amylase  initiates diges-\ntion of dietary polysaccharides  (for example, starch or glycogen), producing oligosaccharides. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase  \ncontinues the process. The final digestive processes occur at the mucosal lining  of the small intestine . Several disac-\ncharidases  (for example, lactase  [\u03b2-galactosidase ], sucrase , isomaltase , and maltase ) produce monosaccharides \n(glucose, galactose, and fructose). These enzymes are transmembrane proteins  of the luminal brush border  of intes-\ntinal mucosal cells  (enterocytes ). Absorption of the monosaccharides requires specific transporters . If carbohydrate \ndegradation is deficient (as a result of heredity, disease, or drugs that injure the intestinal mucosa), undigested carbo-hydrate will pass into the large intestine, where it can cause osmotic diarrhea . Bacterial fermentation of the mate-\nrial produces large volumes of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, causing abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and flatulence. Lactose intolerance , primarily caused by the age-dependent loss of lactase  (adult-type hypolactasia ), is by far the \nmost common of these deficiencies.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   182 24-10-2020   12:08:28"

METABOLISM OVERVIEW\nIn Chapter 10, individual enzymic reactions were analyzed in an effort to \nexplain the mechanisms of catalysis. However, in cells, these reactions rarely occur in isolation. Instead, they are organized into multistep sequences called pathways, such as that of glycolysis (\nFig. 13.1 ). In a pathway, the \nproduct of one reaction serves as the substrate of the subsequent reac-tion. Most pathways can be classified as either catabolic (degradative) or anabolic (synthetic). Catabolic pathways break down complex molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, to a few simple molecules (for example, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water). Anabolic pathways form complex end products from simple precursors, for example, the synthesis of the polysaccharide glycogen from glucose. [Note: Pathways that regenerate a component are called cycles.] Different pathways can intersect, forming an integrated and purposeful network of chemical reac-tions. Metabolism is the sum of all the chemical changes occurring in a cell, a tissue, or the body. The next several chapters focus on the central meta-bolic pathways that are involved in synthesizing and degrading carbohy-drates, lipids, and amino acids.\nA.

[Note: The metabolome is the full complement of metabolites in an organism.] Throughout the next three units of this book, each pathway under discussion will be repeatedly featured as part of the major metabolic map shown in \nFigure 13.2 .\nB. Catabolic pathways\nCatabolic reactions serve to capture chemical energy in the form of ATP from the degradation of energy-rich fuel molecules. ATP generation by degradation of complex molecules occurs in three stages, as shown in \nFigure 13.3 . [Note: Catabolic pathways are typically oxidative and \nrequire oxidized coenzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\n+).] Catabolism also allows molecules in the diet (or nutrient mole-\ncules stored in cells) to be converted into basic building blocks needed for the synthesis of complex molecules. Catabolism, then, is a conver-gent process (that is, a wide variety of molecules are transformed into a few common end products).\n 1. Hydrolysis of complex molecules:  In the first stage, complex \nmolecules are broken down into their component building blocks. For example, proteins are degraded to amino acids, polysaccha-rides to monosaccharides, and fats (triacylglycerols) to free fatty acids and glycerol.\n 2. Conversion of building blocks to simple intermediates:  In the \nsecond stage, these diverse building blocks are further degraded to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and a few other simple molecules. Some energy is captured as ATP, but the amount is small compared with the energy produced during the third stage of catabolism.\n 3. Oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A:  The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) \ncycle (see p. 206) is the final common pathway in the oxidation of fuel molecules that produce acetyl CoA. Oxidation of acetyl CoA generates large amounts of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation as electrons flow from NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH\n2) \nto oxygen ([O 2], see p. 163).\nAmino\nacidsMonosaccharidesGlycerol,\nfatty acids\nTCAcycleProteins Carbohydrates Fats\nATP\nCO2Hydrolysis of complex molecules\nto their component building blocks \nConversion of building blocks to acetyl CoA \n(or other simple intermediates)\nOxidation of acetyl CoA; oxidative phosphorylation Stage I: \nStage II: \nStage III: Acetyl CoA\nFigure 13.3\nThree stages of catabolism.

            "Text": "II. Metabolism Regulation 189\nC. Anabolic pathways\nIn contrast to catabolism, anabolism is a divergent process in which a \nfew biosynthetic precursors (such as amino acids) form a wide variety of polymeric, or complex, products (such as proteins [\nFig. 13.4 ]). Anabolic \nreactions require energy (are endergonic), which is generally provided by the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P\ni). [Note: Catabolic reactions generate energy (are exer-\ngonic).] Anabolic reactions often involve chemical reductions in which the reducing power is most frequently provided by the electron donor NADPH (phosphorylated NADH, see p. 252).\nII. METABOLISM REGULATION\nThe pathways of metabolism must be coordinated so that the production of energy or the synthesis of end products meets the needs of the cell. Furthermore, individual cells function as part of a community of interacting tissues, not in isolation. Thus, a sophisticated communication system has evolved to coordinate the functions of the body. Regulatory signals that inform an individual cell of the metabolic state of the body as a whole include hormones, neurotransmitters, and the availability of nutrients. These, in turn, influence signals generated within the cell (\nFig. 13.5 ).\nA. Intracellular communication\nThe rate of a metabolic pathway can respond to regulatory signals that arise from within the cell. For example, the rate may be influenced by the availability of substrates, product inhibition, or alterations in the levels of allosteric activators or inhibitors. These intracellular signals typically elicit rapid responses and are important for the moment-to-moment regulation of metabolism.\nB. Intercellular communication\nThe ability to respond to intercellular signals is essential for the devel-opment and survival of organisms. Signaling between cells provides for long-range integration of metabolism and usually results in a response, such as a change in gene expression, that is slower than is seen with intracellular signals. Communication between cells can be mediated, for example, by surface-to-surface contact and, in some tissues, by formation of gap junctions, allowing direct communication between the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. However, for energy metabolism, the most important route of communication is chemical signaling between cells by blood-borne hormones or by neurotransmitters.\nC. Second messenger systems\nHormones and neurotransmitters can be thought of as signals and their receptors as signal detectors. Receptors respond to a bound ligand by initiating a series of reactions that ultimately result in specific intracellular responses. Second messenger molecules, so named because they inter-vene between the original extracellular messenger (the neurotransmitter or hormone) and the ultimate intracellular effect, are part of the cascade of events that converts (transduces) ligand binding into a response. Two of the most widely recognized second messenger systems are the calcium/phosphatidylinositol system (see p. 325) and the adenylyl cyclase Signaling\ncellGap\njunction\nTarget\ncellsHormoneNerve\ncell NeurotransmitterTarget\ncell\nTarget\ncell\nBlood vessel Synaptic signaling\nEndocrine signaling\nDirect contact\nFigure 13.5\nSome commonly used mechanisms \nfor transmission of regulatory signals between cells.Complex \nmolecules\nProteins\nPolysaccharides\nLipids\nNucleic acidsEnergy-yielding\nnutrients\nCarbohydrates\nFats\nProteins\nEnergy-poor\nend productsPrecursor\nmoleculesChemical\nenergy\nATP\nNADH\nCarbon dioxide\nWater\nAmmoniaAmino acids\nSugars\nFatty acids\nNitrogenous\nbasesC\nA\nT\nA\nB\nO\nL\nI\nS\nMA\nN\nA\nB\nO\nL\nI\nS\nM\nFigure 13.4\nComparison of catabolic and anabolic \npathways.

Both involve the binding of ligands, such as epinephrine or glucagon, to specific G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCR) on the cell (plasma) membrane. GPCR are character-ized by an extracellular ligand-binding domain, seven transmembrane \u03b1 \nhelices, and an intracellular domain that interacts with trimeric G proteins (\nFig. 13.6 ). [Note: Insulin, another key regulator of metabolism, binds a \nmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (see p. 439) and not a GPCR.]\nD. Adenylyl cyclase\nThe recognition of a chemical signal, such as hormones or neurotrans-mitter, by some GPCR, such as the \u03b2- and \u03b1\n2-adrenergic receptors, \ntriggers either an increase or a decrease in the activity of adenylyl \ncyclase (AC) . This is a membrane-bound enzyme that converts ATP to \n3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP , or cAMP). Each chemical \nsignal binds to a unique type of GPCR. Therefore, tissues that respond to more than one signal must have several different GPCR, each of which can be linked to AC.\n 1. Guanosine triphosphate\u2013dependent regulatory proteins:  The \neffect of the activated, occupied GPCR on second messenger formation is indirect, mediated by specialized trimeric proteins ( \u03b1, \n\u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits) of the cell membrane. These proteins, referred to \nas G proteins because the \u03b1 subunit binds guanosine di- or triphos-\nphates (GDP or GTP), form a link in the chain of communication between the receptor and AC. In the inactive form of a G protein, \nthe \u03b1 subunit is bound to GDP (\nFig. 13.7 ). Ligand binding causes \na conformational change in the receptor, triggering replacement of this GDP with GTP. The GTP-bound form of the \u03b1 subunit disso-\nciates from the \u03b2\u03b3 subunits and moves to AC, affecting enzyme \nactivity. Many molecules of active G \u03b1 protein are formed by one \nactivated receptor. [Note: The ability of a hormone or neurotrans-mitter to stimulate or inhibit AC depends on the type of G \u03b1 protein \nthat is linked to the receptor. One type, designated G\ns, stimulates \nAC (see Fig. 13.7 ), whereas another type, designated G i, inhibits \nthe enzyme (not shown).] The actions of the G \u03b1\u2013GTP complex are \nshort-lived because G \u03b1 has an inherent GTPase  activity, resulting in \nthe rapid hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This causes inactivation of G \u03b1, \nits dissociation from AC, and its reassociation with the \u03b2\u03b3 dimer.\nToxins from Vibrio cholerae (cholera) and Bordetella pertussis \n(whooping cough) cause inappropriate activation of AC \nthrough covalent modification (ADP-ribosylation) of different G proteins. With cholera, the GTPase  activity of G \u03b1\ns is inhibited \nin intestinal cells. With whooping cough, G \u03b1i is inactivated in \nrespiratory tract cells.\n 2. Protein kinases:  The next step in the cAMP second messenger \nsystem is the activation of a family of enzymes called cAMP-depen-\ndent protein kinases  such as protein kinase A (PKA) , as shown in \nFigure 13.8 . cAMP activates PKA by binding to its two regulatory \nsubunits, causing the release of its two catalytically active subunits. These subunits transfer phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates.

[Note: Several types of protein \nkinases  are not cAMP dependent, for example, protein kinase C , \ndescribed on p. 325.]\n 3. Protein phosphatases:  The phosphate groups added to proteins by \nprotein kinases  are removed by protein phosphatases , enzymes that \nhydrolytically cleave phosphate esters (see Fig. 13.8 ). This insures \nthat changes in protein activity induced by phosphorylation are not permanent.\n 4. cAMP hydrolysis:  cAMP is rapidly hydrolyzed to 5 \u2032-AMP by cAMP \nphosphodiesterase  that cleaves the cyclic 3 \u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiester \nbond. 5 \u2032-AMP is not an intracellular signaling molecule. Therefore, \nthe effects of neurotransmitter- or hormone-mediated increases of cAMP are rapidly terminated if the extracellular signal is removed. [Note: cAMP phosphodiesterase  is inhibited by caffeine, a methylx-\nanthine derivative.]\nIII. GLYCOLYSIS OVERVIEW\nThe glycolytic pathway is used by all tissues for the oxidation of glucose to provide energy (as ATP) and intermediates for other metabolic path-ways. Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtu-ally all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (\nFig. 13.9A ). Pyruvate is \nthe end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O\n2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis \nbecause O 2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxida-\ntion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ( Fig. 13.9B ). Aerobic glycolysis sets the \nstage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD\n+ (Fig. 13.9C ). This conversion of glucose to lactate is \ncalled anaerobic glycolysis because it can occur without the participation of O\n2. Anaerobic glycolysis allows the production of ATP in tissues that lack \nmitochondria (for example, red blood cells [RBC] and parts of the eye) or in cells deprived of sufficient O\n2 (hypoxia).\nIV. GLUCOSE TRANSPORT INTO CELLS\nGlucose cannot diffuse directly into cells but enters by one of two transport systems: a sodium (Na\n+)- and ATP-independent transport system or a Na+- \nand ATP-dependent cotransport system.\nA. Sodium- and ATP-independent transport system\nThis passive system is mediated by a family of 14 glucose trans-porter (GLUT) isoforms found in cell membranes. They are designated GLUT-1 to GLUT-14. These monomeric protein transporters exist in the membrane in two conformational states (\nFig. 13.10 ). Extracellular \nglucose binds to the transporter, which then alters its conformation, transporting glucose across the cell membrane via facilitated diffusion. Because GLUT transport one molecule at a time, they are uniporters.Hormone or neuro-\ntransmitter\nInactive adenylyl \ncyclase\nGTP GDP\nATP\ncAMP + PP i\nInactive\nadenylylcyclaseCytosolExtra-\ncellularspaceUnoccupied receptor does not interact with G\ns protein.\nOccupied receptor changes \nshape and interacts with a \nsubunit of Gs protein.

Specialized functions:  In facilitated diffusion, transporter-mediated \nglucose movement is down a concentration gradient (that is, from a high concentration to a lower one, therefore requiring no energy). For example, GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 are primarily involved in glucose uptake from the blood. In contrast, GLUT-2, in the liver and kidneys, can either transport glucose into these cells when blood glucose levels are high or transport glucose from these cells when blood glucose levels are low (for example, during fasting). GLUT-5 is unusual in that it is the primary transporter for fructose (not glucose) in the small intestine and the testes (see p. 87).\nB. Sodium- and ATP-dependent cotransport system\nThis energy-requiring process transports glucose against (up) its concen-tration gradient (that is, from low extracellular concentrations to higher intracellular concentrations) as Na\n+ is transported down its electro-\nchemical gradient. [Note: The gradient is created by the Na+-potassium \n(K+) ATPase  (see Fig. 12.10 , p. 180).] Because this secondary active \ntransport process requires the concurrent uptake (symport) of Na+, the \ntransporter is a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This type of cotransport occurs in the epithelial cells of the intestine (see p. 180), renal tubules, and choroid plexus. [Note: The choroid plexus, part of the blood\u2013brain barrier, also contains GLUT-1.] This transport system is the biochemical basis of adding sodium chloride to glucose in oral rehydration fluids to ensure uptake of glucose and water.\nV. GLYCOLYSIS REACTIONS\nThe conversion of glucose to pyruvate occurs in two stages ( Fig. 13.11 ). \nThe first five reactions of glycolysis correspond to an energy-investment phase in which the phosphorylated forms of intermediates are synthesized at the expense of ATP. The subsequent reactions of glycolysis constitute an energy-generation phase in which a net of two molecules of ATP are formed by substrate-level phosphorylation (see p. 198) per glucose mole-cule metabolized.\nA. Glucose phosphorylation\nPhosphorylated sugar molecules do not readily penetrate cell membranes because there are no specific transmembrane carriers for these compounds and because they are too polar to diffuse through the lipid core of membranes. Therefore, the irreversible phosphorylation of glucose (\nFig. 13.12 ) effectively traps the sugar as cytosolic glucose \n6-phosphate and commits it to further metabolism in the cell. Mammals have four isozymes (I\u2013IV) of the enzyme hexokinase  that catalyze the \nphosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate.\n 1. Hexokinases I\u2013III:  In most tissues, glucose phosphorylation is cata-\nlyzed by one of these isozymes of hexokinase , which is one of three \nregulatory enzymes of glycolysis (along with phosphofructokinase  \nand pyruvate kinase ). They are inhibited by the reaction product \nglucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates when further metabolism of this hexose phosphate is reduced. Hexokinases I\u2013III  have a low \nMichaelis constant (K\nm) and, therefore, a high affinity (see p. 140) for \nglucose.

However, because these isozymes have a \nlow maximal velocity ([V max], see p. 139) for glucose, they do not \nsequester (trap) cellular phosphate in the form of phosphorylated glucose or phosphorylate more glucose than the cell can use. [Note: These isozymes have broad substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate several hexoses in addition to glucose.]\n 2. Hexokinase IV:  In liver parenchymal cells and pancreatic \u03b2 cells, \nglucokinase  (the hexokinase IV  isozyme) is the predominant enzyme \nresponsible for glucose phosphorylation. In \u03b2 cells, glucokinase  \nfunctions as a glucose sensor, determining the threshold for insulin secretion (see p. 437). [Note: Hexokinase IV  also serves as a glucose \nsensor in hypothalamic neurons, playing a key role in the adrenergic response to hypoglycemia (see p. 443).] In the liver, the enzyme facilitates glucose phosphorylation during hyperglycemia. Despite the popular but misleading name glucokinase , the sugar specificity \nof the enzyme is similar to that of other hexokinase  isozymes.\n a. Kinetics:  Glucokinase  differs from hexokinases I\u2013III  in several \nimportant properties. For example, it has a much higher K\nm, \nrequiring a higher glucose concentration for half-saturation (see \nFig. 13.13 ). Thus, glucokinase  functions only when the intracel-\nlular concentration of glucose in the hepatocyte is elevated such as during the brief period following consumption of a carbohy-drate-rich meal, when high levels of glucose are delivered to the liver via the portal vein. Glucokinase  has a high V\nmax, allowing \nthe liver to effectively remove the flood of glucose delivered by the portal blood. This prevents large amounts of glucose from entering the systemic circulation following such a meal, thereby minimizing hyperglycemia during the absorptive period (see blue box below).

When glucose levels in the blood \n(and also in the hepatocyte, as a result of GLUT-2) increase, glucokinase  is released from GKRP, and the enzyme reenters \nthe cytosol where it phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phos-phate. [Note: GKRP is a competitive inhibitor of glucose use by glucokinase .]\nGlucokinase  functions as a glucose sensor in blood glucose \nhomeostasis. Inactivating mutations of glucokinase  are the \ncause of a rare form of diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY 2) that is characterized by impaired insulin secretion and hyperglycemia.\nB. Glucose 6-phosphate isomerization\nThe isomerization of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate is \ncatalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase  (Fig. 13.15 ). The reaction is \nreadily reversible and is not a rate-limiting or regulated step.\nC. Fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation\nThe irreversible phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by phosphofructoki-\nnase-1 (PFK-1)  is the most important control point and the rate-limiting \nand committed step of glycolysis ( Fig. 13.16 ). PFK-1  is controlled by \nthe available concentrations of the substrates ATP and fructose 6-phos-phate as well as by other regulatory molecules.\n 1. Regulation by intracellular energy levels:  PFK-1  is inhibited allo-\nsterically by elevated levels of ATP, which act as an energy-rich signal indicating an abundance of high-energy compounds. Elevated levels of citrate, an intermediate in the TCA cycle (see p. 209), also inhibit PFK-1 . [Note: Inhibition by citrate favors the use of glucose \nfor glycogen synthesis (see p. 227).] Conversely, PFK-1  is activated \nallosterically by high concentrations of AMP, which signal that the cell\u2019s energy stores are depleted.\n 2. Regulation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate:  Fructose 2,6-bispho-\nsphate is the most potent activator of PFK-1  (see \nFig. 13.16 ) and \nis able to activate the enzyme even when ATP levels are high. It is formed from fructose 6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase-2 \n(PFK-2) . Unlike PFK-1 , PFK-2  is a bifunctional protein that has both \nthe kinase  activity that produces fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the \nphosphatase  activity that dephosphorylates fructose 2,6-bisphos-\nphate to fructose 6-phosphate. In the liver isozyme, phosphorylation of PFK-2  inactivates the kinase  domain and activates the phos-\nphatase  domain (\nFig. 13.17 ). The opposite is seen in the cardiac \nisozyme. Skeletal PFK-2  is not covalently regulated. [Note: Fructose \n2,6-bisphosphate is an inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase , an \nenzyme of gluconeogenesis (see p. 219).

During the well-fed state:  Decreased levels of glucagon and \nelevated levels of insulin (such as occur following a carbohydrate-rich meal) cause an increase in hepatic fructose 2,6-bispho-sphate ( PFK-2  is dephosphorylated) and, thus, in the rate of \nglycolysis (see \nFig. 13.17 ).

This isomerization results in the net production of two mole-cules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the cleavage products of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. [Note: DHAP is utilized in triacylglycerol synthesis (see p. 305).]\nF. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate oxidation\nThe conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphospho-glycerate (1,3-BPG) by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is \nthe first oxidation-reduction reaction of glycolysis (\nFig. 13.18 ). [Note: \nBecause there is a limited amount of NAD+ in the cell, the NADH \nformed by the dehydrogenase  reaction must be oxidized for glycol-\nysis to continue. Two major mechanisms for oxidizing NADH to NAD+ \nare the reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase \n(LDH)  (anaerobic, see p. 192) and the electron transport chain ([ETC] \naerobic, see p. 164). Because NADH cannot cross the inner mitochon-drial membrane, the ETC requires the malate-aspartate and glycerol 3-phosphate substrate shuttles to move NADH reducing equivalents into the mitochondrial matrix (see p. 171).]\n 1. 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate synthesis:  The oxidation of the alde-\nhyde group of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to a carboxyl group is coupled to the attachment of P\ni to the carboxyl group. This phos-\nphate group, linked to carbon 1 of the 1,3-BPG product by a high-energy bond (see p. 163), conserves much of the free energy (see p. 159) produced by the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This high-energy phosphate drives ATP synthesis in the next reac-tion of glycolysis.\n 2. Arsenic poisoning:  The toxicity of arsenic is due primarily to the \ninhibition by trivalent arsenic (arsenite) of enzymes such as the pyru-\nvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) , which require lipoic acid as \na coenzyme (see p. 207). However, pentavalent arsenic (arsenate) can prevent net ATP and NADH production by glycolysis without inhibiting the pathway itself. It does so by competing with P\ni as a \nsubstrate for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , forming \na complex that spontaneously hydrolyzes to form 3-phosphoglyc-erate (see \nFig. 13.18 ). By bypassing the synthesis of and phosphate \ntransfer from 1,3-BPG, the cell is deprived of energy usually obtained from the glycolytic pathway. [Note: Arsenate also competes with P\ni \nbinding to the F 1 domain of ATP synthase  (see p. 197), resulting in \nformation of ADP-arsenate that is rapidly hydrolyzed.]\n 3. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate synthesis in RBC:  Some of the 1,3-BPG \nis converted to 2,3-BPG by the action of bisphosphoglycerate \nmutase  (see Fig. 13.18 ). 2,3-BPG, which is found in only trace \namounts in most cells, is present at high concentration in RBC and serves to increase O\n2 delivery (see p. 109). 2,3-BPG is hydrolyzed \nby a phosphatase  to 3-phosphoglycerate, which is also an interme-\ndiate in glycolysis (see Fig. 13.18 ).

Introduction to Metabolism and Glycolysis\nG. 3-Phosphoglycerate synthesis and ATP production\nWhen 1,3-BPG is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate, the high-energy \nphosphate group of 1,3-BPG is used to synthesize ATP from ADP (see \nFig. 13.18 ). This reaction is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase , \nwhich, unlike most other kinases , is physiologically reversible. Because \ntwo molecules of 1,3-BPG are formed from each glucose molecule, this kinase  reaction replaces the two ATP molecules consumed by the earlier \nformation of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. [Note: This reaction is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation, in which the energy needed for the production of a high-energy phosphate comes from a substrate rather than from the ETC (see J. below and p. 210 for other examples).]\nH. Phosphate group shift\nThe shift of the phosphate group from carbon 3 to carbon 2 of phos-phoglycerate by phosphoglycerate mutase  is freely reversible.\nI. 2-Phosphoglycerate dehydration\nThe dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate by enolase  redistributes the \nenergy within the substrate, forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which contains a high-energy enol phosphate (see \nFig. 13.18 ). The reaction is \nreversible, despite the high-energy nature of the product. [Note: Fluoride inhibits enolase , and water fluoridation reduces lactate production by \nmouth bacteria, decreasing dental caries (see p. 560).]\nJ. Pyruvate synthesis and ATP production\nThe conversion of PEP to pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase  (PK), \nis the third irreversible reaction of glycolysis. The high-energy enol phosphate in PEP is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and is another example of substrate-level phosphorylation (see \nFig. 13.18 ).\n 1. Feedforward regulation:  PK is activated by fructose 1,6-bisphos-\nphate, the product of the PFK-1  reaction. This feedforward (instead \nof the more usual feedback) regulation has the effect of linking the two kinase  activities: increased PFK-1  activity results in elevated \nlevels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which activates PK. [Note: PK is \ninhibited by ATP.]\n 2. Covalent regulation in the liver:  Phosphorylation by cAMP-\ndependent PKA  leads to inactivation of the hepatic isozyme of PK \n(\nFig. 13.19 ). When blood glucose levels are low, elevated glucagon \nincreases the intracellular level of cAMP, which causes the phos-phorylation and inactivation of PK in the liver only. Therefore, PEP \nis unable to continue in glycolysis and, instead, enters the gluco-neogenesis pathway. This partly explains the observed inhibition of hepatic glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon. Dephosphorylation of PK by a phosphatase  results in reactivation of \nthe enzyme.\n 3. Pyruvate kinase  deficiency:  Because mature RBC lack mitochon-\ndria, they are completely dependent on glycolysis for ATP produc-tion. ATP is required to meet the metabolic needs of RBC and to fuel the ion pumps necessary for the maintenance of the flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to squeeze through narrow capil-laries.

The resulting alterations in the RBC membrane lead to changes in cell shape and, ultimately, to phagocytosis by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly splenic macrophages. The premature death and lysis of RBC result in mild-to-severe nonspherocytic hemo-lytic anemia, with the severe form requiring regular transfusions. Among patients with rare genetic defects of glycolytic enzymes, the majority has a deficiency in PK. [Note: Liver PK is encoded by \nthe same gene as the RBC isozyme. However, liver cells show no effect because they can synthesize more PK and can also generate \nATP by oxidative phosphorylation.] Severity depends both on the degree of enzyme deficiency (generally 5%\u201335% of normal levels) and on the extent to which RBC compensate by synthesizing increased levels of 2,3-BPG (see p. 109). Almost all individuals with PK deficiency have a mutant enzyme that shows altered kinetics \nor decreased stability (\nFig. 13.20 ). Individuals heterozygous for PK \ndeficiency have resistance to the most severe forms of malaria.\nThe tissue-specific expression of PK in RBC and the liver \nresults from the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 664) of the gene that encodes the enzyme.\nK. Pyruvate reduction to lactate\nLactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaer-\nobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells ( Fig. 13.21 ). Reduction to lactate is \nthe major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria.\n 1. Lactate formation in muscle:  In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH \nproduction (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and \nby the three NAD\n+-linked dehydrogenases  of the TCA cycle, see \np. 211) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD\n+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate \nby LDH. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in \nmuscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the blood-stream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 217). The cyclical process of conversion of glucose to lactate in muscle (by anaerobic glycolysis) and conversion of lactate to glucose in liver (by gluconeogenesis) is known as Cori\u2019s cycle.\n 2. Lactate utilization:  The direction of the LDH reaction depends on \nthe relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD\n+. For example, in the liver and heart, this \nratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is either converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis or converted to acetyl CoA that is oxidized in the TCA cycle. Heart muscle exclusively oxidizes lactate to carbon dioxide and water via the TCA cycle.\n 3. Lactic acidosis:  Elevated concentrations of lactate in the plasma, \ntermed lactic acidosis (a type of metabolic acidosis), occur when Figure 13.20\nAlterations observed with various mutant forms of pyruvate kinase .

Introduction to Metabolism and Glycolysis\nthere is a collapse of the circulatory system, such as with myocar-\ndial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and uncontrolled hemorrhage, or when an individual is in shock. The failure to bring adequate amounts of O\n2 to the tissues results in impaired oxidative phos-\nphorylation and decreased ATP synthesis. To survive, the cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis for generating ATP, producing lactic acid as the end product. [Note: Production of even meager amounts of ATP may be lifesaving during the period required to reestablish adequate blood flow to the tissues.] The additional O\n2 required to recover \nfrom a period when O 2 availability has been inadequate is termed \nthe O 2 debt. [Note: The O 2 debt is often related to patient morbidity \nor mortality. In many clinical situations, measuring the blood levels of lactic acid allows the rapid, early detection of O\n2 debt in patients \nand the monitoring of their recovery.]\nL. Energy yield from glycolysis\nDespite the production of some ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis, the end product, pyruvate or lactate, still contains most of the energy originally contained in glucose. The TCA cycle is required to release that energy completely (see p. 206).\n 1. Anaerobic glycolysis:  A net of two molecules of ATP are generated \nfor each molecule of glucose converted to two molecules of lactate (\nFig. 13.22 ). There is no net production or consumption of NADH.\n 2. Aerobic glycolysis:  The generation of ATP is the same as in \nanaerobic glycolysis (that is, a net gain of two ATP per molecule of glucose). Two molecules of NADH are also produced per mole-cule of glucose. Ongoing aerobic glycolysis requires the oxidation of most of this NADH by the ETC, producing three ATP for each NADH molecule entering the chain (see p. 167). [Note: NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, and substrate shuttles are required (see p. 170).]\nVI. HORMONAL REGULATION\nRegulation of the activity of the irreversible glycolytic enzymes by allosteric activation/inhibition or covalent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is short term (that is, the effects occur over minutes or hours). Superimposed on these effects on the activity of preexisting enzyme molecules are the long-term hormonal effects on the number of new enzyme molecules. These hormonal effects can result in 10- to 20-fold increases in enzyme synthesis that typically occur over hours to days. Regular consumption of meals rich in carbohydrate or administration of insulin initiates an increase in the amount of glucokinas e, PFK-1 , and PK in the liver (\nFig. 13.23 ). The \nchange reflects an increase in gene transcription, resulting in increased enzyme synthesis. Increased availability of these three enzymes favors the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, a characteristic of the absorptive state (see p. 451). [Note: The transcriptional effects of insulin and carbohydrate (specifically glucose) are mediated by the transcription factors sterol regu-latory element\u2013binding protein-1c and carbohydrate response element\u2013binding protein, respectively. These factors also regulate transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (see p. 301).] Conversely, gene expression of the three enzymes is decreased when plasma glucagon is high and insulin is low (for example, as seen in fasting or diabetes).2 (Pyruvate)2 (Phosphoenolpyruvate)2 (2-Phosphoglycerate)2 (3-Phosphoglycerate)2 (1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate)Glyceraldehyde 3-PFructose 1,6-bis-PFructose 6-PGlucose 6-P\n2 (Lactate)\n2 NAD+2 NADH + 2 H+Glucose\nDHAP\nPi\n2 NAD+\n2 NADH + 2 H+ADPATPADPATP\n2 ADP\n2 ATP\n2 ADP\n2 ATPATP \nconsumption \nATP \nproductionNADH \nproduction\nNADH consumption\nFigure 13.22\nSummary of anaerobic glycolysis. \nReactions involving the production or consumption of ATP or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are indicated.

Glucose in glomerular filtrate beyond the saturation level of 180 mg/dl (known as renal threshold ) leads to glucosuria. Diabetes \nmellitus type II is caused due to insulin resistance, in which glucose absorption in skeletal muscles through GLUT-4 (under the influence of insulin) is reduced. Diabetes mellitus patients have high blood glucose and may have glucose and ketone bodies in urine. This is discussed in detail in chapter 29. However, in some physiological conditions like pregnancy and old age as well as pathological conditions like mutations in SGLT, there may be glucose in urine even when blood glucose is normal.\nWhen blood is taken for glucose estimation, blood cells keep utilizing \nglucose and this can decrease the estimated amount of glucose. Fluoride, which removes magnesium required by the enzyme enolase, can inhibit glycolysis and is added to blood samples so that glucose levels do not decrease in vitro before estimation is done.\nThe 2,3-BPG content of RBCs decreases in stored blood, which decreases \ntheir ability to release oxygen. This reduction can be significant for critical patients and to prevent this, additives are added to blood storage bags to replenish 2,3-BPG.\nInherited deficiency of pyruvate kinase is a rare cause of hemolytic anemia. \nDuring intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, reducing intra-cellular pH, which causes cramps. When lactic acid increases in blood, as seen in myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and uncontrolled hemorrhage, the pH of blood decreases causing a life-threatening condi-tion called metabolic acidosis.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   201 24-10-2020   12:08:37"

Chapter Summary\nMost pathways  can be classified as either catabolic  (degrade complex mole-\ncules to a few simple products with ATP production ) or anabolic  (synthesize \ncomplex end products from simple precursors with ATP hydrolysis ). The rate \nof a metabolic pathway can respond to regulatory signals  such as intracel-\nlular allosteric activators  or inhibitors . Intercellular  signaling provides for the \nintegration of metabolism. The primary route of this communication is chem-\nical signaling  (for example, by hormones  or neurotransmitters ). Second \nmessenger molecules  transduce a chemical signal (hormone or neurotrans-\nmitter binding) to appropriate intracellular responders. Adenylyl cyclase (AC ) is \na cell membrane enzyme that synthesizes cyclic adenosine monophosphate \n(cAMP ) in response to chemical signals, such as the hormones glucagon  and \nepinephrine . Following binding of a hormone to its cell-surface G protein\u2013\ncoupled receptor , a guanosine triphosphate \u2013dependent regulatory protein \n(G protein ) is activated that, in turn, activates AC. The cAMP produced acti-\nvates protein kinase A , which phosphorylates a variety of enzymes, causing \ntheir activation or deactivation. Phosphorylation is reversed by phospha-\ntases . Aerobic glycolysis , in which pyruvate  is the end product, occurs in \ncells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of oxygen ([O 2], Fig. 13.25 ). \nAnaerobic glycolysis , in which lactic acid  is the end product, occurs in \ncells that lack mitochondria and in cells deprived of sufficient O 2. Glucose \nis passively transported across membranes by 1 of 14 glucose transporter \n(GLUT) isoforms . GLUT-1  is abundant in RBC and the brain, GLUT-4  (which \nis insulin dependent ) in muscle and adipose tissue, and GLUT-2  in the liver, \nkidneys, and pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The oxidation of glucose to pyruvate ( glycol-\nysis, see Fig. 13.25 ) occurs through an energy-investment  phase in which \nphosphorylated intermediates are synthesized at the expense of ATP and an energy-generation  phase in which ATP is produced by substrate-level \nphosphorylation . In the energy-investment phase, glucose is phosphorylated \nby hexokinase  (found in most tissues) or glucokinase  (a hexokinase  found in \nliver cells  and pancreatic \u03b2 cells ). Hexokinase  has a high affinity  (low K\nm) \nand a low maximal velocity  (Vmax) for glucose and is inhibited by glucose \n6-phosphate . Glucokinase  has a high K m and a high V max for glucose. It is \nregulated indirectly by fructose 6-phosphate  (inhibits) and glucose  (activates) \nvia glucokinase regulatory protein . Glucose 6-phosphate is isomerized to \nfructose 6-phosphate , which is phosphorylated to fructose 1,6-bisphos-\nphate  by phosphofructokinase-1  (PFK-1 ). This enzyme is allosterically inhib-\nited by ATP and citrate  and activated by AMP . Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate , \nwhose synthesis by bifunctional phosphofructokinase-2  (PFK-2 ) is increased \nin the liver by insulin and decreased by glucagon, is the most potent allosteric activator of PFK-1 . A total of two ATP  are used during this phase of glycol-\nysis. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved to form two trioses that are further metabolized by the glycolytic pathway, forming pyruvate. During this phase, four ATP  and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)  are produced \nper glucose molecule. The final step in pyruvate synthesis from phospho-\nenolpyruvate  is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase  (PK). This enzyme is allo-\nsterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , and the hepatic isozyme \nis inhibited covalently by glucagon  via the cAMP pathway. PK deficiency  \naccounts for the majority of all inherited defects in glycolytic enzymes. Effects are restricted to RBC  and present as mild-to-severe chronic , nonspherocytic \nhemolytic anemia . Glycolytic gene transcription  is enhanced by insulin and \nglucose. In anaerobic glycolysis , NADH is reoxidized to NAD\n+ by the reduc-\ntion of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase . This occurs in cells \nsuch as RBC that lack mitochondria and in tissues such as exercising muscle, where production of NADH exceeds the oxidative capacity of the respiratory chain. Elevated concentrations of lactate in the plasma ( lactic acidosis ) occur \nwith circulatory system collapse or shock. Pyruvate also can be 1) oxidatively \ndecarboxylated  to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase , 2) carboxyl-\nated to oxaloacetate (a TCA cycle intermediate) by pyruvate carboxylase , or \n3) reduced  to ethanol by microbial pyruvate decarboxylase .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   202 24-10-2020   12:08:38"

CYCLE OVERVIEW\nThe tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or \nthe Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway \nwhere the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty \nacids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide \n(CO2), as shown in Figure 14.1 . This oxidation provides energy for the \nproduction of the majority of ATP in most animals, including humans. \nBecause the TCA cycle occurs totally in mitochondria, it is in close prox-\nimity to the electron transport chain ([ETC], see p. 163), which oxidizes \nthe reduced coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and \nflavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) produced by the cycle. The TCA cycle \nis an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O 2) is required as the final elec-\ntron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids \ngenerate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the \nGreek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermedi-\nates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as glucose forma-\ntion from the carbon skeletons of some amino acids and the synthesis of \nsome amino acids (see p. 402) and heme (see p. 415).

The glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate and used in glycolysis. In response to the rise in blood glucose, the insulin/glucagon ratio increases. As a result, the kinase domain of PFK-2 is dephosphorylated and active. Its product, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, allosteri-cally activates PFK-1. (PFK-1 is not covalently regulated.) Active PFK-1 produces fructose 1,6-bisphosphate that is a feedforward activator of pyruvate kinase. Hepatic pyru-vate kinase is covalently regulated, and the rise in insulin favors dephosphorylation and activation.13.1.

Therefore, the entry of one acetyl CoA into one round \nof the TCA cycle does not lead to the net production or consumption of intermediates.\nA. Acetyl CoA production\nThe major sources of acetyl CoA are glucose, pyruvate, fatty acids, and ketogenic amino acids. The major utilization of acetyl CoA is for oxidation, fatty acid formation, and formation of cholesterol and ketone bodies. \nThe major source of acetyl CoA for the TCA cycle is the oxidative \ndecarboxylation of pyruvate by the multienzyme pyruvate dehydroge-\nnase complex  (PDH complex , or PDHC ). However, the PDHC  (described \nbelow) is not a component of the TCA cycle. Pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochon-drial matrix by the pyruvate mitochondrial carrier of the inner mitochon-drial membrane. In the matrix, the PDHC  converts pyruvate to acetyl \nCoA. [Note: Fatty acid oxidation is another source of acetyl CoA (see p. 309).]\n 1.

PDH kinase  \nphosphorylates and inactivates E1, whereas PDH phosphatase  \ndephosphorylates and activates E1 (\nFig. 14.3 ). The kinase  itself is \nallosterically activated by ATP , acetyl CoA, and NADH. Therefore, in the presence of these high-energy products, the PDHC  is turned \noff. [Note: It is actually the rise in the ATP/ADP (adenosine diphos-phate), NADH/NAD\n+, or acetyl CoA/CoA ratios that affects enzymic \nactivity.] Pyruvate is a potent inhibitor of PDH kinase . Therefore, if \npyruvate concentrations are elevated, E1 will be maximally active. \nCalcium (Ca2+) is a strong activator of PDH phosphatase , stimu-\nlating E1 activity. This is particularly important in skeletal muscle, \nwhere Ca2+ release during contraction stimulates the PDHC  and, \nthus, energy production. [Note: Although covalent regulation by the kinase  and phosphatase  is primary, the PDHC  is also subject to \nproduct (NADH and acetyl CoA) inhibition.]\n 4. Deficiency:  A deficiency of the \u03b1 subunits of the tetrameric E1 \ncomponent of the PDHC , although very rare, is the most common \nbiochemical cause of congenital lactic acidosis. The deficiency results in a decreased ability to convert pyruvate to acetyl CoA, causing pyruvate to be shunted to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase  \n(see p. 199). This creates particular problems for the brain, which relies on the TCA cycle for most of its energy and is particularly sensitive to acidosis. Symptoms are variable and include neurode-generation, muscle spasticity, and, in the neonatal-onset form, early death. The gene for the \u03b1 subunit is X linked, and because both \nmales and females may be affected, the deficiency is classified as X-linked dominant. Although there is no proven treatment for PDHC  \ndeficiency, dietary restriction of carbohydrate and supplementation with thiamine may reduce symptoms in select patients.\n 5. Arsenic poisoning:  As previously described (see p. 197), pentava-\nlent arsenic (arsenate) can interfere with glycolysis at the glycer-\naldehyde 3-phosphate  step, thereby decreasing ATP production. \nHowever, arsenic poisoning is due primarily to inhibition of enzyme complexes that require lipoic acid as a coenzyme, including PDH, \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase  (see E. below), and branched-\nchain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase  (see p. 401). Arsenite (the triva-\nlent form of arsenic) forms a stable complex with the thiol (\u2212SH) groups of lipoic acid, making that compound unavailable to serve as a coenzyme. When it binds to lipoic acid in the PDHC , pyruvate \n(and, consequently, lactate) accumulates. As with PDHC  deficiency, \nthis particularly affects the brain, causing neurologic disturbances and death.\nB. Citrate synthesis\nThe irreversible condensation of acetyl CoA and OAA to form citrate (a tricarboxylic acid) is catalyzed by citrate synthase , the initiating PDH\nkinasePyruvate\nCa2+\nATPADP\nH2O\nPiPyruvate\ndehydrogenase\ncomplex\n(active)P\nATP\nAcetyl CoA\nNADHPyruvate\ndehydrogenase\ncomplex\n(inactive)+\n+P\nPDH\nphosphatase\nPyruvate Acetyl CoANADH\nCO2\nFigure 14.3\nRegulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase  \n(PDH) complex . PP = phosphate [  \ndenotes product inhibition.]Deficiencies of thiamine or \nniacin can cause serious central nervous system prob-lems. This is because brain cells are unable to produce sufficient ATP (via the TCA cycle) if the PDHC  is inac-\ntive. Wernicke-Korsakoff, an encephalopathy-psychosis syndrome due to thiamine deficiency, may be seen with alcohol abuse (see p. 530).\nLeigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelop-athy) is a rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in mito-chondrial ATP production, primarily as a result of muta-tions in genes that encode proteins of the PDHC , the \nETC, or ATP synthase . Both \nnuclear and mitochondrial DNA can be affected.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   208 24-10-2020   12:08:41"

This aldol condensation has a \nhighly negative change in standard free energy ([ \u0394G0], see p. 160), \nwhich strongly favors citrate formation. The enzyme is inhibited by citrate (product inhibition). Substrate availability is another means of regulation for citrate synthase . The binding of OAA greatly increases the \nenzyme\u2019s affinity for acetyl CoA. [Note: Citrate, in addition to being an intermediate in the TCA cycle, is a source of acetyl CoA for the cyto-solic synthesis of fatty acids (see p. 300) and cholesterol (see p. 343). Citrate also inhibits phosphofructokinase-1  (PFK-1 ), the rate-limiting \nenzyme of glycolysis (see p. 195), and activates acetyl CoA carbox-\nylase  (the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, see p. 301).]\nC. Citrate isomerization\nCitrate is isomerized to isocitrate through hydroxyl group migration \ncatalyzed by aconitase  (aconitate hydratase ), an iron-sulfur protein (see \nFig. 14.4 ). [Note: Aconitase  is inhibited by fluoroacetate, a plant toxin \nthat is used as a pesticide. Fluoroacetate is converted to fluoroacetyl CoA that condenses with OAA to form fluorocitrate, a potent inhibitor of aconitase .]\nD. Oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate\nIsocitrate dehydrogenase  catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarbox-\nylation of isocitrate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, yielding the first of three NADH \nmolecules produced by the cycle and the first release of CO 2 (see \nFig. 14.4 ). This is one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle. The \nenzyme is allosterically activated by ADP (a low-energy signal) and Ca2+ \nand is inhibited by ATP and NADH, levels of which are elevated when the cell has abundant energy stores.\nE. Oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate\nThe irreversible conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA is cata-\nlyzed by the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex , a protein aggre-\ngate of multiple copies of three enzymes ( Fig. 14.5 ). The mechanism \nof this oxidative decarboxylation is very similar to that used for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA by the PDHC . The reaction \nreleases the second CO\n2 and produces the second NADH of the cycle. \nThe coenzymes required are TPP , lipoic acid, FAD, NAD+, and CoA. \nEach functions as part of the catalytic mechanism in a way analogous to that described for the PDHC  (see p. 207). The large negative \u0394G\n0 of \nthe reaction favors formation of succinyl CoA, a high-energy thioester similar to acetyl CoA. The \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex  is \ninhibited by its products, NADH and succinyl CoA, and activated by Ca\n2+. However, it is not regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphoryla-\ntion reactions as described for the PDHC . [Note: \u03b1-Ketoglutarate is also \nproduced by the oxidative deamination (see p. 384) and transamination of the amino acid glutamate (see p. 382).]\nF. Succinyl coenzyme A cleavage\nSuccinate thiokinase  (also called succinyl CoA synthetase , named \nfor the reverse reaction) cleaves the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl CoA (see \nFig. 14.5 ). This reaction is coupled to phosphoryla-\ntion of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

It can be converted to pyruvate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 216) or used in heme synthesis (see p. 416).]\nG. Succinate oxidation\nSuccinate is oxidized to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase , as its \ncoenzyme FAD is reduced to FADH 2 (see Fig. 14.5 ). Succinate dehy-\ndrogenase  is the only enzyme of the TCA cycle that is embedded in \nthe inner mitochondrial membrane. As such, it functions as Complex II of the ETC (see p. 165). [Note: FAD, rather than NAD\n+, is the electron \nacceptor because the reducing power of succinate is not sufficient to reduce NAD\n+.]\nH. Fumarate hydration\nFumarate is hydrated to malate in a freely reversible reaction catalyzed by fumarase  (fumarate hydratase , see \nFig. 14.5 ). [Note: Fumarate is \nalso produced by the urea cycle (see p. 385), in purine synthesis (see Fig. 34.7 on p. 577), and during catabolism of the amino acids phenyl-alanine and tyrosine (see p. 398).]\nI. Malate oxidation\nMalate is oxidized to OAA by malate dehydrogenase  (Fig. 14.6 ). This \nreaction produces the third and final NADH of the cycle. The \u0394G0 of \nthe reaction is positive, but the reaction is driven in the direction of OAA by the highly exergonic citrate synthase  reaction. [Note: OAA is \nalso produced by the transamination of the amino acid aspartic acid (see p. 382).]\nIII. ENERGY PRODUCED BY THE CYCLE\nFour pairs of electrons are transferred during one turn of the TCA cycle: three pairs reducing three NAD\n+ to NADH and one pair reducing FAD to \nFADH 2. Oxidation of one NADH by the ETC leads to formation of three \nATP , whereas oxidation of FADH 2 produces two ATP (see p. 167). The total \nyield of ATP from the oxidation of one acetyl CoA is shown in Figure 14.7 . \nFigure 14.8  summarizes the reactions of the TCA cycle. [Note: The cycle \ndoes not involve the net consumption or production of intermediates. Two carbons entering as acetyl CoA are balanced by two CO\n2 exiting.]\nIV.

Chapter Summary\nPyruvate  is oxidatively decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase \ncomplex  (PDHC ), producing acetyl coenzyme A  (CoA), which is the \nmajor fuel for the tricarboxylic acid  (TCA) cycle  (Fig. 14.9 ). The multi-\nenzyme PDHC  requires five coenzymes: thiamine pyrophosphate , lipoic \nacid, flavin adenine dinucleotide  (FAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucle-\notide  (NAD+), and CoA. The PDHC  is regulated by covalent modification \nof E1 (pyruvate decarboxylase ) by PDH kinase  and PDH phosphatase : \nPhosphorylation inhibits E1. PDH kinase  is allosterically activated by ATP , \nacetyl CoA, and NADH and inhibited by pyruvate. The phosphatase  is acti-\nvated by calcium (Ca2+). E1 deficiency  is the most common biochemical \ncause of congenital lactic acidosis . The brain is particularly affected in \nthis X-linked dominant  disorder. Arsenic poisoning  causes inactivation \nof the PDHC  by binding to lipoic acid. In the TCA cycle, citrate  is synthe-\nsized from oxaloacetate  (OAA ) and acetyl CoA  by citrate synthase , \nwhich is inhibited by product. Citrate is isomerized to isocitrate  by acon-\nitase  (aconitate hydratase ). Isocitrate is oxidatively decarboxylated by \nisocitrate dehydrogenase  to \u03b1-ketoglutarate , producing carbon dioxide  \n(CO 2) and NADH . The enzyme is inhibited by ATP and NADH and activated \nby adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Ca2+. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate is oxidatively \ndecarboxylated to succinyl CoA  by the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase \ncomplex , producing CO 2 and NADH. The enzyme is very similar to the \nPDHC  and uses the same coenzymes. The \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydroge-\nnase complex  is activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by NADH and succinyl \nCoA but is not covalently regulated. Succinyl CoA is cleaved by succinate \nthiokinase  (also called succinyl CoA synthetase ), producing succinate  \nand guanosine triphosphate ( GTP). This is an example of substrate-level \nphosphorylation . Succinate is oxidized to fumarate  by succinate dehy-\ndrogenase , producing FADH 2. Fumarate is hydrated to malate  by fuma-\nrase (fumarate hydratase ), and malate is oxidized to OAA by malate \ndehydrogenase , producing NADH . Three NADH  and one FADH 2 are \nproduced by one round of the TCA cycle. The generation of acetyl CoA by the oxidation of pyruvate via the PDHC  also produces an NADH. Oxidation \nof the NADH and FADH\n2 by the ETC yields 14 ATP . The terminal phos-\nphate of the GTP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in the TCA cycle can be transferred to ADP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase , yielding \nanother ATP . Therefore, a total of 15 ATP are produced from the complete mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate to CO\n2.Acetyl CoA\nCitrate\nIsocitrate\n-Ketoglutarate\u03b1\nSuccinyl CoASuccinateOxaloacetate\nMalate\nFumarateADP\nCa2+\nNADH\nSuccinyl CoANADH\nATPCitrate \nsynthase\nIsocitrate\ndehydro-\ngenase\na-Keto-\nglutarate\ndehydrogenase\ncomplexB+\n+\nCa2+Acetyl CoA\nCitrate\nIsocitrate\n-Ketoglutarate\u03b1\nSuccinyl CoASuccinateOxaloacetate\nMalate\nFumarateCO2\nNAD+NAD+\nNAD+\nGTP GDP + Pi(ATP)\ncetyl Co A\nCitrate\nIsocitrattee\n-Ketoglutuarate\n \u03b1\nCCCOCO\n2\nNAD\n+Two molecules of \nCO2 are released.\nS\nSuccinat e\nFumarate\nGTP\n(ATP)\nFour reduced coenzyme\nmolecules produced peracetyl CoA are oxidizedto CO\n2.\nGDP + P\ni\nzyme\nd per\ndized\nA\nAc\nSubstrate-level \nphosphorylationoccurs.CoAA\nTwo carbon \natoms enter the cycle.\nCO2\nFAD3 NADH\nFADH2\nFigure 14.8\nA.

OVERVIEW\nBioenergetics describes the transfer and utilization of energy in biologic \nsystems. It concerns the initial and final energy states of the reaction \ncomponents, not the reaction mechanism or how much time it takes for the \nchemical change to occur. Bioenergetics makes use of a few basic ideas \nfrom the field of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy. \nBecause changes in free energy provide a measure of the energetic feasi-\nbility of a chemical reaction, they allow prediction of whether a reaction \nor process can take place. In short, bioenergetics predicts if a process is \npossible, whereas kinetics measures the reaction rate (see p. 136).\nII. FREE ENERGY\nThe direction and extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds are deter-\nmined by the degree to which two factors change during the reaction. \nThese are enthalpy ( \u0394H, a measure of the change [ \u0394] in heat content of \nthe reactants and products) and entropy ( \u0394S, a measure of the change \nin randomness or disorder of the reactants and products), as shown in \nFigure 11.1 . Neither of these thermodynamic quantities by itself is suffi-\ncient to determine whether a chemical reaction will proceed spontaneously \nin the direction it is written. However, when combined mathematically (see \nFig. 11.1 ), enthalpy and entropy can be used to define a third quantity, free \nenergy (G), which predicts the direction in which a reaction will spontane-\nously proceed.Learning Objectives\nAfter going through this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the factors that makes biochemical reaction spontaneous and \nthermodynamically favorable \n\u2022 Describe the process of ATP biosynthesis by oxidative phosphorylation\n\u2022 List the inhibitors of ATP biosynthesis by oxidative phosphorylation\n\u2022 Explain the role of mitochondria in apoptosis and mutation of mito-\nchondrial DNA in pathogenesis of myopathies\n\u0394G = \u0394H   T \u0394S\u0394H: CHANGE IN ENTHALPY  \n\u2022 Heat released or absorbed\n   during a reaction\n\u2022 Does not predict whether a \n   reaction is favorable\n\u0394S: CHANGE IN ENTROPY  \n\u2022 Measure of randomness \n\u2022 Does not predict whether a \n   reaction is favorable\n\u0394\nH: CHAN GE IN ENTHALPY \n\u2022\nHeat released or absorbe d\n   dur ing a react ion\n\u2022\nDoes not pred ict whether a\n   reaction is favorabl e\n\u0394\nG = \n\u0394\nH   T\n\u0394\nS\n \u0394\u0394\nG=\n \u0394\nHT\n\u0394\nS\n\u0394G: CHANGE IN FREE ENERGY  \n\u2022 Energy available to do work\n\u2022 Approaches zero as reaction \n   proceeds to equilibrium\n\u2022 Predicts whether a reaction is \n   favorable\nFigure 11.1\nRelationship between changes in free \nenergy (G), enthalpy (H), and entropy (S).  \nT is the absolute temperature in Kelvin \n(K), where K = \u00b0C + 273.\n15 Gluconeogenesis \nI. OVERVIEW\nGluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is made from non-\ncarbohydrate precursors like lactate, glucogenic amino acids, glycerol, \nand propionyl CoA. It happens mainly in liver but also in renal cortex. \nGluconeogenesis is not a simple reversal of glycolysis, since the irrevers-\nible steps of glycolysis have to be circumvented. Some tissues, such as \nthe brain, red blood cells (RBC), kidney medulla, lens and cornea of the \neye, testes, and exercising muscle, require a continuous supply of glucose \nas a metabolic fuel. Liver glycogen, an essential postprandial source of \nglucose, can meet these needs for <24 hours in the absence of dietary \nintake of carbohydrate (see p. 226). During a prolonged fast, however, \nhepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and glucose is made from noncar-\nbohydrate precursors. The formation of glucose does not occur by a simple \nreversal of glycolysis, because the overall equilibrium of glycolysis strongly \nfavors pyruvate formation (that is, the change in standard free energy \n[\u0394G0] is negative). Instead, glucose is synthesized de novo by a special \npathway, gluconeogenesis, which requires both mitochondrial and cyto-\nsolic enzymes. [Note: Deficiencies of gluconeogenic enzymes cause hypo-\nglycemia.] During an overnight fast, ~90% of gluconeogenesis occurs in the \nliver, with the remaining ~10% occurring in the kidneys. However, during \nprolonged fasting, the kidneys become major glucose-producing organs, \ncontributing ~40% of the total glucose production.

            "Text": "15 Gluconeogenesis \nI. OVERVIEW\nGluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is made from non-\ncarbohydrate precursors like lactate, glucogenic amino acids, glycerol, and propionyl CoA. It happens mainly in liver but also in renal cortex. Gluconeogenesis is not a simple reversal of glycolysis, since the irrevers-ible steps of glycolysis have to be circumvented. Some tissues, such as the brain, red blood cells (RBC), kidney medulla, lens and cornea of the eye, testes, and exercising muscle, require a continuous supply of glucose as a metabolic fuel. Liver glycogen, an essential postprandial source of glucose, can meet these needs for <24 hours in the absence of dietary intake of carbohydrate (see p. 226). During a prolonged fast, however, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and glucose is made from noncar-bohydrate precursors. The formation of glucose does not occur by a simple reversal of glycolysis, because the overall equilibrium of glycolysis strongly favors pyruvate formation (that is, the change in standard free energy [\u0394G\n0] is negative). Instead, glucose is synthesized de novo by a special \npathway, gluconeogenesis, which requires both mitochondrial and cyto-solic enzymes. [Note: Deficiencies of gluconeogenic enzymes cause hypo-glycemia.] During an overnight fast, ~90% of gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver, with the remaining ~10% occurring in the kidneys. However, during prolonged fasting, the kidneys become major glucose-producing organs, contributing ~40% of the total glucose production. [Note: The small intes-tine can also make glucose.] \nFigure 15.1  shows the relationship of gluco-\nneogenesis to other essential pathways of energy metabolism.\nII.

Glycerol\nGlycerol is released during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) in adipose tissue (see p. 307) and is delivered by the blood to the liver. Glycerol is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase  to glycerol 3-phosphate, \nwhich is oxidized by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  to dihydroxy-\nacetone phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.\nB. Lactate\nLactate from anaerobic glycolysis is released into the blood by exer-cising skeletal muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which is released back into the circulation (\nFig. 15.2 ).\nC. Amino acids\nAmino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates \u03b1-keto \nacids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate \nthat can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  (PDHC ), which converts pyruvate to \nacetyl CoA (see p. 207). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p. 313) and are termed ketogenic.]\nIII. REACTIONS\nSeven glycolytic reactions are reversible and are used in the synthesis of glucose from lactate or pyruvate. However, three glycolytic reactions are irreversible and must be circumvented by four alternate reactions that ener-getically favor the synthesis of glucose. These irreversible reactions, which together are unique to gluconeogenesis, are described below.\nA. Pyruvate carboxylation\nThe first roadblock to overcome in the synthesis of glucose from pyru-vate is the irreversible conversion in glycolysis of PEP to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK).  In gluconeogenesis, pyruvate is carboxylated \nby pyruvate carboxylase (PC)  to OAA, which is converted to PEP by \nPEP-carboxykinase  (PEPCK ) (\nFig. 15.3 ).\n 1. Biotin:  PC requires the coenzyme biotin (see p. 533) covalently \nbound to the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue in the enzyme (see \nFig. 15.3 ). ATP hydrolysis drives formation of an enzyme\u2013biotin\u2013\ncarbon dioxide (CO 2) intermediate, which then carboxylates pyru-\nvate to form OAA. [Note: HCO 3\u2212 provides the CO 2.] The PC reaction \noccurs in the mitochondria of liver and kidney cells and has two purposes: to allow production of PEP , an important substrate for Lactate\nLactate\nGlucoseMUSCLEBLOOD\nLactateGlucose\nGlucoseLIVER\nFigure 15.2\nThe intertissue Cori cycle links \ngluconeogenesis with glycolysis.

Others \ninclude acetyl CoA carboxylase  (p. 183), propionyl CoA carbox-\nylase  (p. 194), and methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase  (p. 266).\n 2. Allosteric regulation:  PC is allosterically activated by acetyl CoA. \nElevated levels of acetyl CoA in mitochondria signal a metabolic state in which increased synthesis of OAA is required. For example, this occurs during fasting, when OAA is used for gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys. Conversely, at low levels of acetyl CoA, PC \nis largely inactive, and pyruvate is primarily oxidized by the PDHC  to \nacetyl CoA that can be further oxidized by the TCA cycle (see p. 207).\nB.

The reaction is driven by hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate \n([GTP], see \nFig. 15.3 ). The combined actions of PC and PEPCK  provide \nan energetically favorable pathway from pyruvate to PEP . PEP is then acted on by the reactions of glycolysis running in the reverse direction until it becomes fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.\nThe pairing of carboxylation with decarboxylation drives reac-\ntions that would otherwise be energetically unfavorable. This strategy is also used in fatty acid (FA) synthesis (see p. 301).\nD. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate dephosphorylation\nHydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase , \nfound in the liver and kidneys, bypasses the irreversible phosphofruc-\ntokinase-1  (PFK-1 ) reaction of glycolysis and provides an energetically \nfavorable pathway for the formation of fructose 6-phosphate ( Fig. 15.4 ). \nThis reaction is an important regulatory site of gluconeogenesis.\n 1. Regulation by intracellular energy levels:  Fructose 1,6-bispho-\nsphatase  is inhibited by a rise in the adenosine monophosphate \n(AMP)/ATP ratio, which signals a low-energy state in the cell. Conversely, low AMP and high ATP levels stimulate gluconeogen-esis, an energy-requiring pathway.\n 2. Regulation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate:  Fructose 1,6- bispho-\nsphatase  is inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric \neffector whose concentration is influenced by the insulin/glucagon ratio. When glucagon is high, the effector is not made by hepatic PFK-2  (see p. 195), and thus, the phosphatase  is active (\nFig. 15.5 ). \n[Note: The signals that inhibit (low energy, high fructose 2,6-bispho-sphate) or activate (high energy, low fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) gluconeogenesis have the opposite effect on glycolysis, providing reciprocal control of the pathways that synthesize and oxidize glucose (see p. 196).]\nE.

[Note: These ER membrane \nproteins are also required for the final step of glycogen degradation (see p. 231). Glycogen storage diseases Ia and Ib, caused by deficiencies in the phosphatase  and the translocase, respectively, are character-\nized by severe fasting hypoglycemia, because free glucose is unable to be produced from either gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis.] Specific transporters are responsible for moving the free glucose into the cytosol and then into blood.\nF.

REGULATION\nThe moment-to-moment regulation of gluconeogenesis is determined primarily by the circulating level of glucagon and by the availability of gluco-neogenic substrates. In addition, slow adaptive changes in enzyme amount result from an alteration in the rate of enzyme synthesis or degradation or both. [Note: Hormonal control of the glucoregulatory system is presented in Chapter 27.]\nA. Glucagon\nThis peptide hormone from pancreatic islet \u03b1 cells (see p. 441) stimu-\nlates gluconeogenesis by three mechanisms.\n 1. Changes in allosteric effectors:  Glucagon lowers hepatic fructose \n2,6-bisphosphate, resulting in fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase  activa-\ntion and PFK-1  inhibition, thereby favoring gluconeogenesis over \nglycolysis (see Fig. 15.5 ). [Note: See p. 195 for the role of fructose \n2,6-bisphosphate in glycolysis regulation.]\n 2. Covalent modification of enzyme activity:  Glucagon binds its G \nprotein\u2013coupled receptor (see p. 190) and, via an elevation in cyclic AMP (cAMP) level and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A  activity, \nstimulates the conversion of hepatic PK to its inactive (phosphory-\nlated) form. This decreases PEP conversion to pyruvate, which has the effect of diverting PEP to gluconeogenesis (\nFig. 15.8 ).\n 3. Induction of enzyme synthesis:  Glucagon increases transcription \nof the gene for PEPCK  via the transcription factor cAMP response \nelement\u2013binding (CREB) protein, thereby increasing the availability of this enzyme as levels of its substrate rise during fasting. [Note: Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) also increases expression of the gene, whereas insulin decreases expression.]\nB. Substrate availability\nThe availability of gluconeogenic precursors, particularly glucogenic amino acids, significantly influences the rate of glucose synthesis. Decreased insulin levels favor mobilization of amino acids from muscle protein to provide the carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis. The ATP and NADH coenzymes required for gluconeogenesis are primarily provided by FA oxidation.\nC. Allosteric activation by acetyl CoA\nAllosteric activation of hepatic PC by acetyl CoA occurs during fasting. \nAs a result of increased TAG hydrolysis in adipose tissue, the liver is flooded with FA (see p. 460). The rate of formation of acetyl CoA by \u03b2-oxidation of these FA exceeds the capacity of the liver to oxidize it \nto CO\n2 and water. As a result, acetyl CoA accumulates and activates \nPC. [Note: Acetyl CoA inhibits the PDHC  (by activating PDH kinase ; see \np. 208). Thus, this single compound can divert pyruvate toward gluco-neogenesis and away from the TCA cycle (\nFig. 15.9 ).]2 GDP \n2 GTP 2 OxaloacetateGlucose 6-P Glucose \nFructose 6-P\nFructose 1,6-bis-P\nGlyceraldehyde 3-P\n2 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate\n2 3-Phosphoglycerate\n2 2-Phosphoglycerate\n2 Phosphoenolpyruvate\n2 PyruvateDihydroxy-\nacetone-P\nCO2234\n2 ADP + 2 Pi\n2 ATP2 ADP\n2 ATPPi2 NAD+\n2 NADH + 2 H+\n1\nFigure 15.7\nSummary of the reactions of glycolysis \nand gluconeogenesis, showing the energy requirements of gluconeogenesis.

Chapter Summary\nGluconeogenic precursors  include glycerol  released during triacylglyc-\nerol hydrolysis in adipose tissue, lactate  released by cells that lack mito-\nchondria and by exercising skeletal muscle, and \u03b1-keto acids  (for example, \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate  and pyruvate ) derived from glucogenic amino acid \nmetabolism ( Fig. 15.10 ).

It is also inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphos-\nphate , the primary allosteric activator of glycolysis. Glucose 6-phosphate  \nis dephosphorylated to glucose  by glucose 6-phosphatase . This enzyme \nof the endoplasmic reticular membrane catalyzes the final step in gluco-neogenesis and in glycogen degradation. Its deficiency results in severe, fasting hypoglycemia.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   222 24-10-2020   12:08:49"

CYCLE OVERVIEW\nThe tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or \nthe Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway \nwhere the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty \nacids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide \n(CO2), as shown in Figure 14.1 . This oxidation provides energy for the \nproduction of the majority of ATP in most animals, including humans. \nBecause the TCA cycle occurs totally in mitochondria, it is in close prox-\nimity to the electron transport chain ([ETC], see p. 163), which oxidizes \nthe reduced coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and \nflavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2) produced by the cycle. The TCA cycle \nis an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O 2) is required as the final elec-\ntron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids \ngenerate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the \nGreek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermedi-\nates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as glucose forma-\ntion from the carbon skeletons of some amino acids and the synthesis of \nsome amino acids (see p. 402) and heme (see p. 415). Therefore, this cycle \nshould not be viewed as a closed system but, instead, as an open one with  \ncompounds entering and leaving as required.\nII.

This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stim-ulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio. Fatty acid degradation yields acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), which cannot be converted to glucose. This is because there is no net gain of carbons from acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase  complex is phys-\niologically irreversible.

This lactate also increases in blood and is taken up by liver to convert it to pyruvate via the Cori cycle. This process of conversion of lactate to pyruvate requires NAD\n+.

Additionally, the reversible reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase  \nis driven to lactate by NADH. Thus, two important gluco-neogenic substrates, OAA and pyruvate, decrease as a result of the increase in NADH during ethanol metabolism. Consequently, gluconeogenesis decreases.15.5.

            "Text": "16Glycogen Metabolism \nand Glycogen Storage Disorders\nI. OVERVIEW\nA constant source of blood glucose is an absolute requirement for human \nlife. Glucose is the greatly preferred energy source for the brain and the required energy source for cells with few or no mitochondria such as mature red blood cells. Glucose is also essential as an energy source for exercising muscle, where it is the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and mono-saccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reli-able source of blood glucose. In contrast, gluconeogenesis (see p. 216) can provide sustained synthesis of glucose, but it is somewhat slow in responding to a falling blood glucose level. Therefore, the body has devel-oped mechanisms for storing a supply of glucose in a rapidly mobilized form, namely, glycogen. In the absence of a dietary source of glucose, this sugar is rapidly released into the blood from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo, using glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 15). \nFigure 16.1  shows the reactions of glycogen synthesis \nand degradation as part of the essential pathways of energy metabolism.\nII.

That of liver glycogen is to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during the early stages of a fast (\nFig. 16.2 ; also see p. 459). [Note: Liver glycogen can maintain blood \nglucose for <24 hours.]\nA. Amounts in liver and muscle\nApproximately 400 g of glycogen make up 1%\u20132% of the fresh weight of resting muscle, and ~100 g of glycogen make up to 10% of the fresh weight of a well-fed adult liver. What limits the production of glycogen at these levels is not clear. However, in some glycogen storage diseases (GSD) (see \nFig. 16.8 ), the amount of glycogen in the liver and/or muscle \ncan be significantly higher. [Note: In the body, muscle mass is greater than liver mass. Consequently, most of the body\u2019s glycogen is found in skeletal muscle.]\nB. Structure\nGlycogen is a branched-chain polysaccharide made exclusively from \u03b1-\nD-glucose. The primary glycosidic bond is an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage. After \nan average of 8\u201314 glucosyl residues, there is a branch containing an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage (\nFig. 16.3 ). A single glycogen molecule can contain up \nto 55,000 glucosyl residues. These polymers of glucose exist as large, spherical, cytoplasmic granules (particles) that also contain most of the enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis and degradation.\nC. Glycogen store fluctuation\nLiver glycogen stores increase during the well-fed state (see p. 453) and are depleted during a fast (see p. 459). Muscle glycogen is not affected by short periods of fasting (a few days) and is only moder-ately decreased in prolonged fasting (weeks). Muscle glycogen is synthesized to replenish muscle stores after they have been depleted following strenuous exercise. [Note: Glycogen synthesis and degra-dation go on continuously. The difference between the rates of these two processes determines the levels of stored glycogen during specific physiologic states.]\nIII. SYNTHESIS (GLYCOGENESIS)\nGlycogen is synthesized from molecules of \u03b1-D-glucose. The process \noccurs in the cytosol and requires energy supplied by ATP (for the phos-phorylation of glucose) and uridine triphosphate (UTP).\nA. Uridine diphosphate glucose synthesis\n\u03b1-D-Glucose attached to uridine diphosphate (UDP) is the source of all \nthe glucosyl residues that are added to the growing glycogen molecule. UDP-glucose (\nFig. 16.4 ) is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate and \nUTP by UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase  (Fig. 16.5 ). Pyrophosphate \n(PP i), the second product of the reaction, is hydrolyzed to two inor-\nganic phosphates (P i) by pyrophosphatase . The hydrolysis is exergonic, \ninsuring that the UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase  reaction proceeds in \nthe direction of UDP-glucose production.

Primer requirement and synthesis\nGlycogen synthase  makes the \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages in glycogen. This enzyme \ncannot initiate chain synthesis using free glucose as an acceptor of a molecule of glucose from UDP-glucose. Instead, it can only elongate already existing chains of glucose and, therefore, requires a primer. A fragment of glycogen can serve as a primer. In the absence of a frag-ment, the homodimeric protein glycogenin  can serve as an acceptor \nof glucose from UDP-glucose (see \nFig. 16.5 ). The side-chain hydroxyl \ngroup of tyrosine-194 in the protein is the site at which the initial glucosyl unit is attached. Because the reaction is catalyzed by glyco-\ngenin  itself via autoglucosylation, glycogenin  is an enzyme. Glycogenin  \nthen catalyzes the transfer of at least four molecules of glucose from UDP-glucose, producing a short, \u03b1(1\u21924)-linked glucosyl chain. This \nshort chain serves as a primer that is able to be elongated by glycogen \nsynthase , which is recruited by glycogenin , as described in C. below. \n[Note: Glycogenin  stays associated with and forms the core of a \nglycogen granule.]\nC. Elongation by glycogen synthase\nElongation of a glycogen chain involves the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the nonreducing end of the growing chain, forming a new glycosidic bond between the anomeric hydroxyl group of carbon 1 of the activated glucose and carbon 4 of the accepting glucosyl residue UDP-Glucose\nOCH2OH\nOH\nOHH\nHHH\nOHO\nO\u2013P OO\nO\nO\u2013PC\nC C\nC CCH2 O\nH\nOHHHNN\nCC\nCCO\nH\nGlucose  Uridine diphosphate\n(UDP)HC C\nC C\nOHOH\nHOH\nFigure 16.4\nThe structure of UDP-glucose, a \nnucleotide sugar.\nGLYCOGENFurther branching,\nmaking a(1\u21926) bonds.Further elongation at the nonreducing ends \nby glycogen synthase , making a(1\u21924) bonds.o\nn\nm\nl\nk\nj\ni h f edcbaBranching\nenzymeGlycogensynthase\nNONREDUCING\nENDSUDPHOTyrosine-194\nGlycogeninGlucose 1-phosphate\nUDP-glucose\npyrophosphorylase\nPyrophosphataseUDP-glucose\n(UDP -    )\nH2O\n2 PiPPi\na(1\u21926) bond\na(1\u21924) bonds\non ml k j i hgfedcbaGlucose 6-phosphate\nPhosphoglucomutase\nO\nOOUDPUDP-glucose\n(UDP -    )UTP \n4:6 transferase\nFigure 16.5\nGlycogen synthesis.

[Note: The nonreducing end of a carbohydrate chain is \none in which the anomeric carbon of the terminal sugar is linked by a glycosidic bond to another molecule, making the terminal sugar nonre-ducing (see p. 177).] The enzyme responsible for making the \u03b1(1\u21924) \nlinkages in glycogen is glycogen synthase . [Note: The UDP released \nwhen the new \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bond is made can be phosphorylated \nto UTP by nucleoside diphosphate kinase  (UDP + ATP \n UTP + ADP; \nsee p. 578).]\nD. Branch formation\nIf no other synthetic enzyme acted on the chain, the resulting struc-ture would be a linear (unbranched) chain of glucosyl residues attached by \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages. Such a compound is found in plant tissues and \nis called amylose. In contrast, glycogen has branches located, on average, eight glucosyl residues apart, resulting in a highly branched, tree-like structure (see \nFig. 16.3 ) that is far more soluble than the \nunbranched amylose. Branching also increases the number of nonre-ducing ends to which new glucosyl residues can be added (and also, as described in IV. below, from which these residues can be removed), thereby greatly accelerating the rate at which glycogen synthesis can occur and dramatically increasing the size of the glycogen molecule.\n 1. Branch synthesis:  Branches are made by the action of the \nbranching enzyme, amylo- \u03b1(1\u21924)\u2192\u03b1(1\u21926)-transglycosylase . This \nenzyme removes a set of six to eight glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of the glycogen chain, breaking an \u03b1(1\u21924) bond \nto another residue on the chain, and attaches it to a nonterminal glucosyl residue by an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage, thus functioning as a 4:6 \ntransferase . The resulting new, nonreducing end (see \u201ci\u201d in \nFig. 16.5 ), \nas well as the old nonreducing end from which the six to eight resi-dues were removed (see \u201co\u201d in \nFig. 16.5 ), can now be further elon-\ngated by glycogen synthase .\n 2. Additional branch synthesis:  After elongation of these two ends \nhas been accomplished, their terminal six to eight glucosyl residues can be removed and used to make additional branches.\nIV. DEGRADATION (GLYCOGENOLYSIS)\nThe degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skel-etal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic reactions. Instead, a sepa-rate set of cytosolic enzymes is required. When glycogen is degraded, the primary product is glucose 1-phosphate, obtained by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) \nglycosidic bonds. In addition, free glucose is released from each \u03b1(1\u21926)\u2013\nlinked glucosyl residue (branch point).\nA. Chain shortening\nGlycogen phosphorylase  sequentially cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic \nbonds between the glucosyl residues at the nonreducing ends of the glycogen chains by simple phosphorolysis (producing glucose 1-phos-phate) until four glucosyl units remain on each chain at a branch point (\nFig. 16.7 ). The resulting structure is called a limit dextrin, and phosphor-\nylase  cannot degrade it any further ( Fig. 16.8 ).

There, it is dephosphorylated to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase  (the \nsame enzyme used in the last step of gluconeogenesis; see p. 219). The glucose is then transported from the ER to the cytosol. Hepatocytes release glycogen-derived glucose into the blood to help maintain blood glucose levels until the gluconeogenic pathway is actively producing glucose.

            "Text": "V. Glycogenesis and Glycogenolysis Regulation 233\nV.  GLYCOGENESIS AND GLYCOGENOLYSIS \nREGULATION\nBecause of the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels, the \nsynthesis and degradation of its glycogen storage form are tightly regu-lated. In the liver, glycogenesis accelerates during periods when the body has been well fed, whereas glycogenolysis accelerates during periods of fasting. In skeletal muscle, glycogenolysis occurs during active exercise, and glycogenesis begins as soon as the muscle is again at rest. Regulation of synthesis and degradation is accomplished on two levels. First, glycogen \nsynthase  and glycogen phosphorylase  are hormonally regulated (by cova-\nlent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) to meet the needs of the body as a whole. Second, these same enzymes are allosterically regulated (by effector molecules) to meet the needs of a particular tissue.\nA. Covalent activation of glycogenolysis\nThe binding of hormones, such as glucagon or epinephrine, to plasma membrane G protein\u2013coupled receptors ([GPCR], see p. 190) signals the need for glycogen to be degraded, either to elevate blood glucose levels or to provide energy for exercising muscle.\n 1. Protein kinase  A activation:  Binding of glucagon or epinephrine \nto their specific hepatocyte GPCR, or of epinephrine to a specific myocyte GPCR, results in the G protein\u2013mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase . This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic \nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates cAMP-depen-\ndent protein kinase A  (PKA). cAMP binds the two regulatory subunits \nof tetrameric PKA, releasing two individual catalytic subunits that \nare active (\nFig. 16.9 ; also see p. 190). PKA then phosphorylates \nseveral enzymes of glycogen metabolism, affecting their activity. [Note: When cAMP is removed, the inactive tetramer reforms.]\n 2. Phosphorylase kinase  activation:  Phosphorylase kinase  exists \nin two forms: an inactive \u201cb\u201d form and an active \u201ca\u201d form. Active PKA phosphorylates the inactive \u201cb\u201d form of phosphorylase kinase , \nproducing the active \u201ca\u201d form (see \nFig. 16.9 ).\n 3. Glycogen phosphorylase activation:  Glycogen phosphorylase  \nalso exists in a dephosphorylated, inactive \u201cb\u201d form and a phos-phorylated, active \u201ca\u201d form. Phosphorylase kinase a  is the only \nenzyme that phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b  to its active \n\u201ca\u201d form, which then begins glycogenolysis (see \nFig. 16.9 ).\n 4. Signal amplification:  The cascade of reactions described above \nactivates glycogenolysis. The large number of sequential steps serves to amplify the effect of the hormonal signal (that is, a few hormone molecules binding to their GPCR result in a number of PKA \nmolecules being activated that can each activate many phosphor-\nylase kinase  molecules). This causes the production of many active \nglycogen phosphorylase a  molecule that can degrade glycogen.\n 5. Phosphorylated state maintenance:  The phosphate groups added \nto phosphorylase kinase  and phosphorylase  in response to cAMP \nare maintained because the enzyme that hydrolytically removes the phosphate, protein phosphatase-1  (PP1), is inactivated by inhibitor \nproteins that are also phosphorylated and activated in response to GLYCOGEN\nSYNTHESIS\nIS\nINHIBITEDGlycogen\nsynthase b\n(inactive)Glycogen\nsynthase a\n(active)ATPPhospho-\ndiesterase\ncAMP-dependent\nprotein kinase A\n(inactive)\ncAMP-dependent \nprotein kinase A\n(active)\nProtein phosphatase-1ADP\nPiH2O5\u02b9-AMP\n+RCC\nRCCR\nR\nCCR\nRR cAMP (  )Active\nadenylylcyclasePP\ni\nPInsulin \n+ATPGlucagon\n(LIVER) Epinephrine\n(MUSCLE and LIVER)\nInsulin \n+\nFigure 16.10\nHormonal regulation of glycogen \nsynthesis.

Because insulin also activates \nthe phosphodiesterase  that degrades cAMP , it opposes the effects \nof glucagon and epinephrine.]\nB. Covalent inhibition of glycogenesis\nThe regulated enzyme in glycogenesis, glycogen synthase , also exists \nin two forms, the active \u201ca\u201d form and the inactive \u201cb\u201d form. However, in contrast to phosphorylase kinase  and phosphorylase , the active form \nof glycogen synthase  is dephosphorylated, whereas the inactive form \nis phosphorylated at several sites on the enzyme, with the level of inactivation proportional to the degree of phosphorylation (\nFig. 16.10 ). \nPhosphorylation is catalyzed by several different protein kinases  in \nresponse to cAMP (for example, PKA and phosphorylase kinase ) or \nother signaling mechanisms (see C. below). Glycogen synthase b  can \nbe reconverted to the \u201ca\u201d form by PP1. Figure 16.11  summarizes the \ncovalent regulation of glycogen metabolism.\nC. Allosteric regulation of glycogenesis and glycogenolysis\nIn addition to hormonal signals, glycogen synthase  and glycogen phos-\nphorylase  respond to the levels of metabolites and energy needs of the \ncell. Glycogenesis is stimulated when glucose and energy levels are high, whereas glycogenolysis is increased when glucose and energy levels are low. This allosteric regulation allows a rapid response to the needs of a cell and can override the effects of hormone-mediated cova-lent regulation. [Note: The \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d forms of the allosteric enzymes of glycogen metabolism are each in an equilibrium between the R (relaxed, more active) and T (tense, less active) conformations (see p. 106). The binding of effectors shifts the equilibrium and alters enzymic activity without directly altering the covalent modification.]\n 1. Regulation in the well-fed state:  In the well-fed state, glycogen \nsynthase b  in both liver and muscle is allosterically activated by \nglucose 6-phosphate, which is present in elevated concentrations (\nFig. 16.12 ). In contrast, glycogen phosphorylase a  is allosterically \ninhibited by glucose 6-phosphate, as well as by ATP , a high-energy signal. [Note: In liver, but not muscle, free glucose is also an allo-steric inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase a .]\n 2. Glycogenolysis activation by AMP:  Muscle glycogen phosphory-\nlase (myophosphorylase ), but not the liver isozyme, is active in the \npresence of the high AMP concentrations that occur under extreme conditions of anoxia and ATP depletion. AMP binds to glycogen \nphosphorylase b , causing its activation without phosphorylation \n(see \nFig. 16.9 ). [Note: Recall that AMP also activates phosphofruc-\ntokinase-1  of glycolysis (see p. 195), allowing glucose from glyco-\ngenolysis to be oxidized.]\n 3.

Further, carbohydrate-rich meal will lead \nto deposition of fat via de novo synthesis.\nFasting releases glucose by breakdown of glycogen from liver. This is usually adequate up to 17 hours after which fat \nand protein breakdown starts as well as gluconeogenesis happens to ensure adequate supply of glucose to RBCs, brain, etc. (please see chapter 28 for details).\nGlycogen storage diseases are explained in \nFigure 16.8  and include Von Gierke disease (Type Ia), Pompe disease (Type II), \nCori disease (Type III), Andersen disease (Type IV) and McArdle Disease (Type V). \nVIII. Chapter Summary\nThe main stores of glycogen  in the body are found in skeletal muscle , where they serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis \nof ATP during muscle contraction , and in the liver, where they are used to maintain the blood glucose  concentration, \nparticularly during the early stages of a fast. Glycogen is a highly branched polymer  of \u03b1-D-glucose . The primary glyco-\nsidic bond is an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage . After about 8\u201314 glucosyl residues, there is a branch containing an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage . \nUridine diphosphate  (UDP )-glucose , the building block of glycogen, is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate  and \nUTP by UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase  (Fig. 16.14 ). Glucose  from UDP-glucose is transferred to the nonreducing \nends  of glycogen chains by primer-requiring glycogen synthase , which makes the \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages. The primer  is made \nby glycogenin . Branches are formed by amylo- \u03b1(1\u21924)\u2192\u03b1(1\u21926)-transglycosylase  (a 4:6 transferase ), which trans-\nfers a set of six to eight glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of the glycogen chain (breaking an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage), \nand making an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage to another residue in the chain. Pyridoxal phosphate\u2013requiring glycogen phosphorylase  \ncleaves the \u03b1(1\u21924) bonds between glucosyl residues at the nonreducing ends of the glycogen chains, producing glucose \n1-phosphate . This sequential degradation continues until four glucosyl units remain before a branch point. The resulting \nstructure is called a limit dextrin  that is degraded by the bifunctional debranching  enzyme. Oligo-\u03b1(1\u21924)\u2192\u03b1(1\u21924)-\nglucantransferase  (a 4:4 transferase ) activity removes the outer three of the four glucosyl residues at a branch and \ntransfers them to the nonreducing end of another chain, where they can be released as glucose 1-phosphate by glycogen \nphosphorylase . The remaining single glucose residue attached in an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage is removed hydrolytically by the \namylo- \u03b1(1\u21926) glucosidase  activity of debranching enzyme , releasing free glucose . Glucose 1-phosphate is converted \nto glucose 6-phosphate  by phosphoglucomutase . In muscle , glucose 6-phosphate enters glycolysis. In liver, the \nphosphate is removed by glucose 6-phosphatase  (an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular membrane), releasing free \nglucose that can be used to maintain blood glucose levels at the beginning of a fast. A deficiency of the phosphatase  \ncauses glycogen storage disease Ia  (von Gierke disease ) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose \nto the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen synthesis and degradation are reciprocally regulated  to meet whole-body needs by the same hormonal signals (namely, an elevated insulin  level \nresults in overall increased glycogenesis  and decreased glycogenolysis , whereas an elevated glucagon , or epineph-\nrine, level causes the opposite effects). Key enzymes are phosphorylated by a family of protein kinases , some of which \nare dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP ), a compound increased by glucagon and epinephrine. \nPhosphate groups are removed by protein phosphatase-1  (active when its inhibitor is inactive in response to elevated \ninsulin levels). In addition to this covalent regulation , glycogen synthase , phosphorylase kinase , and phosphory-\nlase are allosterically regulated  to meet tissues\u2019 needs. In the well-fed state, glycogen synthase  is activated by glucose \n6-phosphate, but glycogen phosphorylase  is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate as well as by ATP . In the liver, free glucose \nalso serves as an allosteric inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase . The rise in calcium  in muscle during exercise and in liver \nin response to epinephrine activates phosphorylase kinase  by binding to the enzyme\u2019s calmodulin  subunit. This allows \nthe enzyme to activate glycogen phosphorylase , thereby causing glycogen degradation. AMP  activates glycogen phos-\nphorylase  (myophosphorylase ) in muscle.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   236 24-10-2020   12:08:57"

Two other monosaccha-rides, fructose and galactose, also occur in significant amounts in the diet (primarily in disaccharides) and make important contributions to energy metabolism. In addition, galactose is an important component of glycosyl-ated proteins. \nFigure 17.1 shows the metabolism of fructose and galactose \nas part of the essential pathways of energy metabolism.\nII. FRUCTOSE METABOLISM\nAbout 10% of the calories in the Western diet are supplied by fructose (~55 g/day). The major source of fructose is the disaccharide sucrose, which, when cleaved in the intestine, releases equimolar amounts of fruc-tose and glucose. Fructose is also found as a free monosaccharide in many fruits, in honey, and in high-fructose corn syrup (typically, 55% fructose and 45% glucose), which is used to sweeten soft drinks and many foods (see p. 505). Fructose transport into cells is not insulin dependent (unlike that of glucose into certain tissues; see p. 192), and, in contrast to glucose, fructose does not promote the secretion of insulin. Fructose is seen in large quantities in seminal plasma, where it provides energy for mobility of spermatozoa.\nA. Phosphorylation\nFor fructose to enter the pathways of intermediary metabolism, it must first be phosphorylated (\nFig. 17.2 ). This can be accomplished by either \nhexokinase  or fructokinase .

However, it has a low affinity (that is, a high Michaelis constant [K\nm]; see p. 140) for fructose. Therefore, unless \nthe intracellular concentration of fructose becomes unusually high, the normal presence of saturating concentrations of glucose means that little fructose is phosphorylated by hexokinase . Fructokinase  provides \nthe primary mechanism for fructose phosphorylation (see \nFig. 17.2 ). \nThe enzyme has a low K m for fructose and a high V max ([maximal \nvelocity], see p. 139). It is found in the liver (which processes most of the dietary fructose), kidneys, and the small intestine and converts fruc-tose to fructose 1-phosphate, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: These three tissues also contain aldolase B , discussed in section B.] \nFructokinase phosphorylates at first position, while hexokinase phos-\nphorylates at sixth position.\nB. Fructose 1-phosphate cleavage\nFructose 1-phosphate is not phosphorylated to fructose 1,6- bisphos-phate as is fructose 6-phosphate (see p. 195) but is cleaved by aldolase \nB (also called fructose 1-phosphate aldolase ) to two trioses, dihy-\ndroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. [Note: Humans express three aldolase  isozymes (the products of three different genes): \naldolase A  in most tissues; aldolase B  in the liver, kidneys, and small \nintestine; and aldolase C  in the brain. All cleave fructose 1,6-bisphos-\nphate produced during glycolysis to DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phos-phate (see p. 196), but only aldolase B  cleaves fructose 1-phosphate.] \nDHAP can be used in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, whereas glycer-aldehyde can be metabolized by a number of pathways, as illustrated in \nFigure 17.3 .\nC. Kinetics\nThe rate of fructose metabolism is more rapid than that of glucose because triose production from fructose 1-phosphate bypasses phos-\nphofructokinase-1,  the major rate-limiting step in glycolysis (see p. 195).\nD. Disorders\nA deficiency of one of the key enzymes required for the entry of fruc-\ntose into metabolic pathways can result in either a benign condition as a result of fructokinase  deficiency (essential fructosuria) or a severe \ndisturbance of liver and kidney metabolism as a result of aldolase B  defi-\nciency (hereditary fructose intolerance [HFI]), which occurs in ~1:20,000 live births (see \nFig. 17.3 ). The first symptoms of HFI appear when a \nbaby is weaned from lactose-containing milk and begins ingesting food containing sucrose or fructose. Fructose 1-phosphate accumulates, resulting in a drop in the level of inorganic phosphate (P\ni) and, there-\nfore, of ATP production. Fructose 1-phosphate also inhibits glycogen \nphosphorylase , which causes accumulation of glycogen in liver and \nhypoglycemia . As ATP falls, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) rises. \nThe AMP is degraded, causing hyperuricemia (and lactic acidemia; see p. 582). The decreased availability of hepatic ATP decreases gluco-neogenesis (causing hypoglycemia with vomiting) and protein synthesis (causing a decrease in blood-clotting factors and other essential proteins). Renal reabsorption of P\ni is also decreased.

An alternate \nmechanism for metabolizing a monosaccharide is to convert it to a polyol (sugar alcohol) by the reduction of an aldehyde group, thereby producing an additional hydroxyl group. This pathway is known as sorbitol (or polyol) pathway.\n 1. Sorbitol synthesis:  Aldose reductase  reduces glucose, producing \nsorbitol (or, glucitol; \nFig. 17.4 ), but the K m is high. This enzyme is \nfound in many tissues, including the retina, lens, kidneys, peripheral nerves, ovaries, and seminal vesicles. A second enzyme, sorbitol \ndehydrogenase , can oxidize sorbitol to fructose in cells of the liver, \novaries, and seminal vesicles (see \nFig. 17.4 ). The two-reaction \npathway from glucose to fructose in the seminal vesicles benefits sperm cells, which use fructose as a major carbohydrate energy source. The pathway from sorbitol to fructose in the liver provides a mechanism by which any available sorbitol is converted into a substrate that can enter glycolysis.\n 2. Hyperglycemia and sorbitol metabolism:  Because insulin is \nnot required for the entry of glucose into cells of the retina, lens, kidneys, and peripheral nerves, large amounts of glucose may enter these cells during times of hyperglycemia (for example, in uncon-trolled diabetes). Elevated intracellular glucose concentrations and an adequate supply of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cause aldose reductase  to produce a signif-\nicant increase in the amount of sorbitol, which cannot pass effi-ciently through cell membranes and, therefore, remains trapped inside the cell (see \nFig. 17.4 ). This is exacerbated when sorbitol \ndehydrogenase  is low or absent (for example, in cells of the retina, \nlens, kidneys, and peripheral nerves). As a result, sorbitol accumu-lates in these cells, causing strong osmotic effects and cell swelling due to water influx and retention. Some of the pathologic alterations associated with diabetes can be partly attributed to this osmotic stress, including cataract formation, peripheral neuropathy, and microvascular problems leading to nephropathy and retinopathy (see p. 477). [Note: Use of NADPH in the aldose reductase  reaction \ndecreases the generation of reduced glutathione, an important anti-oxidant (see p. 253), and may be related to diabetic complications.]\nIII. GALACTOSE METABOLISM\nThe major dietary source of galactose is lactose (galactosyl \u03b2-1,4-glucose) \nobtained from milk and milk products. [Note: The digestion of lactose by \u03b2-galactosidase  (lactase ) of the intestinal mucosal cell membrane was \ndiscussed on p. 180.] Some galactose can also be obtained by lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Like fructose (and mannose), the transport of galactose into cells is not insulin dependent.\nA. Phosphorylation\nLike fructose, galactose must be phosphorylated before it can be further metabolized. Most tissues have a specific enzyme for this purpose, galactokinase , which produces galactose 1-phosphate (\nFig. 17.5 ). As \nwith other kinases , ATP is the phosphate donor.SorbitolNADPH + H+\nAldose\nreductase\nNADP+GlucoseGlycolysisSorbitol\nFructoseSorbitol\ndehydrogenaseAldose\nreductaseGlycolysis SEMINAL VESICLES\nH2OGlucose\n(elevated)BLOODGlucose GlucoseBLOOD\nH2O\nH2OCH2OHCHO HCHO HC HO HCH2OH\nCHO HCH2OH\nCH2OHCHO HCHO HC HO HCHO\nCHO H\nCH2OHCHO HCHO HC HO HC  ONADH + H+NAD+NADPH + H+\nNADP+\nLENSES, NERVES,\nAND KIDNEYSA\nB\nFigure 17.4\nSorbitol metabolism.

[Note: If galactose is not provided by the diet (for example, when it cannot be released from lactose owing to a lack of \u03b2-galactosidase  in people who are lactose intolerant), all tissue require-\nments for UDP-galactose can be met by the action of UDP-hexose \n4-epimerase  on UDP-glucose, which is efficiently produced from \nglucose 1-phosphate and uridine triphosphate (see \nFig. 17.5 ).]\nE. Disorders\nGALT  is severely deficient in individuals with classic galactosemia \n(see Fig. 17.5 ). In this disorder, galactose 1-phosphate and, therefore, \ngalactose accumulate. Physiologic consequences are similar to those found in HFI (see p. 241), but a broader spectrum of tissues is affected. The accumulated galactose is shunted into side pathways such as that of galactitol production. This reaction is catalyzed by aldose reductase , \nthe same enzyme that reduces glucose to sorbitol (see p. 242). GALT  \ndeficiency is part of the newborn screening panel. Treatment of galac-tosemia requires removal of galactose and lactose from the diet. [Note: Deficiencies in galactokinase  and the epimerase  result in less severe \ndisorders of galactose metabolism, although cataracts are common (see \nFig. 17.5 ).]\nIV. LACTOSE SYNTHESIS\nLactose is a disaccharide that consists of a molecule of \u03b2-galactose \nattached by a \u03b2(1\u21924) linkage to glucose. Therefore, lactose is galactosyl \n\u03b2(1\u21924)-glucose. Because lactose (milk sugar) is made by lactating (milk-\nproducing) mammary glands, milk and other dairy products are the dietary sources of lactose. Lactose is synthesized in the Golgi by lactose synthase  \n(UDP-galactose:glucose galactosyltransferase ), which transfers galactose \nfrom UDP-galactose to glucose, releasing UDP (\nFig. 17.7 ). This enzyme is \ncomposed of two proteins, A and B. Protein A is a \u03b2-D-galactosyltransferase  \nand is found in a number of body tissues. In tissues other than the lactating mammary gland, this enzyme transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetyl-\nD-glucosamine, forming the same \u03b2(1\u21924) linkage found in lactose, \nand producing N-acetyllactosamine, a component of the structurally impor-tant N-linked glycoproteins (see p. 273). In contrast, protein B is found only in lactating mammary glands. It is \u03b1-lactalbumin, and its synthesis is stimu-\nlated by the peptide hormone prolactin. Protein B forms a complex with the enzyme, protein A, changing the specificity of that transferase  (by decreasing \nthe K\nm for glucose) so that lactose, rather than N-acetyllactosamine, is \nproduced (see Fig. 17.7 ).b-D-Galactosyltransferase\n(protein A)\nUDP-galactose:glucose\ngalactosyltransferase\n(lactose synthase )a-Lactalbumin\n(protein B)\nUDPUDP-galactose \n+ glucose\nOLactose\nCH2OH\nOH\nOHHO\nOOCH2OH\nOH\nOHHOH\nb-Galactose Glucose\nFigure 17.7\nLactose synthesis.

Due to this, fructose was consid-\nered good for patients with diabetes mellitus. But due to rapid entry in cells, it increases fatty acid synthesis, raises serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level. It also increases triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis by increasing availability of glycerol phosphate from glycolysis. Accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate lowers Pi levels in cell, which remove the inhibitory effect on adenosine deaminase. There is increased conversion of adenosine monophos-phate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and subsequent increase in uric acid production. In prolonged hypergly-cemia, large quantities of sorbitol accumulate in cells of retina, lens, kidneys, and peripheral nerves, causing peripheral neuropathy, and microvascular problems leading to nephropathy and retinopathy. \nNeonates with galactosemia present early after birth with vomiting and jaundice. Even with early diagnosis and treatment, \nmanifestations of the condition seem to be present in most individuals with galactosemia, including some mental delays, learning disorders, fine and gross motor skill complications. The treatment involves a galactose-restricted diet and coun-seling. These babies should to be weaned immediately from breast milk or formula containing lactose or galactose and should be put on a soya-metabolism. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a feature of fructose intolerance and galactosemia. It is also seen in glycogen storage disease type 1, medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase  deficiency and long-chain \nfatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase  deficiency.\nVI. Chapter Summary\nThe major source of fructose is the disaccharide sucrose , which, when cleaved, releases equimolar amounts of fruc-\ntose and glucose  (Fig. 17.8 ). Transport of fructose into cells is insulin independent . Fructose is first phosphorylated to \nfructose 1-phosphate  by fructokinase  and then cleaved by aldolase B  to dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and glyc-\neraldehyde . These enzymes are found in the liver, kidneys , and small intestine . A deficiency of fructokinase  causes a \nbenign condition ( essential fructosuria ), whereas a deficiency of aldolase B  causes hereditary fructose intolerance \n(HFI) , in which severe hypoglycemia  and liver failure  lead to death  if fructose (and sucrose) is not removed from the \ndiet. Mannose , an important component of glycoproteins , is phosphorylated by hexokinase  to mannose 6-phosphate , \nwhich is reversibly isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate  by phosphomannose isomerase . Glucose can be reduced to \nsorbitol  (glucitol ) by aldose reductase  in many tissues, including the lens, retina , peripheral nerves , kidneys , ovaries , \nand seminal vesicles . In the liver, ovaries, and seminal vesicles, a second enzyme, sorbitol dehydrogenase , can oxidize \nsorbitol to produce fructose . Hyperglycemia  results in the accumulation of sorbitol in those cells lacking sorbitol dehy-\ndrogenase . The resulting osmotic events  cause cell swelling and may contribute to the cataract formation , peripheral \nneuropathy , nephropathy , and retinopathy  seen in diabetes . The major dietary source of galactose  is lactose . The \ntransport of galactose into cells is insulin independent. Galactose is first phosphorylated by galactokinase  (a deficiency \nresults in cataracts) to galactose 1-phosphate . This compound is converted to uridine diphosphate  (UDP )-galactose  \nby galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase  (GALT ), with the nucleotide supplied by UDP-glucose. A deficiency of \nthis enzyme causes classic galactosemia . Galactose 1-phosphate accumulates, and excess galactose is converted to \ngalactitol  by aldose reductase . This causes liver damage , brain damage , and cataracts . Treatment requires removal \nof galactose (and lactose) from the diet. For UDP-galactose to enter the mainstream of glucose metabolism, it must first be isomerized to UDP-glucose by UDP -hexose 4-epimerase . This enzyme can also be used to produce UDP-galactose \nfrom UDP-glucose when the former is required for glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis. Lactose  is a disaccharide of \ngalactose  and glucose . Milk and other dairy products  are the dietary sources of lactose. Lactose is synthesized by \nlactose synthase  from UDP -galactose  and glucose  in the lactating mammary gland . The enzyme has two subunits, \nprotein A  (which is a galactosyltransferase  found in most cells where it synthesizes N-acetyllactosamine ) and protein \nB (\u03b1-lactalbumin , which is found only in lactating mammary glands, and whose synthesis is stimulated by the peptide \nhormone prolactin ). When both subunits are present, the transferase  produces lactose.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   246 24-10-2020   12:09:01"

Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose \nis converted to UDP-galactose by UDP-hexose 4-epim-erase, thereby providing the appropriate form of galactose for lactose synthesis. Isomerization of fructose to galac-tose does not occur in the human body. Galactose is not converted to galactose 1-phosphate by hexokinase. A galactose-free diet provides no galactose. Galactosemia is the result of an enzyme (galactose 1-phosphate uridyl-yltransferase) deficiency.17.1. A nursing female with classic galactosemia is on a \ngalactose-free diet. She is able to produce lactose in breast milk because:\nA. galactose can be produced from fructose by \nisomerization.\nB. galactose can be produced from a glucose \nmetabolite by epimerization.\nC. hexokinase can efficiently phosphorylate \ngalactose to galactose 1-phosphate.\nD. the enzyme affected in galactosemia is acti-\nvated by a hormone produced in the mammary gland.\nCorrect answer = A.  The symptoms suggest hered-\nitary fructose intolerance, a deficiency in aldolase B. Deficiencies in fructokinase or galactokinase result in rela-tively benign conditions characterized by elevated levels of fructose or galactose in the blood and urine. Deficiency in \u03b2-galactosidase (lactase) results in a decreased ability to \ndegrade lactose (milk sugar). Congenital lactase deficiency is quite rare and would have presented much earlier in this baby (and with different symptoms). Typical lactase defi-ciency (adult hypolactasia) presents at a later age.17.2. A 5-month-old boy is brought to his physician \nbecause of vomiting, night sweats, and tremors.

OVERVIEW\nThe pentose phosphate pathway (or, hexose monophosphate [HMP] shunt \nor, phosphogluconate pathway) occurs in the cytosol. It includes an irre-versible oxidative phase, followed by a series of reversible sugar\u2013phos-phate interconversions (\nFig. 18.1 ). In the oxidative phase, carbon 1 of a \nglucose 6-phosphate molecule is released as carbon dioxide (CO 2), and \none pentose sugar-phosphate plus two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH) are produced. The rate and direction of the reversible reactions are determined by the supply of and demand for intermediates of the pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway provides a major portion of the body\u2019s NADPH, which functions as a biochemical reductant. It also produces ribose 5-phosphate, required for nucleotide biosynthesis (see p. 575), and provides a mechanism for the conversion of pentose sugars to triose and hexose intermediates of glycolysis. No ATP is directly consumed or produced in the pathway.\nII.

Ribulose 5-phosphate formation\n6-Phosphogluconolactone is hydrolyzed by 6-phosphogluconolac-\ntone hydrolase  in the second step. The oxidative decarboxylation of \nthe product, 6-phosphogluconate, is catalyzed by 6-phosphogluconate \ndehydrogenase.  This third irreversible step produces ribulose 5-phos-\nphate (a pentose sugar\u2013phosphate), CO 2 (from carbon 1 of glucose), \nand a second molecule of NADPH (see Fig. 18.2 ).\nIII. REVERSIBLE NONOXIDATIVE REACTIONS\nThe nonoxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway occur in all cell types synthesizing nucleotides and nucleic acids. These reactions catalyze the interconversion of sugars containing three to seven carbons (see \nFig. 18.2 ). These reversible reactions permit ribulose 5-phosphate \n(produced by the oxidative portion of the pathway) to be converted either to ribose 5-phosphate (needed for nucleotide synthesis; see p. 575) or to inter-mediates of glycolysis (that is, fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). For example, many cells that carry out reductive biosynthetic reactions have a greater need for NADPH than for ribose 5-phosphate. In this case, transketolase  (which transfers two-carbon units in a thiamine \npyrophosphate [TPP]-requiring reaction) and transaldolase  (which transfers \nthree-carbon units) convert the ribulose 5-phosphate produced as an end product of the oxidative phase to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fruc-tose 6-phosphate, which are glycolytic intermediates. In contrast, when the demand for ribose for nucleotides and nucleic acids is greater than the need for NADPH, the nonoxidative reactions can provide the ribose 5-phosphate from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate in the absence of the oxidative steps (\nFig. 18.3 ).\nIn addition to transketolase , TPP is required by the multi-\nenzyme complexes pyruvate dehydrogenase  (see p. 207), \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase  of the tricarboxylic acid cycle \n(see p. 209), and branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase  \nof branched-chain amino acid catabolism (see p. 401).\nA.

            "Text": "IV. NADPH Uses 253\ncell. For example, in the cytosol of hepatocytes, the steady-state NADP+/ \nNADPH ratio is ~0.1, which favors the use of NADPH in reductive biosyn-thetic reactions. This contrasts with the high NAD\n+/NADH ratio (~1,000), \nwhich favors an oxidative role for NAD+. This section summarizes some \nimportant NADPH-specific functions in reductive biosynthesis and detoxi-fication reactions.\nA. Reductive biosynthesis\nLike NADH, NADPH can be thought of as a high-energy molecule. However, the electrons of NADPH are used for reductive biosynthesis, rather than for transfer to the electron transport chain as is seen with NADH (see p. 163). Thus, in the metabolic transformations of the pentose phosphate pathway, part of the energy of glucose 6-phosphate is conserved in NADPH, a molecule with a negative reduction potential (see p. 167), that, therefore, can be used in reactions requiring an elec-tron donor, such as fatty acid (see p. 303), cholesterol (see p. 344), and steroid hormone (see p. 360) synthesis.\nB. Hydrogen peroxide reduction\nHydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is one of a family of reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) that are formed from the partial reduction of molecular oxygen ([O\n2], Fig. 18.5A ). These compounds are formed continuously as \nbyproducts of aerobic metabolism, through reactions with drugs and environmental toxins, or when the level of antioxidants is diminished, all creating the condition of oxidative stress. These highly reactive oxygen intermediates can cause serious chemical damage to DNA, proteins, and unsaturated lipids and can lead to cell death. ROS have been impli-cated in a number of pathologic processes, including reperfusion injury, cancer, inflammatory disease, and aging. The cell has several protec-tive mechanisms that minimize the toxic potential of these compounds. [Note: ROS can also be generated in the killing of microbes by white blood cells (WBC; see D. below).]\n 1. Enzymes that catalyze antioxidant reactions:  Reduced gluta-\nthione (G-SH), a tripeptide-thiol ( \u03b3-glutamylcysteinylglycine) present \nin most cells, can chemically detoxify H\n2O2 (Fig. 18.5B ). This reac-\ntion, catalyzed by the selenoprotein (see p. 561) glutathione perox-\nidase , forms oxidized glutathione (G-S-S-G), which no longer has \nprotective properties.

Thus, NADPH indirectly provides electrons for the reduction of H\n2O2 (Fig. 18.6 ). Additional enzymes, such as super-\noxide dismutase  and catalase , catalyze the conversion of other ROS \nto harmless products (see Fig. 18.5B ). As a group, these enzymes \nserve as a defense system to guard against the toxic effects of ROS.\nFree radicals are molecules which contain one or more \nunpaired electrons in their outer orbit. Free radicals include reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxide radical, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite. Free radicals are highly reactive, and they react with normal compounds to generate other free radicals, causing a chain reaction. Oxidation of enzymes causes loss of function, DNA damage causes strand breaks, polysaccharides undergo degradation and peroxidation of membrane lipids damages cell membranes (see Chapter 52).\n 2. Antioxidant chemicals:  A number of intracellular reducing agents, \nsuch as ascorbate (see p. 527), vitamin E (see p. 544), and \u03b2-carotene (see p. 534), are able to reduce and, thereby, detoxify \nROS in the laboratory. Consumption of foods rich in these antioxi-dant compounds has been correlated with a reduced risk for certain types of cancers as well as decreased frequency of certain other chronic health problems. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the effects of these compounds are, in part, an expression of their ability to quench the toxic effect of ROS. However, clinical trials with antioxidants as dietary supplements have failed to show clear bene-ficial effects. In the case of dietary supplementation with \u03b2-carotene, \nthe rate of lung cancer in smokers increased rather than decreased. Thus, the health-promoting effects of dietary fruits and vegetables likely reflect a complex interaction among many naturally occur-ring compounds, which has not been duplicated by consumption of isolated antioxidant compounds.\nC. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system\nMonooxygenases  (mixed-function oxidases ) incorporate one atom from \nO2 into a substrate (creating a hydroxyl group), with the other atom \nbeing reduced to water (H 2O). In the cytochrome P450  (CYP) monooxy-\ngenase  system, NADPH provides the reducing equivalents required by \nthis series of reactions ( Fig. 18.7 ). This system performs different func-\ntions in two separate locations in cells. The overall reaction catalyzed by a CYP enzyme is\nR\u2013H + O\n2 + NADPH + H+ \u2192 R\u2013OH + H 2O + NADP+\nwhere R may be a steroid, drug, or other chemical.

The P450 in the name reflects the absorbance at 450 nm by the protein.]\n 1. Mitochondrial system:  An important function of the CYP mono-\noxygenase  system found associated with the inner mitochondrial \nmembrane is the biosynthesis of steroid hormones.

The liver uses this \nsame system in bile acid synthesis (see p. 347) and the hydrox-ylation of cholecalciferol to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ([vitamin D\n3], \nsee p. 539), and the kidney uses it to hydroxylate vitamin D 3 to its \nbiologically active 1,25-dihydroxylated form.\n 2. Microsomal system:  The microsomal CYP monooxygenase  system \nfound associated with the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (particularly in the liver) functions primarily in the detoxifi-cation of foreign compounds (xenobiotics). These include numerous drugs and such varied pollutants as petroleum products and pesti-cides. CYP enzymes of the microsomal system (for example, \nCYP3A4 ) can be used to hydroxylate these toxins (phase I). The \npurpose of these modifications is two-fold. First, it may itself acti-vate or inactivate a drug and second, make a toxic compound more soluble, thereby facilitating its excretion in the urine or feces. Frequently, however, the new hydroxyl group will serve as a site for conjugation with a polar molecule, such as glucuronic acid (see p. 268), which will significantly increase the compound\u2019s solubility (phase II). [Note: Polymorphisms (see p. 682) in the genes for CYP \nenzymes can lead to differences in drug metabolism.]\nD. White blood cell phagocytosis and microbe killing\nPhagocytosis is the ingestion by receptor-mediated endocytosis of microorganisms, foreign particles, and cellular debris by WBC (leuko-cytes) such as neutrophils and macrophages (monocytes). It is an impor-tant defense mechanism, particularly in bacterial infections. Neutrophils and monocytes are armed with both oxygen-independent and oxygen-dependent mechanisms for killing bacteria.\n 1. Oxygen-independent:  Oxygen-independent mechanisms use pH \nchanges in phagolysosomes and lysosomal enzymes to destroy pathogens.\n 2. Oxygen-dependent:  Oxygen-dependent mechanisms include the \nenzymes NADPH oxidase  and myeloperoxidase  (MPO ) that work \ntogether in killing bacteria (\nFig. 18.8 ). Overall, the MPO  system is the \nmost potent of the bactericidal mechanisms. An invading bacterium is recognized by the immune system and attacked by antibodies that bind it to a receptor on a phagocytic cell. After internaliza-tion of the microorganism has occurred, NADPH oxidase , located \nin the leukocyte cell membrane, is activated and reduces O\n2 from \nthe surrounding tissue to superoxide (O 2\u2022), a free radical ROS, as \nNADPH is oxidized. The rapid consumption of O 2 that accompanies \nformation of O 2\u2022 is referred to as the respiratory burst. [Note: Active \nNADPH oxidase  is a membrane-associated complex containing \na flavocytochrome plus additional peptides that translocate from the cytoplasm upon activation of the leukocyte. Electrons move from NADPH to O\n2 via flavin adenine nucleotide (FAD) and heme, \ngenerating O 2\u2022. Rare genetic deficiencies in NADPH oxidase  cause \nchronic granulomatous disease (CGD) characterized by severe, persistent infections and the formation of granulomas (nodular areas of inflammation) that sequester the bacteria that were not destroyed.] Next, O\n2\u2022  is converted to H 2O2 (also a ROS), either \nspontaneously or catalyzed by superoxide dismutase .

[Note: Deficiencies \nin MPO  do not confer increased susceptibility to infection because \nperoxide from NADPH oxidase  is bactericidal.]\nE. Nitric oxide synthesis\nNitric oxide (NO) is recognized as a mediator in a broad array of \nbiologic systems. NO is the endothelium-derived relaxing factor that causes vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle. It also acts as a neurotransmitter, prevents platelet aggregation, and plays an essen-tial role in macrophage function. It has a very short half-life in tissues (3\u201310 seconds) because it reacts with O\n2 and O 2\u2022 and is converted \ninto nitrates and nitrites including peroxynitrite (O=NOO\u2212), a reactive \nnitrogen species (RNS). [Note: NO is a free radical gas that is often confused with nitrous oxide (N\n2O), the \u201claughing gas\u201d that is used as \nan anesthetic and is chemically stable.]\n 1. Nitric oxide synthase:  Arginine, O 2, and NADPH are substrates \nfor cytosolic NO synthase  ([NOS ], Fig. 18.9 ). Flavin mononucleotide \n(FMN), FAD, heme, and tetrahydrobiopterin (see p. 403) are coen-zymes, and NO and citrulline are products of the reaction. Three NOS  isozymes, each the product of a different gene, have been \nidentified. Two are constitutive (synthesized at a constant rate), calcium (Ca\n2+)\u2013calmodulin (CaM)-dependent enzymes (see p. 234). \nThey are found primarily in endothelium ( eNOS ) and neural tissue \n(nNOS ) and constantly produce very low levels of NO for vasodila-\ntion and neurotransmission. An inducible, Ca2+-independent enzyme \n(iNOS ) can be expressed in many cells, including macrophages and \nneutrophils, as an early defense against pathogens. The specific inducers for iNOS  vary with cell type and include proinflammatory \ncytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) and interferon- \u03b3 \n(IFN- \u03b3), and bacterial endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). \nThese compounds promote synthesis of iNOS , which can result in \nlarge amounts of NO being produced over hours or even days.\n 2. Nitric oxide and vascular endothelium:  NO is an important medi-\nator in the control of vascular smooth muscle tone. NO is synthe-sized by eNOS  in endothelial cells and diffuses to vascular smooth \nmuscle, where it activates the cytosolic form of guanylyl cyclase  \n(or, guanylate cyclase ) to form cyclic guanosine monophosphate \n(cGMP). [Note: This reaction is analogous to the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase  (see p. 190).] \nThe resultant rise in cGMP causes activation of protein kinase G , \nwhich phosphorylates Ca\n2+ channels, causing decreased entry of \nCa2+ into smooth muscle cells. This decreases the Ca2+\u2013CaM acti-\nvation of myosin light-chain kinase , thereby decreasing smooth \nmuscle contraction and favoring relaxation. Vasodilator nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, are metabolized to NO, which causes relax-ation of vascular smooth muscle and, therefore, lowers blood pres-sure. Thus, NO can be envisioned as an endogenous nitrovasodilator. [Note: Under hypoxic conditions, nitrite (NO\n2\u2212) can be reduced to \nNO, which binds to deoxyhemoglobin.

Nitric oxide and macrophage bactericidal activity:  In macro-\nphages, iNOS  activity is normally low, but synthesis of the enzyme is \nsignificantly stimulated by bacterial LPS and by release of IFN- \u03b3 and \nTNF- \u03b1 in response to infection. Activated macrophages form O 2\u2022 \nradicals that combine with NO to form intermediates that decom-pose, producing the highly bactericidal OH \u2022 radical.\n 4. Additional functions:  NO is a potent inhibitor of platelet adhesion \nand aggregation (by activating the cGMP pathway). It is also char-acterized as a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems.\nV. G6PD DEFICIENCY\nG6PD  deficiency is a hereditary condition characterized by hemolytic \nanemia caused by the inability to detoxify oxidizing agents. G6PD  defi-\nciency is the most common disease-producing enzyme abnormality in humans, affecting >400 million individuals worldwide. This deficiency has the highest prevalence in the Middle East, tropical Africa and Asia, and parts of the Mediterranean. G6PD  deficiency is X linked and is, in fact, a \nfamily of deficiencies caused by a number of different mutations in the gene encoding G6PD . Only some of the resulting protein variants cause clinical \nsymptoms. [Note: In addition to hemolytic anemia, a clinical manifestation of G6PD  deficiency is neonatal jaundice appearing 1\u20134 days after birth. The \njaundice, which may be severe, typically results from increased production of unconjugated bilirubin (see p. 422).] The life span of individuals with a severe form of G6PD  deficiency may be somewhat shortened as a result of \ncomplications arising from chronic hemolysis. This negative effect of G6PD  \ndeficiency has been balanced in evolution by an advantage in survival, an increased resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. [Note: Sickle cell trait and the thalassemias also confer resistance to malaria.]\nA. G6PD role in RBCs\nDiminished G6PD  activity impairs the ability of the cell to form the NADPH \nthat is essential for the maintenance of the G-SH pool. This results in a decrease in the detoxification of free radicals and peroxides formed within the cell (\nFig. 18.10 ). G-SH also helps maintain the reduced states \nof sulfhydryl groups in proteins, including hemoglobin. Oxidation of those sulfhydryl groups leads to the formation of denatured proteins that form insoluble masses (called Heinz bodies) that attach to RBC membranes (\nFig. 18.11 ). Additional oxidation of membrane proteins causes RBC to \nbe rigid (less deformable), and they are removed from the circulation by macrophages in the spleen and liver. Although G6PD  deficiency occurs \nin all cells of the affected individual, it is most severe in RBC, where the pentose phosphate pathway provides the only means of generating NADPH. Additionally, the RBC has no nucleus or ribosomes and cannot renew its supply of the enzyme. Thus, RBC are particularly vulnerable to enzyme variants with diminished stability. [Note: Other tissues have an alternative source of NADPH ( NADP\n+-dependent malate dehydrogenase  \n[malic enzyme ]; see p. 303) that can keep G-SH reduced.]\nB.

Pentose Phosphate Pathway and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate\nsome patients with G6PD  deficiency develop hemolytic anemia if they \nare treated with an oxidant drug, ingest fava beans, or contract a severe infection.\n 1. Oxidant drugs:  Commonly used drugs that produce hemolytic \nanemia in patients with G6PD  deficiency are best remembered from \nthe mnemonic AAA: antibiotics (for example, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol), antimalarials (for example, primaquine but not chloroquine or quinine), and antipyretics (for example, acetanilide but not acetaminophen).\n 2. Favism:  Some forms of G6PD  deficiency, for example, the \nMediterranean variant, are particularly susceptible to the hemolytic effect of the fava (broad) bean, a dietary staple in the Mediterranean region. Favism, the hemolytic effect of ingesting fava beans, is not observed in all individuals with G6PD  deficiency, but all patients \nwith favism have G6PD  deficiency.\n 3. Infection:  Infection is the most common precipitating factor of \nhemolysis in G6PD  deficiency. The inflammatory response to infec-\ntion results in the generation of free radicals in macrophages. The radicals can diffuse into the RBC and cause oxidative damage.\nC. Variant G6PD properties\nAlmost all G6PD  variants are caused by point mutations (see p. 635) \nin the gene for G6PD . Some mutations do not affect enzymic activity. \nHowever, other mutations result in decreased catalytic activity, decreased stability, or an alteration of binding affinity for NADP\n+ or glucose 6-phos-\nphate. [Note: Active G6PD  exists as a homodimer or tetramer. Mutations \nat the interface between subunits can affect stability.] The severity of the disease usually correlates with the amount of residual enzyme activity in the patient\u2019s RBC. For example, variants can be classified as shown in \nFigure 18.12 . G6PD A\u2013 is the prototype of the moderate \n(class III) form of the disease. The RBC contain an unstable but kinet-ically normal G6PD , with most of the enzyme activity present in the \nreticulocytes and younger RBC (\nFig. 18.13 ).

G6PD Mediterranean  is the proto-\ntype of a more severe (class II) deficiency. Class I mutations (rare) are the most severe and are associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemo-lytic anemia, which occurs even in the absence of oxidative stress.\nD. G6PD molecular biology\nThe cloning of the gene for G6PD  and the sequencing of its DNA \n(see Chapter 44) have permitted the identification of mutations that cause G6PD  deficiency. More than 400 G6PD  variants have been iden-\ntified, a finding that explains the numerous biochemical and clinical phenotypes that have been described. Most mutations that result in enzymic deficiency are missense mutations (see p. 635) in the coding region. Both G6PD A\n\u2212 and G6PD Mediterranean  represent mutant \nenzymes that differ from the respective normal variants by a single amino acid. Large deletions or frameshift mutations have not been iden-tified, suggesting that complete absence of G6PD  activity is likely lethal.\nVI. Medical Perspectives\nDefects in the HMP shunt have major health consequences. The conse-\nquences of G6PD deficiency are mostly seen in RBCs, which can no longer defend against oxidative stress. The deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia, with aggregates of globin chains forming the characteristic Heinz bodies. G6PD deficiency confers a degree of resistance to malaria.\nPersons with G6PD deficiency also show increased methemoglobin in \ncirculation.\nHMP shunt is used for diagnosing thiamine (vitamin B\n1) deficiency. Thiamine \nis administered to suspected patient and the activity of the transketolase \nenzyme of HMP shunt within RBCs is measured. If transketolase activity \nincreases, it confirms the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency.\nRare genetic defects in NADPH oxidase  cause chronic granulomatous \ndisease , an immunodeficient state characterized by recurrent bacterial \nand fungal infections.\nG6PD\nMediterranean\nG6PD B\n(normal enzyme)\n50100\nG6PD A\u2013G6PD activity in erythrocytes\nFigure 18.13\nDecline of erythrocyte glucose \n6-phosphate dehydrogenase  (G6PD ) \nactivity with cell age for the three most commonly encountered forms of the enzyme.\nVII. Chapter Summary\nThe pentose phosphate pathway  includes an irreversible oxidative phase followed by a series of reversible sugar\u2013\nphosphate interconversions ( Fig. 18.14 ). No ATP is directly consumed or produced in the pathway. The reduced nicotin-\namide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-producing oxidative portion  of the pathway is important in providing \nreducing equivalents for reductive biosynthesis and detoxification reactions. In this part of the pathway, glucose 6-phos-\nphate  is irreversibly converted to ribulose 5-phosphate , and two NADPH  are produced. The regulated step is cata-\nlyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase  (G6PD ), which is strongly inhibited by a rise in the NADPH/NADP+ \nratio . Reversible nonoxidative reactions  interconvert sugars. This part of the pathway converts ribulose 5-phosphate \nto ribose 5-phosphate , required for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis, or to fructose 6-phosphate  and glyceral-\ndehyde 3-phosphate  (glycolytic intermediates). NADPH is a source of reducing equivalents  in reductive biosynthesis , \nsuch as the production of fatty acids in liver, adipose tissue, and the mammary gland; cholesterol in the liver; and steroid hormones in the placenta, ovaries, testes, and adrenal cortex. It is also required by red blood cells  (RBC ) for hydrogen \nperoxide reduction . Reduced glutathione  (G-SH ) is used by glutathione peroxidase  to reduce the peroxide to water. \nThe oxidized glutathione  (G-S-S-G ) produced is reduced by glutathione reductase , using NADPH as the source of \nelectrons. NADPH provides reducing equivalents for the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase  system , \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   259 24-10-2020   12:09:07"

The microsomal system  uses NADPH to detoxify  foreign compounds (xenobiotics), such \nas drugs and a variety of pollutants. NADPH provides the reducing equivalents for phagocytes in the process of elim-inating invading microorganisms. NADPH oxidase  uses molecular oxygen (O\n2) and electrons from NADPH to produce \nsuperoxide radicals , which, in turn, can be converted to peroxide by superoxide dismutase . Myeloperoxidase  cata-\nlyzes the formation of bactericidal hypochlorous acid from peroxide and chloride ions. Rare genetic defects in NADPH \noxidase  cause chronic granulomatous disease  characterized by severe, persistent, infections and granuloma forma-\ntion. NADPH is required for the synthesis of nitric oxide  (NO), an important free radical gas that causes vasodilation  by \nrelaxing vascular smooth muscle, acts as a neurotransmitter , prevents platelet aggregation , and helps mediate macro-\nphage bactericidal activity . NO is made from arginine and O 2 by three different NADPH-dependent NO synthases  \n(NOS ). The endothelial  (eNOS ) and neuronal  (nNOS ) isozymes  constantly produce very low levels of NO for vasodilation \nand neurotransmission, respectively. The inducible isozyme  (iNOS ) produces large amounts of NO for defense against \npathogens. G6PD  deficiency  impairs the ability of the cell to form the NADPH that is essential for the maintenance of \nthe G-SH pool. The cells most affected are RBC  because they do not have additional sources of NADPH.

Glutathione (G-SH) is essential for \nred cell integrity and is maintained in this reduced (func-tional) form by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos-phate (NADPH)-dependent glutathione reductase. The NADPH is from the oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway. Individuals with a deficiency of the regulated enzyme of this pathway, glucose 6-phos-phate dehydrogenase  (G6PD), have a decreased ability \nto generate NADPH and, therefore, a decreased ability to keep G-SH reduced. When treated with an oxidant drug such as primaquine, some patients with G6PD deficiency develop a hemolytic anemia. Primaquine does not affect glucose 6-phosphate levels. Nicotinamide adenine dinu-cleotide (NAD[H]) is neither produced by the pathway nor used as a coenzyme by G-SH reductase. A decrease in ribose 5-phosphate does not cause hemolysis.18.1.

GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN OVERVIEW\nGlycosaminoglycans (GAG) are large complexes of negatively charged \nheteropolysaccharide chains. They are generally associated with a small amount of protein (core protein), forming proteoglycans, which typically consist of up to 95% carbohydrate. GAG have the special ability to bind large amounts of water, thereby producing the gel-like matrix that forms the basis of the body\u2019s ground substance, which, along with fibrous structural proteins such as collagen, elastin, and fibrillin-1, and adhesive proteins such as fibronectin, makes up the extracellular matrix (ECM). The hydrated GAG serve as a flexible support for the ECM, interacting with the structural and adhesive proteins, and as a molecular sieve, influencing movement of materials through the ECM. The viscous, lubricating properties of mucous secretions also result from the presence of GAG, which led to the original naming of these compounds as mucopolysaccharides.\nII. STRUCTURE\nGAG are long, unbranched, heteropolysaccharide chains composed of a repeating disaccharide unit [acidic sugar\u2013amino sugar]\nn (Fig. 19.1 ). [Note: A \nsingle exception is keratan sulfate, which contains galactose rather than an acidic sugar.] The amino sugar is either \nD-glucosamine or D-galactosamine, \nin which the amino group is usually acetylated, thus eliminating its posi-tive charge. The amino sugar may also be sulfated on carbon 4 or 6 or on a nonacetylated nitrogen. The acidic sugar is either \nD-glucuronic acid or its \nC-5 epimer L-iduronic acid ( Fig. 19.2 ). These uronic sugars contain carboxyl \ngroups that are negatively charged at physiologic pH and, together with the sulfate groups (\u2212SO\n42\u2212), give GAG their strongly negative nature.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the structure and classification of glycosaminoglycans\n\u2022 Explain the synthesis and degradation of glycosaminoglycans\u2022 Discuss the diseases associated with glycosaminoglycan metabolism\u2022 Describe the structure and synthesis of glycoproteins\nCH2OH\nOCOOH\nOH\nOHO\nHOOO\nNH\nCH3COAcidic sugarN-Acetylated\namino sugar\nAcetyl\ngroup\nn\nFigure 19.1\nRepeating disaccharide unit of \nglycosaminoglycans.\nL-Iduronic acidO\nCOOH\nOH\nOHHO OHD-Glucuronic acidOCOOH\nOH\nOHHO OHO\nOHHO OH\nNH2CH2OH\nGlucosamine\nFigure 19.2 \nSome monosaccharide units found in glycosaminoglycans.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   264 24-10-2020   12:09:09"

            "Text": "III. Synthesis 265\nA. Structure\u2013function relationship\nBecause of the high concentration of negative charges, these hetero-\npolysaccharide chains tend to be extended in solution. They repel each other and are surrounded by a shell of water molecules. When brought together, they slide past each other, much as two magnets with the same polarity seem to slide past each other. This produces the slippery consistency of mucous secretions and synovial fluid. When a solution of GAG is compressed, the water is squeezed out, and the GAG are forced to occupy a smaller volume. When the compression is released, the GAG spring back to their original, hydrated volume because of the repulsion of their negative charges. This property contributes to the resilience of synovial fluid and the vitreous humor of the eye (\nFig. 19.3 ).\nB. Classification\nThe six major types of GAG are divided according to monomeric composition, type of glycosidic linkages, and degree and location of sulfate units. The structure of the GAG and their distribution in the body is illustrated in \nFigure 19.4 . All GAG, except for hyaluronic acid (HA), are \nsulfated and are found covalently attached to protein, forming proteo-glycan monomers.\nC. Proteoglycans\nProteoglycans are found in the ECM and on the outer surface of cells.\n 1. Monomer structure:  A proteoglycan monomer found in cartilage \nconsists of a core protein to which up to 100 linear chains of GAG are covalently attached. These chains, which may each be composed of up to 200 disaccharide units, extend out from the core protein and remain separated from each other because of charge repul-sion. The resulting structure resembles a bottle brush (\nFig. 19.5 ). In \ncartilage proteoglycans, the species of GAG include chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. [Note: Proteoglycans are grouped into gene fami-lies that encode core proteins with common structural features. The aggrecan family (aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican), abun-dant in cartilage, is an example.]\n 2. GAG\u2013protein linkage:  This covalent linkage is most commonly \nthrough a trihexoside (galactose-galactose-xylose) and a serine residue in the protein. An O-glycosidic bond (see p. 178) is formed between the xylose and the hydroxyl group of the serine (\nFig. 19.6 ).\n 3. Aggregate formation:  Many proteoglycan monomers can asso-\nciate with one molecule of HA to form proteoglycan aggregates. The association is not covalent and occurs primarily through ionic inter-actions between the core protein and the HA. The association is stabilized by additional small proteins called link proteins (\nFig. 19.7 ).\nIII. SYNTHESIS\nThe heteropolysaccharide chains are elongated by the sequential addition of alternating acidic and amino sugars donated primarily by their uridine diphosphate (UDP) derivatives. The reactions are catalyzed by a family of specific glycosyltransferases . Because GAG are produced for export from \nthe cell, their synthesis occurs primarily in the Golgi and not in the cytosol.Figure 19.3 \nResilience of glycosaminoglycans.H2OCompressed\nH2OH2OH\n2OH2O\nH2OH\n2O\nRelaxedH2O\nH2OH2OH\n2OH2O\nH2OH2OH\n2O H2OH2O\nH2O\nH2OH\n2OH2OH2O\nH\n2O H2O\nH2O\nH2O\nH2O\nH2OH\n2OH2OH2O\nH\n2O H2O\nH2O\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   265 24-10-2020   12:09:09"

The synthetic pathway of amino sugars (hexosamines) is very active in connective tissues, where as much as 20% of glucose flows through this pathway.\n 1. N-Acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine:  The mono-\nsaccharide fructose 6-phosphate is the precursor of N-acetylgluco-samine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). A hydroxyl group on the fructose is replaced by the amide nitrogen of a gluta-mine, and the glucosamine 6-phosphate product gets acety-lated, isomerized, and activated, producing the nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc (\nFig. 19.8 ). UDP-GalNAc is generated by the epimer-\nization of UDP-GlcNAc. It is these nucleotide sugar forms of the amino sugars that are used to elongate the carbohydrate chains.\n 2. N-Acetylneuraminic acid:  NANA, a nine-carbon, acidic monosac-\ncharide (see Fig. 22.15, p. 329), is a member of the family of sialic acids, each of which is acylated at a different site. These compounds are usually found as terminal carbohydrate residues of oligosaccha-ride side chains of glycoproteins, of glycolipids, or, less frequently, of GAG. N-Acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (derived from fruc-tose 6-phosphate) and phosphoenolpyruvate (an intermediate in glycolysis; see p. 198) are the immediate sources of the carbons and nitrogens for NANA synthesis (see \nFig. 19.8 ). Before NANA \ncan be added to a growing oligosaccharide, it must be activated to cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-NANA by reacting with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). CMP-NANA synthetase  catalyzes the reaction. \n[Note: CMP-NANA is the only nucleotide sugar in human metabo-lism in which the carrier nucleotide is a monophosphate rather than a diphosphate.]\nB.

In plants and mammals (other than guinea pigs and primates, including humans), glucuronic acid is a precursor of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as shown in \nFigure 19.9 . This uronic acid \npathway also provides a mechanism by which dietary D-xylulose can \nenter the central metabolic pathways.\n 1. Glucuronic acid:  Glucuronic acid can be obtained in small \namounts from the diet and from the lysosomal degradation of GAG. It also can be synthesized by the uronic acid pathway, in which glucose 1-phosphate reacts with uridine triphosphate (UTP) and is converted to UDP-glucose. Oxidation of UDP-glucose produces UDP-glucuronic acid, the form that supplies glucuronic acid for GAG synthesis and glucuronidation (\nFig. 19.10 ). The end product of \nglucuronic acid metabolism in humans is D-xylulose 5-phosphate, \nwhich can enter the pentose phosphate pathway and produce the Figure 19.8\nSynthesis of the amino sugars.

Uronosyl 5-epimerase  causes epimerization of the \nD- to the L-sugar.\nC. Core protein synthesis\nThe core protein is made by ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic \nreticulum (RER), enters the RER lumen, and then moves to the Golgi, where it is glycosylated by membrane-bound glycosyltransferases .\nD. Carbohydrate chain synthesis\nCarbohydrate chain formation is initiated by synthesis of a short linker \non the core protein on which carbohydrate chain synthesis will occur. The most common linker is a trihexoside formed by the transfer of a xylose from UDP-xylose to the hydroxyl group of a serine (or threo-nine) catalyzed by xylosyltransferase . Two galactose molecules are then \nadded, completing the trihexoside. This is followed by sequential addi-tion of alternating acidic and amino sugars (\nFig. 19.11 ) and epimeriza-\ntion of some D-glucuronyl to L-iduronyl residues.\nE. Sulfate group addition\nSulfation of a GAG occurs after the monosaccharide to be sulfated has been incorporated into the growing carbohydrate chain. The source of the sulfate is 3 c-phosphoadenosyl-5 c-phosphosulfate ([PAPS] a mole-\ncule of adenosine monophosphate with a sulfate group attached to the 5c-phosphate; see Fig. 22.16, p. 330). The sulfation reaction is catalyzed \nby sulfotransferases . Synthesis of the sulfated GAG chondroitin sulfate is \nshown in \nFigure 19.11 . [Note: PAPS is also the sulfur donor in glycosphin-\ngolipid synthesis (see p. 330).]\nA defect in the sulfation of the growing GAG chains results in \none of several autosomal-recessive disorders, the chondro-dystrophies, which affect the proper development and main-tenance of the skeletal system.\nIV. DEGRADATION\nGAG are degraded in lysosomes, which contain hydrolytic enzymes that \nare most active at a pH of ~5. Therefore, as a group, these enzymes are called acid hydrolases . [Note: The low pH optimum is a protective mech-\nanism that prevents the enzymes from destroying the cell should leakage occur into the cytosol where the pH is neutral.] The half-lives of GAG vary from minutes to months and are influenced by the type of GAG and its location in the body.\nA. GAG phagocytosis\nBecause GAG are extracellular or cell-surface compounds, they must first be engulfed by invagination of the cell membrane (phagocytosis), forming a vesicle inside of which are the GAG to be degraded.

Lysosomal degradation\nThe lysosomal degradation of GAG requires a large number of acid \nhydrolases  for complete digestion. First, the polysaccharide chains \nare cleaved by endoglycosidases , producing oligosaccharides. Further \ndegradation of the oligosaccharides occurs sequentially from the nonre-ducing end (see p. 228) of each chain, the last group (sulfate or sugar) added during synthesis being the first group removed (by sulfatases  or \nexoglycosidases ). Examples of some of these enzymes and the bonds \nthey hydrolyze are shown in \nFigure 19.12 . [Note: Endo-  and exoglyco-\nsidases  are also involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins \n(see p. 275) and glycolipids (see p. 328). Deficiencies in these enzymes result in the accumulation of partially degraded carbohydrates, causing tissue damage.]\nMultiple sulfatase  deficiency (Austin disease) is a rare lyso-\nsomal storage disease in which all sulfatases  are nonfunc-\ntional because of a defect in the formation of formylglycine, an amino acid derivative required at the active site for enzymic activity to occur.\nV. MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSES\nThe mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are hereditary diseases (approxi-\nmately 1:25,000 live births) caused by a deficiency of any one of the lyso-somal hydrolases  normally involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate \n(HS) and/or dermatan sulfate (see \nFig. 19.12 ). They are progressive disor-\nders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GAG in various tissues, causing a range of symptoms, such as skeletal and ECM deformities, and intellectual disability. All are autosomal-recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome, which is X linked. Children who are homozygous for any one of these diseases are apparently normal at birth and then gradually deterio-rate. In severe deficiencies, death occurs in childhood. There currently is no cure. Incomplete lysosomal degradation of GAG results in the presence of oligosaccharides in the urine. These fragments can be used to diagnose the specific mucopolysaccharidosis by identifying the structure present on the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, because that residue would have been the substrate for the missing enzyme. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the patient\u2019s cellular level of the lysosomal hydrolases . Bone \nmarrow and cord blood transplants, in which transplanted macrophages produce the enzymes that degrade GAG, have been used to treat Hurler and Hunter syndromes, with limited success. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for both syndromes but does not prevent neurologic damage.\nVI. GLYCOPROTEIN OVERVIEW\nGlycoproteins are proteins to which oligosaccharides (glycans) are cova-lently attached.

Glycoproteins contain highly variable amounts of carbo-\nhydrate but typically less than that of proteoglycans. For example, the glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG) contains <4% of its mass as carbo-hydrate, whereas the proteoglycan aggrecan contains >80%. In glycopro-teins, the glycan is relatively short (usually two to ten sugar residues in length, although it can be longer); does not contain repeating disaccharide units and, consequently, is structurally diverse; is often branched instead of linear; and may or may not be negatively charged. Membrane-bound glyco-proteins participate in a broad range of cellular phenomena, including cell-surface recognition (by other cells, hormones, and viruses), cell-surface antigenicity (such as the blood group antigens), and as components of the ECM and of the mucins of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, where they act as protective biologic lubricants. In addition, almost all of the glob-ular proteins present in human plasma are glycoproteins, although albumin is an exception. \nFigure 19.13 summarizes some glycoprotein functions.\nVII. OLIGOSACCHARIDE STRUCTURE\nThe oligosaccharide (glycan) components of glycoproteins are gener-ally branched heteropolymers composed primarily of \nD-hexoses, with the \naddition in some cases of neuraminic acid (a nonose) and of L-fucose, a \n6-deoxyhexose.\nA. Carbohydrate\u2013protein linkage\nThe glycan may be attached to the protein through an N- or an O-glycosidic link (see p. 178). In the former case, the sugar chain is attached to the amide group of an asparagine side chain and, in the latter case, to the hydroxyl group of either a serine or threonine side chain. [Note: In the case of collagen, there is an O-glycosidic linkage between galactose or glucose and the hydroxyl group of hydroxylysine (see p. 125).]\nB. N- and O-Linked oligosaccharides\nA glycoprotein may contain only one type of glycosidic linkage (N or O linked) or may have both types within the same molecule.\n 1. O-Linked:  The O-linked glycans may have one or more of a wide \nvariety of sugars arranged in either a linear or a branched pattern. Many are found in extracellular glycoproteins or as membrane glycoprotein components. For example, O-linked oligosaccharides on the surface of red blood cells help provide the ABO blood group determinants. If the terminal sugar on the glycan is GalNAc, the blood group is A. If it is galactose, the blood group is B. If neither GalNAc nor galactose is present, the blood group is O.\n 2. N-Linked:  The N-linked glycans fall into two broad classes: complex \noligosaccharides and high-mannose oligosaccharides. Both contain the same pentasaccharide core shown in \nFigure 19.14 , but the \ncomplex oligosaccharides contain a diverse group of additional sugars, for example, GlcNAc, GalNAc, \nL-fucose, and NANA, whereas \nthe high-mannose oligosaccharides contain primarily mannose.Figure 19.13\nFunctions of glycoproteins.\nGlycoproteins\nCell-surface recognition\nCell-surface antigenicity\nMucinsExtracellular matrix\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   272 24-10-2020   12:09:13"

            "Text": "VIII. Glycoprotein Synthesis 273\nVIII. GLYCOPROTEIN SYNTHESIS\nProteins destined to function in the cytoplasm are synthesized on free \ncytosolic ribosomes. However, proteins, including glycoproteins, that are destined for cellular membranes, lysosomes, or to be exported from the cell, are synthesized on ribosomes attached to the RER. These proteins contain specific signal sequences that act as molecular addresses, targeting the proteins to their proper destinations. An N-terminal hydrophobic sequence initially directs these proteins to the RER, allowing the growing polypeptide to be extruded into the lumen (see p. 642). The proteins are then trans-ported via secretory vesicles to the Golgi, which acts as a sorting center (\nFig. 19.15 ). In the Golgi, those glycoproteins that are to be secreted from \nthe cell (or are targeted for lysosomes) are packaged into vesicles that fuse with the cell (or lysosomal) membrane and release their contents. Those that are destined to become components of the cell membrane are inte-grated into the Golgi membrane, which buds off, forming vesicles that add their membrane-bound glycoproteins to the cell membrane. [Note: Therefore, the membrane glycoproteins are oriented with the carbohydrate portion on the outside of the cell (see \nFig. 19.15 ).]\nA. Carbohydrate components\nThe precursors of the carbohydrate components of glycoproteins are nucleotide sugars, which include UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc. In addition, guanosine diphos-phate (GDP)-mannose, GDP-\nL-fucose (which is synthesized from \nGDP-mannose), and CMP-NANA may donate sugars to the growing chain. [Note: When the acidic NANA is present, the oligosaccharide has a negative charge at physiologic pH.] The oligosaccharides are covalently attached to the side chains of specific amino acids in the protein, where the three-dimensional structure of the protein deter-mines whether or not a specific amino acid is glycosylated.\nB. O-Linked glycoprotein synthesis\nSynthesis of the O-linked glycoproteins is very similar to that of the GAG (see p. 265). First, the protein to which sugars are to be attached is synthesized on the RER and extruded into its lumen. Glycosylation begins with the transfer of GalNAc (from UDP-GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of a specific serine or threonine residues. The glycosyltransfer-\nases responsible for the stepwise synthesis (from individual sugars) of \nthe oligosaccharides are bound to the membranes of the Golgi. They act in a specific order, without using a template as is required for DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein synthesis (see Unit VIII), but instead by recognizing the actual structure of the growing oligosaccharide as the appropriate substrate.\nC. N-Linked glycoprotein synthesis\nSynthesis of N-linked glycoproteins occurs in the lumen of the RER and requires the participation of the phosphorylated form of dolichol (doli-chol pyrophosphate), a lipid of the RER membrane (\nFig. 19.16 ). The \ninitial product is processed in the RER and Golgi.Figure 19.14\nComplex (top) and high-mannose \n(bottom) N-linked oligosaccharides.

Dolichol-linked oligosaccharide synthesis:  As with the O-linked \nglycoproteins, the protein is synthesized on the RER and enters its lumen. However, it does not become glycosylated with individual sugars. Instead, a lipid-linked oligosaccharide is first constructed. This consists of dolichol (an RER membrane lipid made from an intermediate of cholesterol synthesis; see p. 344) attached through a pyrophosphate linkage to an oligosaccharide containing GlcNAc, mannose, and glucose. The sugars to be added sequentially to the dolichol by membrane-bound glycosyltransferases  are first GlcNAc, \nfollowed by mannose and glucose (see \nFig. 19.16 ). The entire \n14-sugar oligosaccharide is then transferred from dolichol to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the protein to be glyco-sylated by a protein\u2013oligosaccharide transferase  present in the RER. \n[Note: Tunicamycin inhibits N-linked glycosylation.]\nCongenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are syndromes \ncaused primarily by defects in the N-linked glycosylation of proteins, either oligosaccharide assembly (type I) or processing (type II).\n 2. N-Linked oligosaccharide processing:  After addition to the \nprotein, the N-linked oligosaccharide is processed by the removal of specific mannosyl and glucosyl residues as the glycoprotein moves through the RER. Finally, the oligosaccharide chains are completed in the Golgi by addition of a variety of sugars (for example, GlcNAc, GalNAc, and additional mannoses and then fucose or NANA as terminal groups) to produce a complex glycoprotein. Alternatively, they are not processed further, leaving branched, mannose-containing chains in a high-mannose glycoprotein (see \nFig. 19.16 ). \nThe ultimate fate of N-linked glycoproteins is the same as that of the O-linked glycoproteins (for example, they can be released by the cell or become part of a cell membrane). In addition, N-linked glycopro-teins can be targeted to the lysosomes. [Note: Nonenzymatic glyco-sylation of proteins is known as glycation (see p. 111).] \n 3. Lysosomal enzymes:  N-Linked glycoproteins being processed \nin the Golgi can be phosphorylated on carbon 6 of one or more mannosyl residues. UDP-GlcNAc provides the phosphate in a reac-tion catalyzed by a phosphotransferase . Receptors, located in the \nGolgi membrane, bind the mannose 6-phosphate residues of these proteins, which are then packaged into vesicles and sent to the lysosomes (\nFig. 19.17 ). I-Cell disease is a rare lysosomal storage \ndisease in which the phosphotransferase  is deficient. This causes \nthe proteins to be secreted, rather than being targeted to lyso-somes. Consequently, the acid hydrolases  normally found in the \nlysosomal matrix are absent, resulting in an accumulation of the substrates for these missing enzymes. [Note: I-Cell disease is so named because of the large inclusion bodies seen in cells of patients with this disease.] In addition, high amounts of lysosomal enzymes are found in the patient\u2019s plasma and urine, indica ting that \nthe targeting process to lysosomes (rather than the synthetic pathway of these enzymes) is deficient. I-Cell disease is characterized by skeletal \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   274 24-10-2020   12:09:14"

LYSOSOMAL GLYCOPROTEIN DEGRADATION\nDegradation of glycoproteins is similar to that of the GAG (see p. 270). The lysosomal acid hydrolases  are each generally specific for the removal of \none component of the glycoprotein. They are primarily exoenzymes that remove their respective groups in the reverse order of their incorporation (last on, first off). If any one degradative enzyme is missing, degradation by the other exoenzymes cannot continue. A group of very rare autosomal-recessive diseases called the glycoprotein storage diseases (oligosacchari-doses), caused by a deficiency of any one of the degradative enzymes, results in accumulation of partially degraded structures in the lysosomes. For example, \u03b1-mannosidosis type 3 is a severe, progressive, fatal defi-\nciency of the enzyme \u03b1-mannosidase . Presentation is similar to Hurler \nsyndrome, but immune deficiency is also seen. Mannose-rich oligosaccha-ride fragments appear in the urine.

Chapter Summary\nGlycosaminoglycans  (GAG ) are long, negatively charged , unbranched , heteropolysaccharide chains  generally \ncomposed of a repeating disaccharide unit  [acidic sugar\u2013amino sugar] n (Fig. 19.18 ). The amino sugar  is either D-glucos-\namine  or D-galactosamine  in which the amino group is usually acetylated, thus eliminating its positive charge. The amino \nsugar may also be sulfated  on carbon 4 or 6 or on a nonacetylated nitrogen. The acidic sugar  is either D-glucuronic acid  \nor its C-5 epimer L-iduronic acid . GAG bind large amounts of water, thereby producing the gel-like matrix that forms the \nbasis of the body\u2019s ground substance . The viscous, lubricating properties of mucous secretions  are also caused by the \npresence of GAG, which led to the original naming of these compounds as mucopolysaccharides . There are six major \ntypes of GAG, including chondroitin 4-  and 6-sulfates , keratan sulfate , dermatan sulfate , heparin , heparan sulfate , \nand hyaluronic acid (HA) . All GAG, except HA, are found covalently attached to a core protein , forming proteoglycan \nmonomers . Many proteoglycan monomers associate with a molecule of HA to form proteoglycan aggregates . GAG \nare synthesized in the Golgi . The polysaccharide chains are elongated by the sequential addition of alternating acidic \nand amino sugars, donated by their UDP derivatives . D-Glucuronate may be epimerized to L-iduronate . The last step \nin synthesis is sulfation of some of the amino sugars. The source of the sulfate is 3\u2019-phosphoadenosyl-5 \u2019-phosphosul-\nfate (PAPS ). The completed proteoglycans are secreted into the extracellular matrix  (ECM ) or remain associated with \nthe outer surface of cells. GAG are degraded by lysosomal acid hydrolases . They are first broken down to oligosaccha-\nrides, which are degraded sequentially from the nonreducing end of each chain. A deficiency of any one of the hydrolases  \nresults in a mucopolysaccharidosis . These are hereditary disorders in which GAG accumulate in tissues, causing symp-\ntoms such as skeletal  and ECM deformities  and intellectual disability . Examples of these genetic diseases include \nHunter  (X-linked) and Hurler syndromes . Glycoproteins  are proteins to which oligosaccharides  (glycans ) are cova-\nlently attached. They differ from the proteoglycans in that the length of the glycoprotein\u2019s carbohydrate chain is relatively short (usually two to ten sugar residues long, although it can be longer), may be branched, and does not contain serial disaccharide units. Membrane-bound  glycoproteins participate in a broad range of cellular phenomena, including cell-\nsurface recognition  (by other cells, hormones, and viruses), cell-surface antigenicity  (such as the blood group anti-\ngens), and as components of the ECM and of the mucins  of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, where they act \nas protective biologic lubricants. In addition, almost all of the globular proteins present in human plasma are glycopro-teins. Glycoproteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum  (RER ) and the Golgi . The precursors of the \ncarbohydrate components of glycoproteins are nucleotide sugars . O-Linked glycoproteins  are synthesized in the Golgi \nby the sequential transfer of sugars from their nucleotide carriers to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue in the protein. N-Linked glycoproteins  are synthesized by the transfer of a preformed oligosaccharide from its RER \nmembrane lipid carrier, dolichol pyrophosphate , to the amide N of an asparagine residue in the protein. They contain \nvarying amounts of mannose . A deficiency in the phosphotransferase  that phosphorylates mannose residues at carbon \n6 in N-linked glycoprotein enzymes destined for the lysosomes results in I-cell disease . Glycoproteins are degraded in \nlysosomes by acid hydrolases . A deficiency of any one of these enzymes results in a lysosomal glycoprotein storage \ndisease  (oligosaccharidosis ), resulting in accumulation of partially degraded structures in the lysosome.X. Medical Perspectives\nMucopolysaccaridoses are a rare group of inherited conditions. Signs and symptoms and the severity of the condition vary \nsignificantly by the type of disorder. In general, most affected people appear healthy at birth and have normal development initially. However, as condition progresses, there is a decline in physical and/or mental function. The two main treatment opti ons \nfor MPS include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). For MPS I, Aldurazyme is approved as ERT. However, as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, problems with mental development persist. Galsulfase is approved for the treatment of MPS VI. Sialic acid supplementation is being tried in N-Acetylneuraminic Acid Synthase (NANS) \ndeficiency. As sialic acid is available in breast milk and common foodstuffs, its supplementation is considered a safe option.\nHeparin acts as an anticoagulant. Heparin is clinically used in patients for anticoagulation in several conditions such as \nacute coronary syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. It is also used as anticoagulant in vitro for blood sample collection when non-clotted whole blood or plasma is required for analysis.\nHeparan sulfate regulates the interactions between cells, and between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM), by binding them-\nselves to matrix macromolecules such as fibronectin or laminin. HS and heparin also have a preventive role in metastases and wound healing.\nHyaluronic acid is added to ophthalmic formulations to enhance hydration and lubrication of the eye, promote wound \nhealing, or extend drug residence time. HA has also been found to be beneficial for the treatment of joint and skin diseases, and for wound healing. HA and its synthetic derivatives can be used as 3D scaf fold structures, providing phys-\nical support for in vitro cell culture efforts. HA-based formulations are also used for cosmetic uses, for antiwrinkle effect. HA is \nbeing studied as a potential drug delivery system.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   277 24-10-2020   12:09:28"

Describe the structure and synthesis of glycoproteins.\nClinical Case Question\nCorrect answer = A.  The mucopolysaccharidoses are \ncaused by deficiencies in any one of the lysosomal acid hydrolases  responsible for the degradation of glycos-\naminoglycans (not proteins). The enzyme is correctly targeted to the lysosome, so blood levels of the enzyme do not increase, but it is nonfunctional. In these diseases, synthesis of the protein and carbohydrate components of proteoglycans is unaffected, in terms of both structure and amount.19.1. Mucopolysaccharidoses are hereditary lysosomal \nstorage diseases. They are caused by:\nA. defects in the degradation of \nglycosaminoglycans.\nB. defects in the targeting of enzymes to \nlysosomes.\nC. an increased rate of synthesis of the carbohy-\ndrate component of proteoglycans.\nD. an insufficient rate of synthesis of proteolytic \nenzymes.\nE. the synthesis of abnormally small amounts of \ncore proteins.\nF . the synthesis of heteropolysaccharides with an \naltered structure.Answer\u2014A:  This is a case of Hunter syndrome. Coarsening \nof facial features, macrocephaly, broad noses with flared nostrils, prominent supraorbital ridges, thick lips and large tongue are common features of this disease. The skin of these patients is inelastic and thickened. Mobility of joints is restricted. GAG storage leads to hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Umbilical hernia is commonly observed. Analysis of urine GAG levels can be used to confirm MPS.\n It may be type A classic severe form or type B milder \nform. In type A, clinical features are apparent in the first year of life; somatic and neurologic development is slow with severe mental retardation. In type B, there is mild mental retardation, but intelligence is usually normal, and progression of the disease is very slow.\nAnswer\u2014B:  In Hunter syndrome, there is deficiency in \nthe activity of lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase. GAG are partially degraded or remains undegraded and get accumulated within the lysosomes and is excreted in urine.19.1. A 10-year-old boy presented with a chief complaint \nof irregularly placed front teeth. Dental history did not reveal delay or early eruption of milk teeth. Patient\u2019s parents gave history of frequent episodes of seizures from the age of 8 years and a surgery for inguinal hernia on right side last year. His brother had similar complaint of inguinal hernia. Family history revealed early death of his mother\u2019s two siblings at the age of 13 years.\n On general physical examination, patient had \ngrowth retardation, macrocephaly with bilat-eral temporal and frontal bossing, coarse facial features and depressed nasal bridge. He had claw like hands and stiff joints. Skin of extremities was thickened and inelastic. Physical examination also revealed protruded abdomen and hepatospleno-megaly. Corneal clouding was not seen. Urine analysis showed the presence of GAGs. Serum alkaline phosphatase  level was increased.\nA. What is the most probable diagnosis?\nB.

Because sulfation is the last step in the synthesis of this sequence, a sulfatase is required for the next step in the degradation of the compound shown.\nCorrect answer = B.  I-Cell disease is a lysosomal storage \ndisease caused by deficiency of the phosphotransferase  \nneeded for synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate signal that targets acid hydrolases  to the lysosomal matrix. This \nresults in secretion of these enzymes from the cell and accumulation of materials within the lysosome because of impaired degradation. None of the other choices relates to I-cell disease or lysosomal function. Oligosaccharides in the urine are characteristic of the muco- and polysac-charidoses but not I-cell disease (a type II mucolipidosis).19.2.

An 8-month-old boy with coarse facial features, \nskeletal abnormalities, and delays in both growth and development is diagnosed with I-cell disease based on his presentation and on histologic and biochemical testing. I-cell disease is characterized by:\nA. decreased production of cell surface O-linked \nglycoproteins.\nB. elevated levels of acid hydrolases  in the blood.\nC. inability to N-glycosylate proteins.D. increased synthesis of proteoglycans.E. oligosaccharides in the urine.\nCorrect answer = A.  Hurler syndrome, a defect in the \nlysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) with corneal clouding, is due to a deficiency in \u03b1-\nL-iduronidase. \n\u03b2-Glucuronidase is deficient in Sly syndrome, and \niduronate sulfatase is deficient in Hunter syndrome. Glycosyltransferases  are enzymes of GAG synthesis.19.4. An infant with corneal clouding has dermatan \nsulfate and heparan sulfate in his urine. Decreased activity of which of the enzymes listed below would confirm the suspected diagnosis of Hurler syndrome?\nA. \u03b1-\nL-Iduronidase\nB. \u03b1-Glucuronidase\nC. GlycosyltransferaseD. Iduronate sulfatase\n19.5. Distinguish between glycoproteins and \nproteoglycans.\nAnswer:  Glycoproteins are proteins to which short, \nbranched, structurally diverse oligosaccharide chains (glycans) are attached. Proteoglycans consist of a core protein to which long, unbranched, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. GAG are large complexes of negatively charged heteropolysaccharides composed of repeating [acidic sugar-amino sugar]\nn disaccharide units.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   280 24-10-2020   12:09:33"

            "Text": "Unit Overview\nLipids are a heterogenous group of water-insoluble molecules, whereas the body is mostly having aqueous solutions \nlike blood and cell cytosol. The lipids help to compartmentalize the cell\u2019s internal milieu (see p. 20), are stored for energy in adipocytes (see p. 306) and are transported as lipoproteins (see Fig. 23.17, p. 353) in blood. Lipids are stored as triacylglycerol for energy (see p. 305), make steroid hormones (see Fig. 23.24, p. 361) and important compounds like eicosanoids and prostaglandins (see p. 331) and are involved in metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins. Chapter 20 deals with the digestion and absorption of lipids.\n Lipids are synthesized from acetyl CoA (which occupies a central role in intermediary metabolism) whenever there \nis excess production of acetyl CoA. This situation of excess acetyl CoA favors synthesis of fatty acids (promoted by insulin), which are stored as triacylglycerol (TAG) (Chapter 21). Increased storage of TAG leads to obesity.\n When body needs energy and glycogen stores have been depleted (starvation, diabetes), this stored triacylglycerol \nis broken down to acetyl CoA in presence of hormones like glucagon. However, all of this acetyl CoA cannot be sent to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as the oxaloacetate (first step of TCA cycle) is being used for gluconeogenesis in these conditions. So now the excess acetyl CoA (generated from breaking down triacylglycerol) will start forming ketone bodies to get whatever energy it can (chapter 21). Further, lipids make certain special compounds like phospholipids, prostaglandins, eicosanoids and sphingomyelins (chapter 22) for various designated roles in membranes, surfactants, myelin, etc. The student will do well to understand that the synthesis of TAG from acetyl CoA and breakdown of TAG to acetyl CoA is happening inside cells, whereas the lipoprotein assisted transfer of cholesterol and triglycerides is happening in blood.\n Lipoproteins transfer lipids from intestine to liver as well as from liver to all parts of body (chapter 23). They \n(low-density lipoprotein) give cholesterol to tissues so that steroid hormones can be made, and various components of cell membrane and cell structure can be maintained. The excess cholesterol is brought back to liver by high-density lipoprotein to break cholesterol to bile for excretion. However, in certain disease conditions like atherosclerosis (chapter 23) the excess lipoproteins get modified and deposited in arterial vessel walls to form plaques. These atherosclerotic plaques may be stable or vulnerable to rupture and thrombus formation. If thrombi are released from plaques, it may block end arteries like the ones in myocardium and cause angina or myocardial infarction which is an emergency situation. Such thrombi also cause ischemia in brain leading to stroke and paralytic events.\n Hence it is very important to control lipid levels. The suggested normal ranges to be achieved by lifestyle modifications \nand drugs (if required) are given in the appendix for this unit. The primary healthcare physician must understand the central role of lipids and integrated metabolism in controlling the epidemic of coronary artery disease that is surging in India and advise patients accordingly.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   286 24-10-2020   12:09:33"

OVERVIEW\nLipids are a heterogeneous group of water-insoluble (hydrophobic) organic \nmolecules ( Fig. 20.1 ). Because of their insolubility in aqueous solutions, \nbody lipids are generally found compartmentalized, as in the case of membrane-associated lipids or droplets of triacylglycerol in adipocytes, or transported in blood in association with protein, as in lipoprotein particles (see p. 350) or on albumin. Lipids may be simple, compound, derived or  \ncomplexed to other compounds (see p. 288, blue box: Classification of Lipids). Lipids are a major source of energy for the body, and they also provide the hydrophobic barrier that permits partitioning of the aqueous contents of cells and subcellular structures. Lipids serve additional func-tions in the body (for example, some fat-soluble vitamins have regulatory or coenzyme functions, and the prostaglandins and steroid hormones play major roles in the control of the body\u2019s homeostasis, see p. 288, blue box: Functions of Lipids). Deficiencies or imbalances of lipid metabolism can lead to some of the major clinical problems encountered by physicians, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity.\nII.  DIGESTION, ABSORPTION, SECRETION, \nAND UTILIZATION\nThe average daily intake of lipids by U.S. adults is ~78 g, of which >90% \nis triacylglycerol ([TAG], formerly called triglyceride [TG]), that consists of three fatty acids (FA) esterified to a glycerol backbone (\nFig. 20.1 ).

CF is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations to the gene for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that functions as a chloride channel on epithelium in the pancreas, lungs, testes, and sweat glands. Defective CFTR results in decreased secretion of chloride and increased uptake of sodium and water. In the pancreas, the depletion of water on the cell surface results in thickened mucus that clogs the pancreatic ducts, preventing pancre-atic enzymes from reaching the intestine, thereby leading to pancre-atic insufficiency. Treatment includes replacement of these enzymes and supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins.

Emulsification in the small intestine\nThe critical process of dietary lipid emulsification occurs in the \nduodenum. Emulsification increases the surface area of the hydrophobic lipid droplets so that the digestive enzymes, which work at the interface of the droplet and the surrounding aqueous solution, can act effectively. Emulsification is accomplished by two complementary mechanisms, namely, use of the detergent properties of the conjugated bile salts and mechanical mixing due to peristalsis. Bile salts, made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are amphipathic derivatives of cholesterol (see Fig. 23.11, p. 349). Conjugated bile salts consist of a hydroxylated sterol ring structure with a side chain to which a molecule of glycine or taurine is covalently attached by an amide linkage (\nFig. 20.3 ). These emulsifying \nagents interact with the dietary lipid droplets and the aqueous duodenal contents, thereby stabilizing the droplets as they become smaller from peristalsis and preventing them from coalescing. [Note: See p. 225 for a more complete discussion of bile salt metabolism.]\nD. Degradation by pancreatic enzymes\nThe dietary TAG, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids are enzymati-cally degraded (digested) in the small intestine by pancreatic enzymes, whose secretion is hormonally controlled.\n 1. Triacylglycerol degradation:  TAG molecules are too large to be \ntaken up efficiently by the mucosal cells (enterocytes) of the intes-tinal villi. Therefore, they are hydrolyzed by an esterase , pancreatic \nlipase , which preferentially removes the FA at carbons 1 and 3. The \nprimary products of hydrolysis are, thus, a mixture of 2-monoacyl-glycerol (2-MAG) and FFA (see \nFig. 20.2 ). [Note: Pancreatic lipase  \nis found in high concentrations in pancreatic secretions (2%\u20133% of the total protein present), and it is highly efficient catalytically, thus insuring that only severe pancreatic deficiency, such as that seen in CF , results in significant malabsorption of fat.] A second protein, colipase , also secreted by the pancreas, binds the lipase  at \na ratio of 1:1 and anchors it at the lipid\u2013aqueous interface. Colipase  \nrestores activity to lipase  in the presence of inhibitory substances \nlike bile salts that bind the micelles. [Note: Colipase  is secreted as \nthe zymogen, procolipase, which is activated in the intestine by trypsin .] Orlistat, an antiobesity drug, inhibits gastric  and pancreatic \nlipases , thereby decreasing fat absorption, resulting in weight loss.\n 2. Cholesteryl ester degradation:  Most dietary cholesterol is present \nin the free (nonesterified) form, with 10%\u201315% present in the esterified form. Cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesteryl ester hydrolase  (cholesterol esterase ), which produces \ncholesterol plus FFA (see \nFig. 20.2 ). Activity of this enzyme is greatly \nincreased in the presence of bile salts.\n 3. Phospholipid degradation:  Pancreatic juice is rich in the proen-\nzyme of phospholipase A 2 that, like procolipase, is activated by \ntrypsin  and, like cholesteryl ester hydrolase , requires bile salts for \noptimum activity. Phospholipase A 2 removes one FA from carbon \n2 of a phospholipid, leaving a lysophospholipid. For example, phosphatidylcholine (the predominant phospholipid of digestion) becomes lysophosphatidylcholine. The remaining FA at carbon 1 can be removed by lysophospholipase , leaving a glycerylphosphoryl Glycocholic acid\n(a conjugated bile salt)HO OH\nHHO\nCH3\nCH3OH\nCN CH2COO\u2013Glycine Cholic acid\nFigure 20.3\nStructure of glycocholic acid.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   290 24-10-2020   12:09:34"

Control:  Pancreatic secretion of the hydrolytic enzymes that \ndegrade dietary lipids in the small intestine is hormonally controlled (\nFig. 20.4 ). Cells in the mucosa of the lower duodenum and jejunum \nproduce the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), in response to the presence of lipids and partially digested proteins entering these regions of the upper small intestine. CCK acts on the gall-bladder (causing it to contract and release bile, a mixture of bile salts, phospholipids, and free cholesterol) and on the exocrine cells of the pancreas (causing them to release digestive enzymes). It also decreases gastric motility, resulting in a slower release of gastric contents into the small intestine (see Fig. 23.4). Other intestinal cells produce another peptide hormone, secretin, in response to the low pH of the chyme entering the intestine from the stomach. Secretin causes the pancreas to release a solution rich in bicarbonate that helps neutralize the pH of the intestinal contents, bringing them to the appropriate pH for digestive activity by pancreatic enzymes.\nE. Absorption by enterocytes\nFFA, free cholesterol, and 2-MAG are the primary products of lipid digestion in the jejunum. These, plus bile salts and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), form mixed micelles (that is, disc-shaped clusters of a mixture of amphipathic lipids that coalesce with their hydrophobic groups on the inside and their hydrophilic groups on the outside). Therefore, mixed micelles are soluble in the aqueous environment of the intestinal lumen (\nFig. 20.5 ). These particles approach the primary site of \nlipid absorption, the brush border membrane of the enterocytes. This microvilli-rich apical membrane is separated from the liquid contents of the intestinal lumen by an unstirred water layer that mixes poorly with the bulk fluid. The hydrophilic surface of the micelles facilitates the transport of the hydrophobic lipids through the unstirred water layer to the brush border membrane where they are absorbed. Bile salts are absorbed in the terminal ileum, with <5% being lost in the feces. [Note: Relative to other dietary lipids, cholesterol is only poorly absorbed by the enterocytes. Drug therapy (for example, with ezetimibe) can further reduce cholesterol absorption in the small intestine.] Because short- and medium-chain FA are water soluble, they do not require the assis-tance of mixed micelles for absorption by the intestinal mucosa.\nF. Triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester resynthesis\nThe mixture of lipids absorbed by the enterocytes migrates to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) where biosynthesis of complex lipids takes place. The long-chain FA are first converted into their activated form by fatty acyl coenzyme A  (CoA) synthetase  (thiokinase ), as shown in \nFigure 20.6 . Using the fatty acyl CoA derivatives, the 2-MAG absorbed \nby the enterocytes are converted to TAG through sequential reacyl-ations by two acyltransferases , acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltrans-\nferase  and acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase . Lysophospholipids \nare reacylated to form phospholipids by a family of acyltransferases , \nand cholesterol is acylated primarily by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltrans-\nferase  (see Fig. 23.21).

Lipid malabsorption\nLipid malabsorption, resulting in increased lipid (including the fat-soluble vitamins and essential FA, see \nFig. 20.7 ) in the feces, a condition known \nas steatorrhea, can be caused by disturbances in lipid digestion and/or absorption (\nFig. 20.7 ). Such disturbances can result from several condi-\ntions, including CF (causing poor digestion) and short bowel syndrome (causing decreased absorption).\nThe ability of short- and medium-chain FA to be taken up \nby enterocytes without the aid of mixed micelles has made them important in medical nutrition therapy for individuals with malabsorption disorders.\nH. Secretion from enterocytes\nThe newly resynthesized TAG and cholesteryl esters are very hydro-\nphobic and aggregate in an aqueous environment. Therefore, they must be packaged as particles of lipid droplets surrounded by a thin layer composed of phospholipids, nonesterified cholesterol, and a molecule of the protein apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 (see p. 351). This layer stabi-lizes the particle and increases its solubility, thereby preventing multiple particles from coalescing. [Note: Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein is essential for the assembly of all TAG-rich apo B\u2013containing particles in the ER (see p. 351).] The lipoprotein particles are released by exocy-tosis from enterocytes into the lacteals (lymphatic vessels in the villi of the small intestine).

This lymph is called chyle \n(as opposed to chyme, the name given to the semifluid mass of partially digested food that passes from the stomach to the duodenum), and the particles are named chylomicrons.

Use by the tissues\nMost of the TAG contained in chylomicrons is broken down in the capil-lary beds of skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue.

Secreted LPL is anchored to the luminal surface of endothelial cells in \nthe capillaries of muscle and adipose tissues. [Note: Familial chylomi-cronemia (type I hyperlipoproteinemia) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of LPL or its coenzyme apo C-II (see \np. 351). The result is fasting chylomicronemia and severe hypertriacylg-lycerolemia, which can cause pancreatitis.]\n 1. Fate of free fatty acids:  The FFA derived from the hydrolysis of \nTAG may either directly enter adjacent muscle cells and adipocytes or be transported in the blood in association with serum albumin until they are taken up by cells. [Note: Human serum albumin is a large protein secreted by the liver. It transports a number of primarily hydrophobic compounds in the circulation, including FFA and some drugs.] Most cells can oxidize FA to produce energy (see p. 307). Adipocytes can also reesterify FFA to produce TAG mole-cules, which are stored until the FA are needed by the body (see p. 305).\n 2. Fate of glycerol:  Glycerol released from TAG is taken up from the \nblood and phosphorylated by hepatic glycerol kinase  to produce \nglycerol 3-phosphate, which can enter either glycolysis or gluconeo-genesis by oxidation to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (see p. 197) or be used in TAG synthesis (see Fig. 21.14, p. 307).\n 3. Fate of chylomicron remnants:  After most of the TAG has been \nremoved, the chylomicron remnants (which contain cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, apolipoproteins, fat-soluble vitamins, and a small amount of TAG) bind to receptors on the liver (apo E is the ligand; see Fig. 23.16, p. 352) and are endocytosed. The intracellular remnants are hydrolyzed to their component parts. Cholesterol and the nitrogenous bases of phospholipids (for example, choline) can be recycled by the body. [Note: If removal of remnants by the liver is decreased because of impaired binding to their receptor, they accu-mulate in the plasma. This is seen in the rare type III hyperlipopro-teinemia (also called familial dysbetalipoproteinemia or broad beta disease, see p. 354).]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   293 24-10-2020   12:09:36"

Chapter Summary\nDietary lipid digestion  begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine ( Fig. 20.8 ). Cholesteryl esters , phos-\npholipids , and triacylglycerols  (TAG) containing long-chain-length fatty acids  (FA) are degraded in the small intes-\ntine by pancreatic enzymes . The most important of these enzymes are cholesterol esterase , phospholipase A 2, and \npancreatic lipase . In cystic fibrosis , thickened mucus prevents these enzymes reaching the intestine. In contrast, TAG \nin milk fat  contain short-  to medium-chain-length FA  and are degraded in the stomach  by acid lipases  (lingual lipase  \nand gastric lipase ). The hydrophobic  nature of lipids requires that dietary lipids be emulsified  for efficient degrada-\ntion. Emulsification occurs in the small intestine using peristaltic action  (mechanical mixing) and bile salts  (detergents). \nThe primary products of dietary lipid degradation are 2-monoacylglycerol , nonesterified (free) cholesterol , and free FA . \nThese compounds, plus the fat-soluble vitamins , form mixed micelles  that facilitate dietary lipid absorption by intes-\ntinal mucosal cells  (enterocytes ). These cells use activated long-chain FA to regenerate TAG and cholesteryl esters \nand also synthesize protein ( apolipoprotein  [apo] B-48 ), all of which are then assembled with the fat-soluble vitamins \ninto lipoprotein particles  called chylomicrons . Short- and medium-chain FA enter blood directly. Chylomicrons are first \nreleased into the lymph  and then enter the blood , where their lipid core is degraded by lipoprotein lipase  (with apo \nC-II as the coenzyme) in the capillaries  of muscle  and adipose  tissues. Thus, dietary lipids are made available to the \nperipheral tissues. Fat maldigestion  or malabsorption causes steatorrhea  (lipid in the feces). A deficiency in the ability \nto degrade chylomicron components, or remove chylomicron remnants after TAG has been degraded, results in accu-mulation of these particles in blood.III. Medical Perspectives\nDisorders of lipid digestion and absorption could be due to intraluminal defects of impaired emulsification (deficiency of bile) and impaired pH regulation. Diseases of mucosa can be disease related (tropical sprue) or surgery related (intestinal bypass, intestinal resection).\nFat maldigestion or malabsorption causes excretion of undigested lipids in stools. This is called steatorrhea . Loss of \nfat-soluble vitamins will also be seen in lipid malabsorption. Steatorrhea may be due to tropical sprue, nontropical sprue, celiac sprue, intestinal lipodystrophy (Whipple\u2019s disease), etc. Absence or deficiency of bile also leads to steatorrhea.\nLipid malabsorption  also leads to defective absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin K. This may cause prolon-\ngation of prothrombin time. Lipid malabsorption further leads to deficiency of essential fatty acids and vitamin D. It also causes secondary hypolipoproteinemia. \nGallbladder removal  is a common surgery. If the gallbladder is removed, the liver secretes bile directly into the small \nintestine. This allows for digestion of most foods but high-volume, fatty greasy food and high-fiber foods may be difficult to digest leading to flatulence and discomfort.\nCystic fibrosis  is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations to the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane \nconductance regulator (CFTR) protein that functions as a chloride channel on epithelium in the pancreas, lungs, testes, and sweat glands. Defective CFTR results in decreased secretion of chloride ions, and increased uptake of sodium ions and water. In the pancreas, the depletion of water on the cell surface results in thickened mucus that clogs the pancre-atic ducts, preventing pancreatic enzymes from reaching the intestine, thereby leading to pancreatic insufficiency.\nPancreatic lipase inhibitors  are used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and obesity. Orlistat inhibits pancreatic and \ngastric obesity and is used as an antiobesity drug. The drug is not to be taken without medical supervision as it has many side effects.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   294 24-10-2020   12:09:36"

OVERVIEW\nCholesterol, the characteristic steroid alcohol of animal tissues, performs \na number of essential functions in the body. For example, cholesterol is \na structural component of all cell membranes, modulating their fluidity, \nand, in specialized tissues, cholesterol is a precursor of bile acids, steroid \nhormones, and vitamin D. Cholesterol is also required for nerve conduc-\ntion and signal transduction. Therefore, it is critically important that the \ncells of the body be assured an appropriate supply of cholesterol. To \nmeet this need, a complex series of transport, biosynthetic, and regula-\ntory mechanisms has evolved. The liver plays a central role in the regula-\ntion of the body\u2019s cholesterol homeostasis. For example, cholesterol enters \nthe hepatic cholesterol pool from a number of sources including dietary \ncholesterol as well as that synthesized de novo by extrahepatic tissues \nand by the liver itself. Cholesterol is eliminated from the liver as unmodified \ncholesterol in the bile, or it can be converted to bile salts that are secreted \ninto the intestinal lumen. It can also serve as a component of plasma lipo-\nproteins that carry lipids to the peripheral tissues. In humans, the balance \nbetween cholesterol influx and efflux is not precise, resulting in a gradual \ndeposition of cholesterol in the tissues, particularly in the endothelial linings \nof blood vessels. This is a potentially life-threatening occurrence when \nthe lipid deposition leads to plaque formation, causing the narrowing of \nblood vessels (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of cardio-, cerebro-, and \nperipheral vascular disease.

Patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic \ndisease resulting in a deficiency of a functional chloride transporter, have thickened mucus that impedes the flow of pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum. Emulsification occurs through peristalsis, which provides mechanical mixing, and bile salts that function as detergents. Colipase restores activity to pancreatic lipase in the presence of inhibitory bile salts that bind the micelles. Cholecystokinin is the hormone that causes contraction of the gallbladder and release of stored bile, and secretin causes release of bicarbonate.

A high fatty meal would cause the gallbladder to contract to excrete bile. A bloating, belching and flatulent response to fatty meal could be because of insufficient bile release due to obstruction. Bile is critical to digestion and absorption of fat. Bile breaks down fat to small droplets for providing a larger surface area for enzymes to act. Bile also is alkaline and neutral-izes the stomach acid for further enzymatic activity.20.1.

The triacylglycerols (TAG) in chylo-\nmicrons are degraded to fatty acids (FA) and glycerol by lipoprotein lipase on capillary endothelial surfaces in muscle and adipose tissue, thus providing a source of FA to these tissues for degradation or storage and providing glycerol for hepatic metabolism. In the duodenum, TAG are degraded to one 2-monoacylglycerol + two free FA that get absorbed. Medium- and short-chain FA enter directly into blood (not lymph), and they neither require micelles nor get packaged into chylomicrons. Because chylomicrons contain dietary lipids that were digested and absorbed, a defect in fat absorption would result in decreased production of chylomicrons.20.2.

OVERVIEW\nFatty acids exist free in the body (that is, they are nonesterified) and as \nfatty acyl esters in more complex molecules such as triacylglycerols (TAG). Actually free fatty acids are never free\u2014they are always bound to albumin. Low levels of free fatty acids (FFA) occur in all tissues, but substantial amounts can sometimes be found in the plasma, particularly during fasting. Plasma FFA (transported bound to serum albumin) are in route from their point of origin (TAG of adipose tissue or circulating lipoproteins) to their site of consumption (most tissues). FFA can be oxidized by many tissues, particularly liver and muscle, to provide energy and, in the liver, to provide the substrate for ketone body synthesis. Fatty acids are also structural components of membrane lipids, such as phospholipids and glycolipids (see p. 322). Fatty acids attached to certain proteins enhance the ability of those proteins to associate with membranes (see p. 326). Fatty acids are also precursors of the hormone-like prostaglandins (see p. 331). Esterified fatty acids, in the form of TAG stored in white adipose tissue (WAT), serve as the major energy reserve of the body. Alterations in fatty acid metab-olism are associated with obesity and diabetes. \nFigure 21.1  illustrates the \nmetabolic pathways of fatty acid synthesis and degradation and their rela-tionship to carbohydrate metabolism.\nII. FATTY ACID STRUCTURE\nA fatty acid consists of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group that has a pK\na (see p. 80) of ~4.8 ( Fig. 21.2 ). At physio-\nlogic pH, the terminal carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) ionizes, becoming \u2013COO\u2212.

            "Text": "II. Fatty Acid Structure 299\n[Note: When the pH is above the pK, the deprotonated form predominates \n(see p. 81).] This anionic group has an affinity for water, giving the fatty acid its amphipathic nature (having both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic region). However, for long-chain-length fatty acids (LCFA), the hydrophobic portion is predominant. These molecules are highly water insoluble and must be transported in the circulation in association with protein. More than 90% of the fatty acids found in plasma are in the form of fatty acid esters (primarily TAG, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids) contained in circu-lating lipoprotein particles (see p. 350). FFA are transported in the circula-tion in association with albumin, the most abundant protein in serum.\nA. Fatty acid saturation\nFatty acid chains may contain no double bonds (that is, be saturated) or contain one or more double bonds (that is, be mono- or polyunsatu-rated). In humans, the majority are saturated or monounsaturated. When double bonds are present, they are nearly always in the cis rather than in the trans configuration. The introduction of a cis double bond causes the fatty acid to bend or kink at that position (\nFig. 21.3 ). If the fatty acid \nhas two or more double bonds, they are always spaced at three-carbon intervals. [Note: In general, addition of double bonds decreases the melting temperature (T\nm) of a fatty acid, whereas increasing the chain \nlength increases the T m. Because membrane lipids typically contain \nLCFA, the presence of double bonds in some fatty acids helps main-tain the fluid nature of those lipids. See p. 504 for a discussion of the dietary occurrence of cis and trans unsaturated fatty acids.]\nB. Fatty acid chain length and double bond positions\nThe common names and structures of some fatty acids of physiologic importance are listed in \nFigure 21.4 . Acetic acid is found in vinegar, \nbutter has butyric and caproic acid, and coconut oil has mainly capric, lauric and myristic acid. Mustard oil has erucic acid (22:1, \u03c9-9) and \nvegetable oils have linolenic, linoleic and arachidonic acid. Brain lipids have cerebronic acid (24) and nervonic (24:1, \u03c9-9) acids. \nIn humans, fatty acids with an even number of carbon atoms (16, 18, or \n20) predominate, with longer fatty acids (>22 carbons) being found in the brain. The carbon atoms are numbered, beginning with the carbonyl carbon as carbon 1. The number before the colon indicates the number of carbons in the chain, and those after the colon indicate the numbers and positions (relative to the carboxyl end) of double bonds. For example, as denoted in \nFigure 21.4 , arachidonic acid, 20:4(5,8,11,14), \nis 20 carbons long and has four double bonds (between carbons 5\u20136, 8\u20139, 11\u201312, and 14\u201315). [Note: Carbon 2, the carbon to which the carboxyl group is attached, is also called the \u03b1-carbon, carbon 3 is \nthe \u03b2-carbon, and carbon 4 is the \u03b3-carbon. The carbon of the terminal \nmethyl group is called the \u03c9-carbon regardless of the chain length.] \nThe double bonds in a fatty acid can also be referenced relative to the \u03c9 (methyl) end of the chain. Arachidonic acid is referred to as an \u03c9-6 \nfatty acid because the terminal double bond is six bonds from the \u03c9 \nend (\nFig. 21.5A ). [Note: The equivalent designation of n-6 may also be \nused ( Fig. 21.5B ).] Another \u03c9-6 fatty acid is the essential linoleic acid \n18:2(9,12). In contrast, \u03b1-linolenic acid, 18:3(9,12,15), is an essential \n\u03c9-3 fatty acid.\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)  are the fatty acids having two \nor more double bonds, e.g., arachidonic acid.

They are also responsible for fluidity of membranes and \nare also precursors for synthesis of other important compounds like eicosanoids.\nC. Essential fatty acids\nLinoleic acid, the precursor of \u03c9-6 arachidonic acid that is the substrate \nfor prostaglandin synthesis (see p. 331), and \u03b1-linolenic acid, the \nprecursor of \u03c9-3 fatty acids that are important for growth and develop-\nment, are dietary essentials in humans because we lack the enzymes needed to synthesize them. Plants provide us with these essential fatty acids. [Note: Arachidonic acid becomes essential if linoleic acid is defi-cient in the diet. See p. 505 for a discussion of the nutritional signifi-cance of \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 fatty acids.]\nEssential fatty acid deficiency (rare) can result in a dry, scaly \ndermatitis as a result of an inability to synthesize molecules that provide the water barrier in skin (see p. 326).\nIII. FATTY ACID DE NOVO SYNTHESIS\nCarbohydrates and proteins obtained from the diet in excess of the body\u2019s \nneeds for these nutrients can be converted to fatty acids. In adults, de novo fatty acid synthesis occurs primarily in the liver and lactating mammary glands and, to a lesser extent, in adipose tissue. This cytosolic process is endergonic (see p. 160) and reductive. It incorporates carbons from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) into the growing fatty acid chain, using ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). [Note: Dietary TAG also supply fatty acids. See p. 451 for a discussion of the metabolism of dietary nutrients in the well-fed state.]\nA. Cytosolic acetyl CoA production\nThe first step in fatty acid synthesis is the transfer of acetate units from mitochondrial acetyl CoA to the cytosol. Mitochondrial acetyl CoA is produced by the oxidation of pyruvate (see p. 207) and by the catab-olism of certain amino acids (see p. 401). However, the CoA portion of acetyl CoA cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, and only the acetyl portion enters the cytosol. It does so as part of citrate produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate (OAA) by citrate synthase  (\nFig. 21.6 ). [Note: The transport of citrate to the \ncytosol occurs when the mitochondrial citrate concentration is high. This is observed when isocitrate dehydrogenase  of the tricarboxylic \nacid (TCA) cycle is inhibited by the presence of large amounts of ATP , causing citrate and isocitrate to accumulate (see p. 209). Therefore, cytosolic citrate may be viewed as a high-energy signal. Because a large amount of ATP is needed for fatty acid synthesis, the increase in both ATP and citrate enhances this pathway.] In the cytosol, citrate is cleaved to OAA and acetyl CoA by ATP citrate lyase .\nB. Acetyl CoA carboxylation to malonyl CoA\nThe energy for the carbon-to-carbon condensations in fatty acid \nsynthesis is supplied by the carboxylation and then decarboxylation of acyl groups in the cytosol.

            "Text": "III. Fatty Acid De Novo Synthesis 301\nmalonyl CoA is catalyzed by acetyl CoA carboxylase  (ACC ) (Fig. 21.7 ). \nACC  transfers carbon dioxide (CO 2) from bicarbonate (HCO 3\u2013) in an \nATP-requiring reaction. The coenzyme is biotin (vitamin B 7), which is \ncovalently bound to a lysyl residue of the carboxylase  (see Fig. 32.16, \np. 533). ACC  carboxylates the bound biotin, which transfers the acti-\nvated carboxyl group to acetyl CoA.\n 1. Acetyl CoA carboxylase short-term regulation:  This carboxyl-\nation is both the rate-limiting and the regulated step in fatty acid synthesis (see \nFig. 21.7 ). The inactive form of ACC  is a protomer \n(complex of \u22652 polypeptides). The enzyme is allosterically activated by citrate, which causes protomers to polymerize, and allosteri-cally inactivated by palmitoyl CoA (the end product of the pathway), which causes depolymerization. A second mechanism of short-term regulation is by reversible phosphorylation. Adenosine monophos-\nphate\u2013activated protein kinase  (AMPK ) phosphorylates and inac-\ntivates ACC . AMPK  itself is activated allosterically by AMP and \ncovalently by phosphorylation via several kinases . At least one of \nthese AMPK kinases  is activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP)\u2013dependent \nprotein kinase A  (PKA). Thus, in the presence of counterregulatory \nhormones, such as epinephrine and glucagon, ACC  is phosphor-\nylated and inactive (\nFig. 21.8 ). In the presence of insulin, ACC  is \ndephosphorylated and active. [Note: This is analogous to the regu-lation of glycogen synthase  (see p. 232).]\n 2. Acetyl CoA carboxylase long-term regulation:  Prolonged \nconsumption of a diet containing excess calories (particularly high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets) causes an increase in ACC  synthesis, \nthereby increasing fatty acid synthesis. A low-calorie or a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet has the opposite effect. [Note: ACC  synthesis \nis upregulated by carbohydrate (specifically glucose) via the tran-scription factor carbohydrate response element\u2013binding protein (ChREBP) and by insulin via the transcription factor sterol regula-tory element\u2013binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Fatty acid synthase  \n(see C. below) is similarly regulated. The function and regulation of SREBP are described on p. 345.] Metformin, used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, lowers plasma TAG through activation of AMPK , \nresulting in inhibition of ACC  activity (by phosphorylation) and inhi-\nbition of ACC  and fatty acid synthase  expression (by decreasing \nSREBP-1c). Metformin lowers blood glucose by increasing AMPK -\nmediated glucose uptake by muscle.\nC. Eukaryotic fatty acid synthase\nThe remaining series of reactions of fatty acid synthesis in eukaryotes is catalyzed by the multifunctional, homodimeric enzyme fatty acid \nsynthase  (FAS). The process involves the addition of two carbons from \nmalonyl CoA to the carboxyl end of a series of acyl acceptors. Each FAS monomer is a multicatalytic polypeptide with six different enzymic \ndomains plus a 4 \u02b9-phosphopantetheine-containing acyl carrier protein \n(ACP) domain. 4 \u02b9-Phosphopantetheine, a derivative of pantothenic acid \n(vitamin B\n5, see p. 534), carries acyl units on its terminal thiol (\u2013SH) \ngroup and presents them to the catalytic domains of FAS during fatty \nacid synthesis. It also is a component of CoA.

Domain: Malonyl /acetyl CoA\u2013ACP transacylase .\n2. Next, this two-carbon fragment is transferred to a temporary holding \nsite, the \u2013SH group of a cysteine residue on the condensing enzyme domain (see [4] below).\n3. The now-vacant ACP accepts a three-carbon malonyl group from \nmalonyl CoA. Domain: Malonyl/acetyl CoA\u2013ACP transacylase.\n4. The acetyl group on the cysteine residue condenses with the malonyl \ngroup on ACP as the CO\n2 originally added by ACC  is released. The \nresult is a four-carbon unit attached to the ACP domain. The loss of free energy from the decarboxylation drives the reaction. Domain: 3-Ketoacyl\u2013ACP synthase , also known as condensing enzyme.\n The next three reactions convert the 3-ketoacyl group to the corre-\nsponding saturated acyl group by a pair of NADPH-requiring reduc-tions and a dehydration step.\n5. The keto group is reduced to an alcohol. Domain: 3-Ketoacyl\u2013ACP \nreductase.\n6. A molecule of water is removed, creating a trans double bond \nbetween carbons 2 and 3 (the \u03b1- and \u03b2-carbons). Domain: \n3-Hydroxyacyl\u2013ACP dehydratase.\n7. The double bond is reduced. Domain: Enoyl\u2013ACP reductase.\nThis sequence of steps results in the production of a four-carbon group \n(butyryl) whose three terminal carbons are fully saturated and which remains attached to the ACP domain. The steps are repeated (indicated by an asterisk), beginning with the transfer of the butyryl unit from the ACP to the cysteine residue [2*], the attachment of a malonyl group to the ACP [3*], and the condensation of the two groups liberating CO\n2 \n[4*]. The carbonyl group at the \u03b2-carbon (carbon 3, the third carbon from \nthe sulfur) is then reduced [5*], dehydrated [6*], and reduced [7*], gener-ating hexanoyl-ACP . This cycle of reactions is repeated five more times, each time incorporating a two-carbon unit (derived from malonyl CoA) into the growing fatty acid chain at the carboxyl end. When the fatty acid reaches a length of 16 carbons, the synthetic process is terminated with palmitoyl-S-ACP . [Note: Shorter-length fatty acids are produced in the lactating mammary gland.] Palmitoyl thioesterase , the final catalytic \nactivity of FAS, cleaves the thioester bond, releasing a fully saturated \nmolecule of palmitate (16:0). [Note: All the carbons in palmitic acid have passed through malonyl CoA except the two donated by the original acetyl CoA (the first acyl acceptor), which are found at the methyl ( \u03c9) \nend of the fatty acid. This underscores the rate-limiting nature of the ACC  reaction.]\nD. Reductant sources\nThe synthesis of one palmitate requires 14 NADPH, a reductant \n(reducing agent). The pentose phosphate pathway (see p. 250) is a major supplier of the NADPH. Two NADPH are produced for each molecule of glucose 6-phosphate that enters this pathway. The cyto-solic conversion of malate to pyruvate, in which malate is oxidized and decarboxylated by cytosolic malic enzyme  (NADP\n+-dependent malate \ndehydrogenase ), also produces cytosolic NADPH (and CO 2), as shown \nin Figure 21.10 .

The brain \nhas additional elongation capabilities, allowing it to produce the very-long-chain fatty acids ([VLCFA] over 22 carbons) that are required for synthesis of brain lipids.\nF. Chain desaturation\nEnzymes ( fatty acyl CoA desaturases ) also present in the SER are \nresponsible for desaturating LCFA (that is, adding cis double bonds). The desaturation reactions require oxygen (O\n2), NADH, cytochrome b 5, \nand its flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-linked reductase . The fatty acid \nand the NADH get oxidized as the O 2 gets reduced to H 2O. The first \ndouble bond is typically inserted between carbons 9 and 10, producing primarily oleic acid, 18:1(9), and small amounts of palmitoleic acid, 16:1(9). A variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids can be made through additional desaturation combined with elongation.\nHumans have carbon 9, 6, 5, and 4 desaturases  but lack the \nability to introduce double bonds from carbon 10 to the \u03c9 end \nof the chain. This is the basis for the nutritional essentiality of the polyunsaturated \u03c9-6 linoleic acid and \u03c9-3 linolenic acid.\nG. Storage as triacylglycerol components\nMono-, di-, and triacylglycerols consist of one, two, or three molecules \nof fatty acid esterified to a molecule of glycerol. Fatty acids are esteri-fied through their carboxyl groups, resulting in a loss of negative charge and formation of neutral fat. [Note: An acylglycerol that is solid at room temperature is called a fat. If liquid, it is an oil.]\n 1. Arrangement:  The three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol molecule \nto form a TAG are usually not of the same type. The fatty acid on carbon 1 is typically saturated, that on carbon 2 is typically unsatu-rated, and that on carbon 3 can be either. Recall that the presence of the unsaturated fatty acid(s) decrease(s) the T\nm of the lipid. An \nexample of a TAG molecule is shown in Figure 21.12 .\n 2. Triacylglycerol storage and function:  Because TAG are only \nslightly soluble in water and cannot form stable micelles by them-selves, they coalesce within white adipocytes to form large oily droplets that are nearly anhydrous. These cytosolic lipid droplets are the major energy reserve of the body. [Note: TAG stored in brown adipocytes serve as a source of heat through nonshivering thermogenesis (see p. 170).]\n 3. Glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis:  Glycerol 3-phosphate is the initial \nacceptor of fatty acids during TAG synthesis. There are two major pathways for its production (\nFig. 21.13 ). [Note: A third process (glyc-\neroneogenesis) is described on p. 307.] In both liver (the primary site of TAG synthesis) and adipose tissue, glycerol 3-phosphate can be produced from glucose, first using the reactions of the glyco-lytic pathway to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate ([DHAP], see p. 196). DHAP is reduced by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydroge-\nnase  to glycerol 3-phosphate. A second pathway found in the liver, \nbut not in adipose tissue, uses glycerol kinase  to convert free glyc-\nerol to glycerol 3-phosphate (see \nFig. 21.13 ).

Fatty acid activation:  A free fatty acid must be converted to its \nactivated form (bound to CoA through a thioester link) before it can participate in metabolic processes such as TAG synthesis. This reaction, illustrated in Figure 20.6 on p. 292, is catalyzed by a family of fatty acyl CoA synthetases  (thiokinases ).\n 5. Triacylglycerol synthesis:  This pathway from glycerol 3-phos-\nphate involves four reactions, shown in \nFigure 21.14 . These include \nthe sequential addition of two fatty acids from fatty acyl CoA, the removal of phosphate, and the addition of the third fatty acid.\nH. Triacylglycerol fate in liver and adipose tissue\nIn WAT, TAG is stored in a nearly anhydrous form as fat droplets in the cytosol of the cells. It serves as \u201cdepot fat,\u201d ready for mobiliza-tion when the body requires it for fuel. Little TAG is stored in healthy liver. Instead, most is exported, packaged with other lipids and apoli-poproteins to form lipoprotein particles called very-low-density lipopro-teins (VLDL). Nascent VLDL are secreted directly into the blood where they mature and function to deliver the endogenously derived lipids to the peripheral tissues. [Note: Recall from Chapter 20 that chylomi-crons carry dietary (exogenously derived) lipids. Plasma lipoproteins are discussed in Chapter 23.]\nIV.  FAT MOBILIZATION AND FATTY ACID OXIDATION\nFatty acids stored in WAT, in the form of neutral TAG, serve as the body\u2019s \nmajor fuel storage reserve. TAG provide concentrated stores of metabolic energy because they are highly reduced and largely anhydrous. The yield from the complete oxidation of fatty acids to CO\n2 and H 2O is 9 kcal/g fat \n(as compared to 4 kcal/g protein or carbohydrate, see Fig. 31.5 on p. 500).LIVER ADIPOSE TISSUEGlucose\nDihydroxyacetone phosphate\nGlycerol 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenaseNADH\nNAD+\nGlycerolGLYCOLYSIS\nGlycerol 3-phosphateADP ATPGlucose\nGlycerol 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenaseNADH\nNAD+Dihydroxyacetone phosphateGLYCOLYSIS\nGlycerol kinase Glycerol 3-phosphate\nFigure 21.13\nPathways for production of glycerol 3-phosphate in liver and adipose tissue.

            "Text": "IV. Fat Mobilization and Fatty Acid Oxidation 307\nA. Fatty acid release from fat\nThe mobilization of stored fat requires the hydrolytic release of FFA and \nglycerol from their TAG form. This process of lipolysis is achieved by lipases . It is initiated by adipose triglyceride lipase  (ATGL ), which gener-\nates a diacylglycerol that is the preferred substrate for hormone-sensi-\ntive lipase  (HSL). The monoacylglycerol (MAG) product of HSL is acted \nupon by MAG lipase .\n 1. Hormone-sensitive lipase regulation:  HSL is active when phos-\nphorylated by PKA, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase . cAMP is \nproduced in the adipocyte when catecholamines (such as epineph-rine) bind to cell membrane \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and activate \nadenylyl cyclase  (\nFig. 21.15 ). The process is similar to that of the \nactivation of glycogen phosphorylase  (see Fig. 16.9, p. 232). [Note: \nBecause ACC  is inhibited by hormone-directed phosphorylation, \nwhen the cAMP-mediated cascade is activated (see Fig. 21.8 ), fatty \nacid synthesis is turned off and TAG degradation is turned on.] In the presence of high plasma levels of insulin, HSL is dephosphory-\nlated and inactivated. Insulin also suppresses expression of ATGL . \n[Note: Fat droplets are coated by a protein (perilipin) that limits access of HSL. Phosphorylation of perilipin by PKA allows translo-\ncation and binding of phosphorylated HSL to the droplet.]\n 2. Fate of glycerol:  The glycerol released during TAG degradation \ncannot be metabolized by adipocytes because they lack glycerol \nkinase . Rather, glycerol is transported through the blood to the \nliver, which has the kinase . The resulting glycerol 3-phosphate can \nbe used to form TAG in the liver or can be converted to DHAP by reversal of the glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  reaction \nillustrated in \nFigure 21.13 . DHAP can participate in glycolysis or \ngluconeogenesis.\n 3. Fate of fatty acids:  The FFA move through the cell membrane of \nthe adipocyte and bind to serum albumin. They are transported to tissues such as muscle, enter cells, get activated to their CoA deriv-atives, and are oxidized for energy in mitochondria. Regardless of their levels, plasma FFA cannot be used for fuel by red blood cells (RBC), which have no mitochondria. The brain does not use fatty acids for energy to any appreciable extent, but the reasons are less clear. [Note: Over 50% of the fatty acids released from adipose TAG are reesterified to glycerol 3-phosphate. WAT does not express glycerol kinase , and the glycerol 3-phosphate is produced by glyc-\neroneogenesis, an incomplete version of gluconeogenesis: pyruvate to OAA via pyruvate carboxylase  and OAA to phosphoenolpyruvate \n(PEP) via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase . The PEP is converted \n(by reactions common to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) to DHAP, which is reduced to glycerol 3-phosphate. The process decreases plasma FFA, molecules associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity (see p. 475).]\nB. Fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation\nThe major pathway for catabolism of fatty acids is a mitochondrial \npathway called \u03b2-oxidation, in which two-carbon fragments are succes-\nsively removed from the carboxyl end of the fatty acyl CoA, producing acetyl CoA, NADH, and FADH\n2.CH2 OCoA\nCR1O\nOCO\nR2\nCH2 OCR3O\nTriacylglycerol (TAG)CR3OCH2 O\nC O\nCH2OH\nDiacylglycerol (DAG)H\nC HH2O\nPiPhosphatidic acid (DAG phosphate)CH2 OCR1O\nOCO\nR2\nCH2 O O\u2013O C H\nO\u2013PCoALysophosphatidic acidCH2 OCR1O\nHO\nCH2 O O\u2013O C H\nO\u2013P\nCoA CR2O\nAcyltransferasePhosphataseAcyltransferaseAcyltransferase\nCoAGlycerol 3-phosphateCH2OH\nHO\nCH2 O O\u2013O C H\nO\u2013P\nCoA CR1O\nCR1O\nCO\nR2\nCoA\nFigure 21.14\nSynthesis of TAG.

            "Text": "308 21. Fatty Acid, Triacylglycerol, and Ketone Body Metabolism\n 1. Long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria:  After a LCFA \nenters a cell, it is converted in the cytosol to its CoA derivative by long-chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase  (thiokinase ), an enzyme of \nthe outer mitochondrial membrane. Because \u03b2-oxidation occurs in \nthe mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acid must be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is impermeable to CoA. Therefore, a specialized carrier transports the long-chain acyl group from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. This carrier is carni-tine, and this rate-limiting transport process is called the carnitine shuttle (\nFig. 21.16 ).\n a. Translocation steps:  First, the acyl group is transferred from \nCoA to carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I  (CPT-I ), an \nenzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane. [Note: CPT-I  is \nalso known as CAT-I  for carnitine acyltransferase I .] This reac-\ntion forms an acylcarnitine and regenerates free CoA. Second, the acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for free carnitine by carnitine\u2013acylcarnitine trans-locase. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2  (CPT-II , or CAT-II ), an \nenzyme of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from carnitine to CoA in the mito-chondrial matrix, thus regenerating free carnitine.\n b. Carnitine shuttle inhibitor:  Malonyl CoA inhibits CPT-I , thus \npreventing the entry of long-chain acyl groups into the mito-chondrial matrix. Therefore, when fatty acid synthesis is occur-ring in the cytosol (as indicated by the presence of malonyl CoA), the newly made palmitate cannot be transferred into mitochondria and degraded. [Note: Muscle tissue, although it does not synthesize fatty acids, contains the mitochondrial isozyme of ACC  (ACC2 ), allowing regulation of \u03b2-oxidation. The \nliver contains both isozymes.] Fatty acid oxidation is also regu-lated by the acetyl CoA/CoA ratio: As the ratio increases, the CoA-requiring thiolase  reaction decreases (\nFig. 21.17 ).\n c.

Therefore, these latter tissues are totally dependent on uptake of carnitine provided by endoge-nous synthesis or the diet and distributed by the blood. [Note: Skeletal muscle contains ~97% of all carnitine in the body.]\n d. Carnitine deficiencies:  Such deficiencies result in decreased \nability of tissues to use LCFA as a fuel. Primary carnitine defi-ciency is caused by defects in a membrane transporter that prevent uptake of carnitine by cardiac and skeletal muscle and the kidneys, causing carnitine to be excreted. Treatment includes carnitine supplementation. Secondary carnitine defi-ciency occurs primarily as a result of defects in fatty acid oxidation leading to the accumulation of acylcarnitines that are excreted in the urine, decreasing carnitine availability. Acquired secondary carnitine deficiency can be seen, for example, in patients with liver disease (decreased carnitine synthesis) or those taking the antiseizure drug valproic acid (decreased renal reabsorption). [Note: Defects in mitochondrial oxidation can also be caused by deficiencies in CPT-I  and CPT-II . CPT-I  \ndeficiency affects the liver, where an inability to use LCFA for fuel greatly impairs that tissue\u2019s ability to synthesize glucose (an endergonic process) during a fast. This can lead to severe hypoglycemia, coma, and death. CPT-II  deficiency can affect \nthe liver and cardiac and skeletal muscle. The most common (and least severe) form affects skeletal muscle. It presents as muscle weakness with myoglobinemia following prolonged exercise.

Once inside the mitochondria, \nthey are activated to their CoA derivatives by matrix enzymes and are oxidized. [Note: Medium-chain fatty acids are plentiful in human milk. Because their oxidation is not dependent on CPT-I , malonyl \nCoA is not inhibitory.]\n 3. \ud835\udec3-Oxidation reactions:  The first cycle of \u03b2-oxidation is shown in \nFigure 21.17 . It consists of a sequence of four reactions involving \nthe \u03b2-carbon (carbon 3) that results in shortening the fatty acid by \ntwo carbons at the carboxylate end. The steps include an oxidation that produces FADH\n2, a hydration, a second oxidation that produces \nNADH, and a CoA-dependent thiolytic cleavage that releases a molecule of acetyl CoA. Each step is catalyzed by enzymes with chain-length specificity. [Note: For LCFA, the last three steps are catalyzed by a trifunctional protein.] These four steps are repeated for saturated fatty acids of even-numbered carbon chains (n/2) \u2212 1 times (where n is the number of carbons), each cycle producing one acetyl CoA plus one NADH and one FADH\n2. The final cycle \nproduces two acetyl CoA. The acetyl CoA can be oxidized or used in hepatic ketogenesis (see V. below). The reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain, NADH by Complex I, and FADH\n2 by coenzyme Q (see p. 165).

Unsaturated fatty acid \ud835\udec3-oxidation:  The oxidation of unsaturated \nfatty acids generates intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for 2,3-enoyl CoA hydratase  (see \nFig. 21.17 ). Consequently, addi-\ntional enzymes are required. Oxidation of a double bond at an odd-numbered carbon, such as 18:1(9) (oleic acid), requires one additional enzyme, 3,2-enoyl CoA isomerase , which converts the \n3-cis derivative obtained after three rounds of \u03b2-oxidation to the \n2-trans derivative required by the hydratase . Oxidation of a double \nbond at an even-numbered carbon, such as 18:2(9,12) (linoleic acid), requires an NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase  in \naddition to the isomerase . [Note: Because unsaturated fatty acids \nare less reduced than saturated fatty acids, fewer reducing equiva-lents are produced by their oxidation.]\n 8. Peroxisomal \ud835\udec3-oxidation:  VLCFA \u226522 carbons in length undergo a \npreliminary \u03b2-oxidation in peroxisomes, because peroxisomes and \nnot mitochondria are the primary site of the synthetase  that activates \nfatty acids of this length. The shortened fatty acid (linked to carni-tine) diffuses to a mitochondrion for further oxidation. In contrast to mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation, the initial dehydrogenation in peroxi-\nsomes is catalyzed by a FAD-containing acyl CoA oxidase . The \nFADH\n2 produced is oxidized by O 2, which is reduced to hydrogen \nperoxide (H 2O2). Therefore, no ATP is generated from this step. The \nH2O2 is reduced to H 2O by catalase  (see p. 253). [Note: Genetic \ndefects in the ability either to target matrix proteins to peroxi-somes (resulting in Zellweger syndrome, a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder) or to transport VLCFA across the peroxisomal membrane (resulting in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy) lead to accumulation of VLCFA in the blood and tissues.]\nC. Peroxisomal \u03b1-oxidation\nBranched-chain phytanic acid, a product of chlorophyll metabolism, is \nnot a substrate for acyl CoA dehydrogenase  because of the methyl \ngroup on its \u03b2-carbon ( Fig. 21.21 ). Instead, it is hydroxylated at the \n\u03b1-carbon by phytanoyl CoA \u03b1-hydroxylase  (PhyH ); carbon 1 is released \nas CO 2; and the product, 15-carbon-long pristanal, is oxidized to pris-\ntanic acid, which is activated to its CoA derivative and undergoes \u03b2-oxidation. Refsum disease is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder \ncaused by a deficiency of peroxisomal PhyH . This results in the accu-\nmulation of phytanic acid in the plasma and tissues. The symptoms are primarily neurologic, and the treatment involves dietary restriction to halt disease progression.

KETONE BODIES: ALTERNATIVE FUEL FOR CELLS\nLiver mitochondria have the capacity to convert acetyl CoA derived \nfrom fatty acid oxidation into ketone bodies. The compounds cate-gorized as ketone bodies are acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate (also called \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate), and acetone (a nonmetabolized side product, \nFig. 21.22 ). [Note: The two functional ketone bodies are organic acids.] \nAcetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate are transported in the blood to the peripheral tissues. There they can be reconverted to acetyl CoA, which can be oxidized by the TCA cycle. Ketone bodies are important sources of energy for the peripheral tissues because they 1) are soluble in aqueous solution and, therefore, do not need to be incorporated into lipoproteins or carried by albumin as do the other lipids; 2) are produced in the liver during periods when the amount of acetyl CoA present exceeds the oxida-tive capacity of the liver; and 3) are used in proportion to their concen-tration in the blood by extrahepatic tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, the intestinal mucosa, and the renal cortex. Even the brain can use ketone bodies to help meet its energy needs if the blood levels rise suffi-ciently. Thus, ketone bodies spare glucose, which is particularly important during prolonged periods of fasting (see p. 462). [Note: Disorders of fatty acid oxidation present with the general picture of hypoketosis (because of decreased availability of acetyl CoA) and hypoglycemia (because of increased reliance on glucose for energy).]\nA. Ketone body synthesis by the liver: Ketogenesis\nDuring a fast, the liver is flooded with fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue. The resulting elevated hepatic acetyl CoA produced by fatty acid oxidation inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase  (see p. 208) and activates \npyruvate carboxylase  ([PC], see p. 218).

Fatty Acid, Triacylglycerol, and Ketone Body Metabolism\nused by the liver for gluconeogenesis rather than for the TCA cycle. \nAdditionally, fatty acid oxidation decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio, and \nthe rise in NADH shifts OAA to malate (see p. 211). The decreased avail-ability of OAA for condensation with acetyl CoA results in the increased use of acetyl CoA for ketone body synthesis. [Note: Acetyl CoA for ketogenesis is also generated by the catabolism of ketogenic amino acids (see p. 397).]\n 1. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthesis:  The first step, forma-\ntion of acetoacetyl CoA, occurs by reversal of the final thiolase  \nreaction of fatty acid oxidation (see \nFig. 21.17 ). Mitochondrial \n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  (HMG ) CoA synthase  combines a third \nmolecule of acetyl CoA with acetoacetyl CoA to produce HMG CoA. HMG CoA synthase  is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis \nof ketone bodies and is present in significant quantities only in the liver. [Note: HMG CoA is also an intermediate in cytosolic choles-terol synthesis (see p. 344). The two pathways are separated by location in, and conditions of, the cell.]\n 2. Ketone body synthesis:  HMG CoA is cleaved by HMG CoA lyase  \nto produce acetoacetate and acetyl CoA, as shown in \nFigure 21.22 . \nAcetoacetate can be reduced to form 3-hydroxybutyrate with NADH as the electron donor. [Note: Because ketone bodies are not linked to CoA, they can cross the inner mitochondrial membrane.] Acetoacetate can also spontaneously decarboxylate in the blood to form acetone, a volatile, biologically nonmetabolized compound that can be detected in the breath. The equilibrium between acetoace-tate and 3-hydroxybutyrate is determined by the NAD\n+/NADH ratio. \nBecause this ratio is low during fatty acid oxidation, 3-hydroxybu-tyrate synthesis is favored.\nB. Ketone body use by the peripheral tissues: Ketolysis\nAlthough the liver constantly synthesizes low levels of ketone bodies, their production increases during fasting when ketone bodies are needed to provide energy to the peripheral tissues. 3-Hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , \nproducing NADH (\nFig. 21.23 ). Acetoacetate is then provided with a \nCoA molecule taken from succinyl CoA by succinyl CoA:acetoacetate \nCoA transferase  (thiophorase ). This reaction is reversible, but the \nproduct, acetoacetyl CoA, is actively removed by its cleavage to two acetyl CoA by thiolase . This pulls the reaction forward. Extrahepatic \ntissues, including the brain but excluding cells lacking mitochondria (for example, RBC), efficiently oxidize acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybu-tyrate in this manner. In contrast, although the liver actively produces ketone bodies, it lacks thiophorase  and, therefore, is unable to use \nketone bodies as fuel.\nC. Excessive ketone body production in diabetes mellitus\nWhen the rate of formation of ketone bodies is greater than the rate of their use, their levels begin to rise in the blood (ketonemia) and, eventu-ally, in the urine (ketonuria). This is seen most often in cases of uncon-trolled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), where the blood concentration \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   314 24-10-2020   12:09:50"

The elevation of the ketone body concentration in the blood can result in acidemia. [Note: The carboxyl group of a ketone body has a pK\na of ~4. Therefore, each ketone body loses a proton (H+) \nas it circulates in the blood, which lowers the pH.] Also, in uncontrolled T1D, urinary loss of glucose and ketone bodies results in dehydra-tion. Therefore, the increased number of H\n+ circulating in a decreased \nvolume of plasma can cause a severe acidosis (ketoacidosis, Fig. 21.24 ) \nknown as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).] A frequent symptom of DKA is a fruity odor on the breath, which results from increased production of acetone.

Medical Perspectives\nFatty Acids and Diet \nLinoleic and linolenic acids are essential fatty acids  and must be supplied in diet as we cannot synthesize them. \nArachidonic acid is the precursor of prostaglandins and can be synthesized in body if essential fatty acids are present.\nOmega-3 fatty acids  in diet appear to decrease cardiovascular risk factors and they decrease triglyceride levels. They \nare also associated with decrease in thromboxane levels and platelet aggregation. They are found in fish, walnuts and flax seeds. \nPUFA,  though recommended as beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease, is also prone to being the target of free \nradicals generated by lipid peroxidation.\nCommon Diseases \nKetosis  may be seen in starvation and diabetes. Salient features of ketosis include Kussmaul respiration and smell of \nacetone in patient\u2019s breath. Ketone bodies in urine can be diagnosed by urine dipstick test and Rothera\u2019s test. Diabetes is one of the most common health problems in India and is discussed in detail in chapter 29. \nAlcoholism  is also a health hazard worldwide. Chronic alcoholism interferes with lipid metabolism in liver leading to \nsteatosis, fatty degeneration of the liver parenchyma, free radical damage, fatty liver and ultimately liver cirrhosis. It increases NADH/NAD ratio, glycerol 3-phosphate formation and TG synthesis. \nTrans fatty acids are isomers of normally occurring cis-fatty acids. They are produced when PUFA is hydrogenated as \nin the production of margarine. They are mostly found in junk foods. They compete with essential fatty acids and cause their deficiency. Further, because they are structurally similar to saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids are implicated in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.\nInherited Diseases \nCarnitine deficiency  may be present in preterm babies. Impaired fatty acid oxidation will lead to hypoglycemic episodes.\nInherited Deficiency of Translocase , CPT-I or CPT-II will lead to muscle cramps and hypoglycemia due to reduced fatty \nacid oxidation.\nRefsum disease  is an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disease caused by defective alpha-oxidation of fatty acids espe-\ncially phytanic acid. In this disease, phytanic acid starts accumulating in the tissues due to the deficiency of enzyme, alpha hydroxylase . The patient has signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and nerve deafness. Milk \nmust be avoided in these patients as it is a good source of phytanic acid.\nMedium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency  is the most common mitochondrial beta-oxidation defect. In periods \nof fasting, there is a deficiency of glucose. Further, the infant is unable to maintain a supply of energy by breaking down medium-chain fatty acids. Therefore, hypoketotic hypoglycemia may occur and lead to sudden infant death syndrome. The primary goal of treatment is to provide continuous carbohydrates and avoid hypoglycemia.\nToxicity\nThe unripe ackee fruit causes Jamaican vomiting sickness  because of hypoglycin present in it.

            "Text": "VII. Chapter Summary 317\nVII. Chapter Summary\nA fatty acid , generally a linear hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group, can be saturated  or unsaturated . \nTwo unsaturated fatty acids are dietary essentials: linoleic  and \u03b1-linolenic acids . Fatty acids are synthesized in the \nliver cytosol  following a meal containing excess carbohydrate and protein. Carbons used to synthesize fatty acids \nare provided by acetyl coenzyme A  (CoA), energy by ATP, and reducing equivalents by nicotinamide adenine dinu-\ncleotide phosphate  ([NADPH ], Fig. 21.25 ) provided by the pentose phosphate pathway  and malic enzyme . Citrate  \ncarries two-carbon acetyl units from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. The regulated step in fatty acid synthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA  by biotin - and ATP-requiring acetyl CoA carboxylase  (ACC ). Citrate  \nallosterically activates ACC, and palmitoyl CoA  inhibits it. ACC  can also be activated by insulin  and inactivated by \nadenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase  (AMPK ) in response to epinephrine , glucagon , or a rise in AMP . \nThe remaining steps in fatty acid synthesis are catalyzed by the multifunctional enzyme, fatty acid synthase , which \nproduces palmitoyl CoA  by adding two-carbon units from malonyl CoA to a series of acyl acceptors. Fatty acids can \nbe elongated  and desaturated  in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum  (SER). When fatty acids are required for energy, \nhormone-sensitive lipase  (activated  by epinephrine , and inhibited  by insulin ), along with other lipases , degrades tria-\ncylglycerol  (TAG) stored in adipocytes . The fatty acid products are carried by serum albumin  to the liver and periph-\neral tissues, where their oxidation provides energy. The glycerol  backbone of the degraded TAG is carried by the blood \nto the liver, where it serves as a gluconeogenic precursor . Fatty acid degradation ( \u03b2-oxidation ) occurs in mitochon-\ndria. The carnitine shuttle  is required to transport long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. A \ntranslocase and the enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferases  (CPT) I and II are required. CPT-I  is inhibited by malonyl \nCoA, thereby preventing simultaneous synthesis and degradation of fatty acids. Mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation \nproduces acetyl CoA , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  (NADH ), and flavin adenine dinucleotide  (FADH 2). The first \nstep in \u03b2-oxidation is catalyzed by one of four acyl CoA dehydrogenases , each with chain-length specificity. Medium-\nchain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase  (MCAD ) deficiency  causes a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (process stops once \na medium-chain fatty acid is produced), resulting in hypoketonemia  and severe hypoglycemia . Oxidation of fatty acids \nwith an odd number  of carbons proceeds two carbons at a time (producing acetyl CoA) until three-carbon propionyl \nCoA remains. This compound is carboxylated to methylmalonyl CoA  (by biotin-  and ATP-requiring propionyl CoA \ncarboxylase ), which is then converted to succinyl CoA  (a gluconeogenic precursor) by vitamin B 12-requiring methyl-\nmalonyl CoA mutase . A genetic error in the mutase  or vitamin B 12 deficiency causes methylmalonic acidemia  and acid-\nuria. \u03b2-Oxidation of unsaturated  fatty acids requires additional enzymes. \u03b2-Oxidation of very-long-chain  fatty acids and \n\u03b1-oxidation of branched-chain  fatty acids occur in the peroxisome . Deficiencies result in X-linked adrenoleukodys-\ntrophy  and Refsum disease , respectively. \u03c9-Oxidation , normally a minor pathway, occurs in the SER. Liver mitochon-\ndria can convert acetyl CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation into acetoacetate  and 3-hydroxybutyrate  (ketone bodies ). \nPeripheral tissues possessing mitochondria can oxidize 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, which can be cleaved to two acetyl CoA, thereby producing energy for the cell. Unlike fatty acids, ketone bodies are utilized by the brain  and, there-\nfore, are important fuels during a fast. Because the liver lacks thiophorase  required to degrade ketone bodies, it synthe-\nsizes them specifically for the peripheral tissues. Ketoacidosis  occurs when the rate of ketone body formation is greater \nthan the rate of use, as is seen in cases of uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   317 24-10-2020   12:09:51"

Fatty acids are elongated in the \nsmooth endoplasmic reticulum by adding two carbons at a time to the carboxylate end (carbon 1) of the molecule.

The stored triacylglycerol was broken down for energy. However, acetyl CoA formed from breakdown of triacylglycerol could not enter the TCA cycle. The reason is that oxidation of ethanol and fatty acids generates a large amount of NADH. The high NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts all the oxaloacetate out of the TCA cycle to malate (see Chapter 14). The acetyl CoA therefore has to move to ketone synthesis as it cannot synthesize citrate in the absence of oxaloacetate.21.1. AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia \n(loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdom-inal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED).\n He was binge drinking last night and did not eat \nanything since yesterday. He has a 6-year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption.\n On examination, his liver was slightly enlarged. \nBedside tests revealed hypoglycemia and hyper-ketonemia. His fasting blood glucose was 58 mg/dl (normal reference 70\u2013100 mg/dl) and 3-hydroxy-butyrate was 50 mg/dl (normal reference range 0\u20133 mg/dl). His liver enzymes were raised by 3\u20135 times of normal.\nA.

The situation has also been such that the acetyl CoA so produced is unable to enter TCA cycle. \n(i)   Starvation will cause hypoglycemia (because of lack of \nfood intake) and ketonemia (because of excess acetyl CoA from breakdown of stored fats which cannot go to TCA cycle) (see Chapter 28).\n(ii)  Diabetes mellitus (see Chapter 29 for details).\nB.

A defect in the carnitine transporter \n(primary carnitine deficiency) would result in low levels of carnitine in the blood (as a result of increased urinary loss) and low levels in the tissues. In the liver, this decreases fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Consequently, blood levels of free fatty acids rise. Deficiencies of adipose triglyceride lipase  would decrease fatty acid availability. \nDeficiency of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I  would result \nin elevated blood carnitine. Defects in any of the enzymes of \u03b2-oxidation would result in secondary carnitine defi-\nciency, with a rise in acylcarnitines.21.2.

The teenager would be able to synthe-size all other compounds but, presumably, in somewhat decreased amounts.21.3.

Impaired oxidation of fatty acids \n<12 carbons in length results in decreased produc-tion of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), the allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase, a gluconeogenic enzyme, and, thus, glucose levels fall. Acetyl CoA can never be used for the net synthesis of glucose. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, and with medium-chain fatty acyl CoA dehydro-genase  deficiency, ketogenesis is decreased as a result \nof decreased production of the substrate, acetyl CoA. Impaired fatty acid oxidation means that less ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are made, and both are needed for gluconeogenesis.21.4. A 6-month-old boy was hospitalized following \na seizure. History revealed that for several days prior, his appetite was decreased owing to a stomach virus. At admission, his blood glucose was 24 mg/dl (age-referenced normal is 60\u2013100). His urine was negative for ketone bodies and positive for a variety of dicarboxylic acids. Blood carnitine levels (free and acyl bound) were normal. A tentative diagnosis of medium-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase  (MCAD) deficiency \nis made. In patients with MCAD deficiency, the fasting hypoglycemia is a consequence of:\nA. decreased acetyl coenzyme A production.\nB. decreased ability to convert acetyl coenzyme \nA to glucose.\nC. increased conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to \nacetoacetate.\nD. increased production of ATP and nicotinamide \nadenine dinucleotide.\nAnswer:  Zellweger syndrome is caused by an inability \nto target matrix proteins to the peroxisome. Therefore, all peroxisomal activities are affected because functional peroxisomes are unable to be formed. In X-linked adre-noleukodystrophy, the defect is an inability to transport VLCFA into the peroxisome, but other peroxisomal func-tions, such as \u03b1-oxidation, are normal.21.5.

PHOSPHOLIPID OVERVIEW\nPhospholipids are polar, ionic compounds composed of an alcohol that is \nattached by a phosphodiester bond to either diacylglycerol (DAG) or sphin-gosine. Like fatty acids (FA), phospholipids are amphipathic in nature. That is, each has a hydrophilic head, which is the phosphate group plus whatever alcohol is attached to it (for example, serine, ethanolamine, and choline; highlighted in blue in \nFig. 22.1A ), and a long, hydrophobic tail containing FA \nor FA-derived hydrocarbons (shown in orange in Fig. 22.1A ). Phospholipids \nare the predominant lipids of cell membranes. In membranes, the hydro-phobic portion of a phospholipid molecule is associated with the nonpolar portions of other membrane constituents, such as glycolipids, proteins, and cholesterol. The hydrophilic (polar) head of the phospholipid extends outward, interacting with the intracellular or extracellular aqueous environ-ment (see \nFig. 22.1A ). Membrane phospholipids also function as a reservoir \nfor intracellular messengers, and, for some proteins, phospholipids serve as anchors to cell membranes. Nonmembrane phospholipids serve addi-tional functions in the body, for example, as components of lung surfac-tant and essential components of bile, where their detergent properties aid cholesterol solubilization.\nII. PHOSPHOLIPID STRUCTURE\nThere are two classes of phospholipids: those that have glycerol (from glucose) as a backbone and those that have sphingosine (from serine and palmitate). Both classes are found as structural components of membranes, and both play a role in the generation of lipid signaling molecules.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe structure, metabolism and function of major phospholipids, \neicosanoids and sphingolipids\n\u2022 Describe therapeutic use of prostaglandins and inhibitors of eicosanoid \nsynthesis\n\u2022 Explain the genetic defects in sphingolipidosis\nFigure 22.1\nA.

Glycerophospholipids\nPhospholipids that contain glycerol are called glycerophospholipids (or \nphosphoglycerides). Glycerophospholipids constitute the major class of phospholipids and are the predominant lipids in membranes. All contain (or are derivatives of) phosphatidic acid (PA), which is DAG with a phos-phate group on carbon 3 (\nFig. 22.1B ). PA is the simplest phosphoglyc-\neride and is the precursor of the other members of this group.\n 1. From phosphatidic acid and an alcohol:  The phosphate group on \nPA can be esterified to a compound containing an alcohol group (see \nFig. 22.1 ). For example:\nSerine + PA \u2192 phosphatidylserine (PS)\nEthanolamine + PA \u2192 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)\nCholine + PA \u2192 phosphatidylcholine (PC) (lecithin)\nInositol + PA \u2192 phosphatidylinositol (PI)\nGlycerol + PA \u2192 phosphatidylglycerol (PG)\n 2. Cardiolipin:  Two molecules of PA esterified through their phos-\nphate groups to an additional molecule of glycerol form cardio-lipin, or diphosphatidylglycerol (\nFig. 22.2 ). Cardiolipin is found in \nmembranes in bacteria and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, cardiolipin is virtually exclusive to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it maintains the structure and function of certain respiratory complexes of the electron transport chain. [Note: Cardiolipin is antigenic and is recognized by antibodies (Ab) raised against Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The Wasserman test for syphilis detects these Ab.]\n 3. Plasmalogens:  When the FA at carbon 1 of a glycerophospho-\nlipid is replaced by an unsaturated alkyl group attached by an ether (rather than by an ester) linkage to the core glycerol molecule, an ether phosphoglyceride known as a plasmalogen is produced. For example, phosphatidalethanolamine, which is abundant in nerve tissue (\nFig. 22.3A ), is the plasmalogen that is similar in structure to \nphosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidalcholine (abundant in heart muscle) is the other quantitatively significant ether lipid in mammals. [Note: Plasmalogens have \u201cal\u201d rather than \u201cyl\u201d in their names.]\n 4. Platelet-activating factor:  A second example of an ether glycero-\nphospholipid is platelet-activating factor (PAF), which has a satu-rated alkyl group in an ether link to carbon 1 and an acetyl residue (rather than a FA) at carbon 2 of the glycerol backbone (\nFig. 22.3B ). \nPAF is synthesized and released by a variety of cell types. It binds to surface receptors, triggering potent thrombotic and acute inflam-matory events. For example, PAF activates inflammatory cells and mediates hypersensitivity, acute inflammatory, and anaphylactic reactions. It causes platelets to aggregate and activate and neutro-phils and alveolar macrophages to generate superoxide radicals to kill bacteria (see p. 255). It also lowers blood pressure. [Note: PAF is one of the most potent bioactive molecules known, causing effects at concentrations as low as 10\n\u221211 mol/l.]\nB.

The alcohol group at carbon 1 of sphingosine is esterified to phosphor-ylcholine, producing sphingomyelin, the only significant sphingophos-pholipid in humans. Sphingomyelin is an important constituent of the myelin sheath of nerve fibers. [Note: The myelin sheath is a layered, membranous structure that insulates and protects neuronal axons of the central nervous system (CNS).]\nIII. PHOSPHOLIPID SYNTHESIS\nGlycerophospholipid synthesis involves either the donation of PA from cyti-dine diphosphate (CDP)-DAG to an alcohol or the donation of the phos-phomonoester of the alcohol from CDP-alcohol to DAG (\nFig. 22.5 ). In \nboth cases, the CDP-bound structure is considered an activated interme-diate, and cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is released as a side product. Therefore, a key concept in glycerophospholipid synthesis is activation, of either DAG or the alcohol to be added, by linkage with CDP . [Note: This is similar in principle to the activation of sugars by their attachment to uridine diphosphate (UDP) (see p. 227).] The FA esterified to the glycerol alcohol groups can vary widely, contributing to the heterogeneity of this group of compounds, with saturated FA typically found at carbon 1 and unsaturated ones at carbon 2. Most phospholipids are synthesized in the smooth endo-plasmic reticulum (SER). From there, they are transported to the Golgi and then to membranes of organelles or the plasma membrane or are secreted from the cell by exocytosis. [Note: Ether lipid synthesis from dihydroxyac-etone phosphate begins in peroxisomes.]\nA. Phosphatidic acid\nPA is the precursor of other glycerophospholipids. The steps in its synthesis from glycerol 3-phosphate and two fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) molecules were illustrated in Figure 21.14, p. 189, in which PA is shown as a precursor of triacylglycerol (TAG).\nEssentially all cells except mature erythrocytes can synthe-\nsize phospholipids, whereas TAG synthesis occurs essentially only in the liver, adipose tissue, lactating mammary glands, and intestinal mucosal cells.\nB. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine\nThe neutral phospholipids PC and PE are the most abundant phos-\npholipids in most eukaryotic cells. The primary route of their synthesis uses choline and ethanolamine obtained either from the diet or from the turnover of the body\u2019s phospholipids. [Note: In the liver, PC also can be synthesized from PS and PE (see 2. below).]\n 1.

Significance of choline reutilization:  The reutilization of \ncholine is important because, although humans can synthesize choline de novo, the amount made is insufficient for our needs. Thus, choline is an essential dietary nutrient with an adequate intake (see p. 498) of 550 mg for men and 425 mg for women. [Note: Choline is also used for the synthesis of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.]\n b. Phosphatidylcholine in lung surfactant:  The pathway \ndescribed above is the principal pathway for the synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC or, dipalmitoyl lecithin). In DPPC, positions 1 and 2 on the glycerol are occupied by palmitate, a saturated LCFA. DPPC, made and secreted by type II pneumocytes, is a major lipid component of lung surfac-tant, which is the extracellular fluid layer lining the alveoli. Surfactant serves to decrease the surface tension of this fluid layer, reducing the pressure needed to reinflate alveoli, thereby preventing alveolar collapse (atelectasis). [Note: Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids (90%) and proteins (10%), with DPPC being the major component for reducing surface tension.]\nFetal lung maturity can be gauged by determining the DPPC/\nsphingomyelin ratio, usually written as L (for lecithin)/S, in amniotic fluid. A value \u22652 is evidence of maturity, because it reflects the shift from sphingomyelin to DPPC synthesis that occurs in pneumocytes at ~32 weeks\u2019 gestation.\n \n c. Lung maturity:  Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm \ninfants is associated with insufficient surfactant production and/or secretion and is a significant cause of all neonatal deaths in Western countries. Lung maturation can be accelerated by giving the mother glucocorticoids shortly before delivery to induce expression of specific genes. Postnatal administra-tion of natural or synthetic surfactant (by intratracheal instilla-tion) is also used. [Note: Acute RDS, seen in all age groups, is the result of alveolar damage (due to infection, injury, or aspira-tion) that causes fluid to accumulate in the alveoli, impeding the exchange of oxygen (O\n2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2).]\n 2. Phosphatidylcholine synthesis from phosphatidylserine:  The \nliver requires a mechanism for producing PC, even when free choline levels are low, because it exports significant amounts of PC in the bile and as a component of plasma lipoproteins. To provide the needed PC, PS is decarboxylated to PE by PS decarboxylase . \nPE then undergoes three methylation steps to produce PC, as illus-trated in \nFigure 22.6 . S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl group \ndonor (see p. 400).\nC. Phosphatidylserine\nPS synthesis in mammalian tissues is provided by the base exchange reaction, in which the ethanolamine of PE is exchanged for free serine (see \nFig. 22.6 ). This reaction, although reversible, is used primarily to \nproduce the PS required for membrane synthesis.

PI is an unusual phospholipid in that it most frequently \ncontains stearic acid on carbon 1 and arachidonic acid on carbon 2 of the glycerol. Therefore, PI serves as a reservoir of arachidonic acid in membranes and, thus, provides the substrate for prostaglandin (see p. 213) synthesis when required. Like PS, PI has a net negative charge. [Note: There is asymmetry in the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane. PS and PI, for example, are found primarily on the inner leaflet. Asymmetry is achieved by ATP-dependent enzymes known as \u201cflippases\u201d and \u201cfloppases.\u201d]\n 1.

For example, lipoprotein lipase , \nan enzyme that degrades triacylglycerol in lipoprotein particles (see p. 351), is attached to capillary endothelial cells by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. [Note: GPI-linked proteins are also found in a variety of parasitic protozoans, such as trypano-somes and leishmania.] Being attached to a membrane lipid (rather than being an integral part of the membrane) allows GPI-anchored proteins increased lateral mobility on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. The protein can be cleaved from its anchor by the action of phospholipase C  (see \nFig. 22.9 ). [Note: A defi-\nciency in the synthesis of GPI in hematopoietic cells results in the hemolytic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, because GPI-anchored proteins protect blood cells from complement-medi-ated lysis.]\nE. Phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin\nPhosphatidylglycerol occurs in relatively large amounts in mitochondrial membranes and is a precursor of cardiolipin (diphosphatidyglycerol). It is synthesized from CDP-DAG and glycerol 3-phosphate. Cardiolipin (see \nFig. 22.2 ) is synthesized by the transfer of DAG 3-phosphate from \nCDP-DAG to a pre-existing molecule of phosphatidylglycerol.\nF. Sphingomyelin\nSphingomyelin, a sphingosine-based phospholipid, is found in cell membranes and in the myelin sheath. The synthesis of sphingomyelin is shown in \nFigure 22.10 . Briefly, palmitoyl CoA condenses with serine, \nas CoA and the carboxyl group (as CO 2) of serine are lost. [Note: This \nreaction, like the decarboxylation reactions involved in the synthesis of PE from PS and of regulators from amino acids (for example, the cate-cholamines from tyrosine; see p. 423), requires pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of vitamin B\n6) as a coenzyme.] The product is reduced in a \nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-requiring reac-tion to sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine). The sphinganine is acylated at the amino group with one of a variety of LCFA and then desaturated to produce a ceramide, the immediate precursor of sphingomyelin (and other sphingolipids, as described on p. 327).\nCeramides play a key role in maintaining the skin\u2019s water-\npermeability barrier. Decreased ceramide levels are associ-ated with a number of skin diseases.\n \nPhosphorylcholine from PC is transferred to the ceramide, producing \nsphingomyelin and DAG. [Note: Sphingomyelin of the myelin sheath contains predominantly longer-chain FA such as lignoceric acid and nervonic acid, whereas gray matter of the brain has sphingomyelin that contains primarily stearic acid.]\nIV. PHOSPHOLIPID DEGRADATION\nThe degradation of phosphoglycerides is performed by phospholi-\npases  found in all tissues and pancreatic juice.

Phosphoglycerides\nPhospholipases hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of phosphoglyc-\nerides, with each enzyme cleaving the phospholipid at a specific site. The major phospholipases  are shown in \nFigure 22.11 . [Note: Removal \nof the FA from carbon 1 or 2 of a phosphoglyceride produces a lyso-phosphoglyceride, which is the substrate for lysophospholipases .] \nPhospholipases  release molecules that can serve as second messen-\ngers (for example, DAG and IP\n3) or that are the substrates for synthesis \nof messengers (for example, arachidonic acid). Phospholipases  are \nresponsible not only for degrading phospholipids but also for remod-eling them. For example, phospholipases A\n1 and A2 remove specific \nFA from membrane-bound phospholipids, which can be replaced with different FA using fatty acyl CoA transferase .

They also promote apoptosis.] Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B) is an autosomal-reces-sive disorder caused by the inability to degrade sphingomyelin due to a deficiency of sphingomyelinase , a type of phospholipase C . In the severe \ninfantile form (type A, which shows <1% of normal enzymic activity), the liver and spleen are the primary sites of lipid deposits and are, there-fore, greatly enlarged. The lipid consists primarily of the sphingomyelin that cannot be degraded (\nFig. 22.13 ). Infants with this lysosomal storage \ndisease experience rapid and progressive neurodegeneration as a result of deposition of sphingomyelin in the CNS, and they die in early child-hood. A less severe variant (type B, which shows up to 10% of normal activity) with a later age of onset and a longer survival time causes little to no damage to neural tissue, but lungs, spleen, liver, and bone marrow are affected, resulting in a chronic form of the disease. Although Niemann-Pick disease occurs in all ethnic groups, type A occurs with greater frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.\nV. GLYCOLIPID OVERVIEW\nGlycolipids are molecules that contain both carbohydrate and lipid compo-nents. Like the phospholipid sphingomyelin, glycolipids are derivatives of ceramides in which a LCFA is attached to the amino alcohol sphingosine. Therefore, they are more precisely called glycosphingolipids. [Note: Thus, ceramides are the precursors of both phosphorylated and glycosylated sphingolipids.] Like the phospholipids, glycosphingolipids are essential components of all membranes in the body, but they are found in greatest amounts in nerve tissue. They are located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where they interact with the extracellular environment. As such, they play a role in the regulation of cellular interactions (for example, adhe-sion and recognition), growth, and development.\nMembrane glycosphingolipids associate with cholesterol and \nGPI-anchored proteins to form lipid rafts, laterally mobile microdomains of the plasma membrane that function to orga-nize and regulate membrane signaling and trafficking functions.\n \nGlycosphingolipids are antigenic and are the source of ABO blood group \nantigens (see p. 272), various embryonic antigens specific for particular stages of fetal development, and some tumor antigens. [Note: The carbo-hydrate portion of a glycolipid is the antigenic determinant.] They have been coopted for use as cell surface receptors for cholera and tetanus toxins as well as for certain viruses and microbes. Genetic disorders associated with an inability to properly degrade the glycosphingolipids result in lyso-somal accumulation of these compounds. [Note: Changes in the carbohy-drate portion of glycosphingolipids (and glycoproteins) are characteristic of transformed cells (cells with dysregulated growth).]\nVI.

The number and type of carbohydrate moieties present \ndetermine the type of glycosphingolipid.\nA. Neutral glycosphingolipids\nThe simplest neutral glycosphingolipids are the cerebrosides. These are ceramide monosaccharides that contain either a molecule of galactose (forming ceramide-galactose or galactocerebroside, the most common cerebroside found in myelin, as shown in \nFig. 22.14 ) or glucose (forming \nceramide-glucose or glucocerebroside, an intermediate in the synthesis and degradation of the more complex glycosphingolipids). [Note: Members of a group of galacto- or glucocerebrosides may also differ from each other in the type of FA attached to the sphingosine.] As their name implies, cerebrosides are found predominantly in the brain and peripheral nerves, with high concentrations in the myelin sheath. Ceramide oligosaccharides (or globosides) are produced by attaching additional monosaccharides to a glucocerebroside, for example, ceramide-glucose-galactose (also known as lactosylceramide). The additional monosaccharides can include substituted sugars such as N-acetylgalactosamine.\nB. Acidic glycosphingolipids\nAcidic glycosphingolipids are negatively charged at physiologic pH. \nThe negative charge is provided by N-acetylneuraminic acid ([NANA], a sialic acid, as shown in \nFig. 22.15 ) in gangliosides or by sulfate groups \nin sulfatides.\n 1. Gangliosides:  These are the most complex glycosphingolipids \nand are found primarily in the ganglion cells of the CNS, particu-larly at the nerve endings. They are derivatives of ceramide oligo-saccharides and contain one or more molecules of NANA (from CMP-NANA). The notation for these compounds is G (for ganglio-side) plus a subscript M, D, T, or Q to indicate whether there is one (mono), two (di), three (tri), or four (quatro) molecules of NANA in the ganglioside, respectively. Additional numbers and letters in the subscript designate the monomeric sequence of the carbohydrate attached to the ceramide. (See \nFig. 22.15  for the structure of G M2.) \nGangliosides are of medical interest because several lipid storage disorders involve the accumulation of NANA-containing glycosphin-golipids in cells (see \nFig. 22.20 , p. 332).\n 2. Sulfatides:  These sulfoglycosphingolipids are sulfatedgalactocere-\nbrosides that are negatively charged at physiologic pH. Sulfatides are found predominantly in the brain and kidneys.\nVII.

Enzymes involved in synthesis\nThe enzymes involved in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids are glycos-\nyltransferases  that are specific for the type and location of the glycosidic \nbond formed. [Note: These enzymes can recognize both glycosphingo-lipids and glycoproteins as substrates.]\nB. Sulfate group addition\nA sulfate group from the sulfate carrier 3 \u2032-phosphoadenosine-5 \u2032-\nphosphosulfate ([PAPS], Fig. 22.16 ) is added by a sulfotransferase  to \nthe 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the galactose in a galactocerebroside, forming \nthe sulfatide galactocerebroside 3-sulfate ( Fig. 22.17 ). [Note: PAPS is \nalso the sulfur donor in glycosaminoglycan synthesis (see p. 269) and steroid hormone catabolism (see p. 364).] An overview of the synthesis of sphingolipids is shown in \nFigure 22.18 .\nC. Glycosphingolipid degradation\nGlycosphingolipids are internalized by phagocytosis as described for the glycosaminoglycans (see p. 269). All of the enzymes required for the degradative process are present in lysosomes, which fuse with the phagosomes. The lysosomal enzymes hydrolytically and irrevers-ibly cleave specific bonds in the glycosphingolipid. As seen with the glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins (see p. 275), degradation is a sequential process following the rule \u201clast on, first off,\u201d in which the last group added during synthesis is the first group removed in degradation. Therefore, defects in the degradation of the polysaccharide chains in these three glycoconjugates result in lysosomal storage diseases.\nD. Sphingolipidoses\nIn a normal individual, synthesis and degradation of glycosphingo-lipids are balanced, so that the amount of these compounds present in membranes is constant. If a specific lysosomal acid hydrolase  required \nfor degradation is partially or totally missing, a sphingolipid accumu-lates. Lysosomal lipid storage diseases caused by these deficiencies are called sphingolipidoses. The result of a specific acid hydrolase  defi-\nciency may be seen dramatically in nerve tissue, where neurologic dete-rioration can lead to early death. \nFigure 22.20  provides an outline of the Figure 22.17\nStructure of galactocerebroside 3-sulfate.

[Note: Some sphingolipidoses can also result from defects in lysosomal activator proteins (for example, the saposins) that facili-tate access of the hydrolases  to short carbohydrate chains as degra-\ndation proceeds.]\n 1. Common properties:  A specific lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme is \ndeficient in the classic form of each disorder. Therefore, usually, only a single sphingolipid (the substrate for the deficient enzyme) accu-mulates in the involved organs in each disease. [Note: The rate of biosynthesis of the accumulating lipid is normal.] The disorders are progressive and, although many are fatal in childhood, extensive phenotypic variability is seen leading to the designation of different clinical types, such as types A and B in Niemann-Pick disease. Genetic variability is also seen because a given disorder can be caused by any one of a variety of mutations within a single gene. The sphingolipidoses are autosomal-recessive disorders, except for Fabry disease, which is X linked. The incidence of the sphingolipi-doses is low in most populations, except for Gaucher and Tay-Sachs diseases, which, like Niemann-Pick disease, show a high frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. [Note: Tay-Sachs also has a high frequency in Irish American, French Canadian, and Louisiana Cajun populations.]\n 2. Diagnosis and treatment:  A specific sphingolipidosis can be \ndiagnosed by measuring enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts or peripheral leukocytes or by analyzing DNA (see Chapter 39). Histologic examination of the affected tissue is also useful. [Note: Shell-like inclusion bodies are seen in Tay-Sachs, and a crumpled tissue paper appearance of the cytosol is seen in Gaucher disease (\nFig. 22.19 ).] Prenatal diagnosis, using cultured amniocytes or chori-\nonic villi, is available. Gaucher disease, in which macrophages become engorged with glucocerebroside, and Fabry disease, in which globosides accumulate in the vascular endothelial lyso-somes of the brain, heart, kidneys, and skin, are treated by recom-binant human enzyme replacement therapy, but the monetary cost is extremely high. Gaucher has also been treated by bone marrow transplantation (because macrophages are derived from hema-topoietic stem cells) and by substrate reduction therapy through pharmacologic reduction of glucosylceramide, the substrate for the deficient enzyme.\nVIII.  EICOSANOIDS: PROSTAGLANDINS, \nTHROMBOXANES, AND LEUKOTRIENES\nProstaglandins (PG), thromboxanes (TX), and leukotrienes (LT) are collec-\ntively known as eicosanoids to reflect their origin from \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 poly-\nunsaturated FA with 20 carbons (eicosa = 20). They are extremely potent compounds that elicit a wide range of responses, both physiologic (inflam-matory response) and pathologic (hypersensitivity). They insure gastric integrity and renal function, regulate smooth muscle contraction (the intes-tine and uterus are key sites) and blood vessel diameter, and maintain platelet homeostasis. Although they have been compared to hormones in terms of their actions, eicosanoids differ from endocrine hormones in that they are produced in very small amounts in almost all tissues rather than \nThe crumpled tissue paper\nappearance of the cytoplasm of Gaucher cells is caused by enlarged, elongated lysosomesfilled with glucocerebroside.  \nFigure 22.19\nAspirated bone marrow cells from a \npatient with Gaucher disease.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   331 24-10-2020   12:10:01"

Eicosanoids are not stored, and they have an extremely short half-life, being rapidly metabolized to inactive products. Their biologic actions are mediated by plasma membrane GPCR (see p. 190), which are different in different organ systems and typically result in changes in cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Examples of eicosanoid structures are shown in \nFigure 22.21 .\nA. Prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis\nArachidonic acid, an \u03c9-6 FA containing 20 carbons and four double \nbonds (an eicosatetraenoic FA), is the immediate precursor of the predominant type of human PG (series 2 or those with two double bonds, as shown in \nFig. 22.22 ). It is derived by the elongation and desatura-\ntion of the essential FA linoleic acid, also an \u03c9-6 FA. Arachidonic acid \nis incorporated into membrane phospholipids (typically PI) at carbon 2, from which it is released by phospholipase A\n2 (Fig. 22.23 ) in response \nto a variety of signals, such as a rise in calcium. [Note: Series 1 PG contain one double bond and are derived from an \u03c9-6 eicosatrienoic \nFA, dihomo- \u03b3-linolenic acid, whereas series 3 PG contain three double \nbonds and are derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an \u03c9-3 FA. \nSee p. 503.]\n 1. Prostaglandin H2 synthase:  The first step in PG and TX synthesis \nis the oxidative cyclization of free arachidonic acid to yield PGH\n2 \nby PGH 2 synthase  (or, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ). This \nenzyme is an ER membrane-bound protein that has two catalytic activities: fatty acid cyclooxygenase  (COX ), which requires two \nmolecules of O\n2, and peroxidase , which requires reduced gluta-\nthione (see p. 253). PGH 2 is converted to a variety of PG and TX, as \nshown in Figure 22.23 , by cell-specific synthases . [Note: PG contain \na five-carbon ring, whereas TX contain a heterocyclic six-membered oxane ring (see \nFig. 22.21 ).] Two isozymes of PGH 2 synthase , usually \ndenoted as COX-1  and COX-2 , are known. COX-1  is made consti-\ntutively in most tissues and is required for maintenance of healthy gastric tissue, renal homeostasis, and platelet aggregation. COX-2  \nis inducible in a limited number of tissues in response to products of activated immune and inflammatory cells. [Note: The increase in PG synthesis subsequent to the induction of COX-2  mediates \nthe pain, heat, redness, and swelling of inflammation and the fever of infection.]\n 2. Synthesis inhibition:  The synthesis of PG and TX can be inhibited by \nunrelated compounds. For example, cortisol (a steroidal anti-inflam-matory agent) inhibits phospholipase A\n2 activity (see Fig. 22.23 ) and, \ntherefore, arachidonic acid, the substrate for PG and TX synthesis, is not released from membrane phospholipids. Aspirin, indometh-acin, and phenylbutazone (all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAID]) inhibit both COX-1  and COX-2  and, thus, prevent the \nsynthesis of the parent molecule, PGH\n2. [Note: Systemic inhibition \nof COX-1 , with subsequent damage to the stomach and the kidneys \nand impaired clotting of blood, is the basis of aspirin\u2019s toxicity.] Aspirin (but not other NSAID) also induces synthesis of lipoxins (anti-inflammatory mediators made from arachidonic acid) and resolvins and protectins (inflammation-resolving mediators made from EPA).

Thromboxanes and prostaglandins in platelet homeostasis\nThromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) is produced by COX-1  in activated plate-\nlets. It promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation and contraction of vascular smooth muscle, thereby promoting formation of blood clots (thrombi). Prostacyclin (PGI\n2), produced by COX-2  in vascular endothe-\nlial cells, inhibits platelet aggregation and stimulates vasodilation and, so, impedes thrombogenesis. The opposing effects of TXA\n2 and PGI 2 \nlimit thrombi formation to sites of vascular injury. [Note: Aspirin has an antithrombogenic effect. It inhibits TXA\n2 synthesis by COX-1  in plate-\nlets and PGI 2 synthesis by COX-2  in endothelial cells through irrevers-\nible acetylation of these isozymes ( Fig. 22.24 ). COX-1  inhibition cannot \nbe overcome in platelets, which lack nuclei. However, COX-2  inhibition \ncan be overcome in endothelial cells because they have a nucleus and, therefore, can generate more of the enzyme. This difference is the basis of low-dose aspirin therapy used to lower the risk of stroke and heart attacks by decreasing formation of thrombi.]\nC. Leukotriene synthesis\nArachidonic acid is converted to a variety of linear hydroperoxy (\u2013OOH) acids by a separate pathway involving a family of lipoxygen-\nases (LOX). For example, 5-LOX  converts arachidonic acid to 5-hydro-\nperoxy-6,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid ([5-HPETE]; see \nFig. 22.23 ). \n5-HPETE is converted to a series of LT containing four double bonds, the nature of the final products varying according to the tissue. LT are mediators of allergic response and inflammation. Inhibitors of 5-LOX  \nand LT-receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of asthma. [Note: LT synthesis is inhibited by cortisol and not by NSAID. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a response to LT overproduction with NSAID use in ~10% of individuals with asthma.]\nOHO\nCOO\u2013\nPGH2OPeroxidaseOOHO\nCOO\u2013\nPGG2OCyclooxygenase2 O2Desaturation\nElongation\nArachidonic acid\n20:4 (5,8,11,14)\n (an w-6 fatty acid)Dietary linoleic acid\n18:2 (9,12)\n(an w-6 fatty acid)\nCOO\u2013COO\u2013\n2 G-SH\nG-S-S-G\nFigure 22.22\nOxidation and cyclization of \narachidonic acid by the two catalytic activities ( cyclooxygenase  and \nperoxidase ) of PGH\n2 synthase  \n(prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ). \nG-SH = reduced glutathione; G-S-S-G = oxidized glutathione; PG = prostaglandin.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   334 24-10-2020   12:10:03"

Medical Perspectives\nNeonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)  is one of the most \ncommon cause of morbidity in preterm infants. The baby presents with apnea, cyanosis, inspiratory stridor and tachycardia. This is due to the inability of the immature lung to synthesize dipalmitoyl lecithin which is the main component of pulmonary surfactant.\nNeonatal RDS has to be differentiated from acute lung injury due to pulmo-\nnary inflammation (acute RDS ) and meconium aspiration syndrome  \n(aspiration of meconium in utero or during birth due to fetal distress). Neonatal hyaline membrane disease  is due to lining of alveoli with \nhyaline membrane leading to respiratory distress. This is also associated with surfactant deficiency and may also have an underlying genetic cause to it.\nIn pregnancies greater than 30 weeks, the lung maturity may be tested by \nlecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio . If L/S ratio is less than 2:1, the fetal \nlungs are likely to be surfactant deficient.\nThe presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnancies can lead to \nmiscarriage and preterm labor. They may be developed in patients with autoimmune diseases. The antibodies against membrane phospholipid cardiolipin leads to APL antibody syndrome.\nAnticardiolipin antibodies are found in systemic lupus erythematosus (see \nChapter 41, Medical Perspectives).\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  have anti-inflammatory \neffects and inhibit platelet aggregation, e.g., aspirin acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase by acetylation and ibuprofen acts by inhibiting cyclooxygenase  (COX)  by competing with arachidonate.\nProstaglandins and prostacyclins cause vasodilation and inhibit platelet \naggregation. PGF2 is used for medical termination of pregnancy and in inducing labor. PGE is a bronchodilator and is used in aerosols for relieving bronchospasm. PGE2 and PGD2 produce inflammation by increasing capillary permeability. This produces erythema and wheal at site of injury. Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretions and are therefore useful in treat-ment of acid peptic disease (see \nFig. 22.23 ).\nInhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis include aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbu-\ntazone and selective COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib (see Fig. 22.25 ).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   336 24-10-2020   12:10:04"

Chapter Summary\nPhospholipids  are polar, ionic compounds composed of an alcohol  (for example, choline  or ethanolamine ) attached \nby a phosphodiester bond either to diacylglycerol  (DAG ), producing phosphatidylcholine  or phosphatidylethanol-\namine , or to the amino alcohol sphingosine  (Fig. 22.25 ). Addition of a long-chain fatty acid to sphingosine produces a \nceramide . Addition of phosphorylcholine  produces the phospholipid sphingomyelin . Phospholipids are the predom-\ninant lipids of cell membranes . Nonmembrane phospholipids serve as components of lung surfactant  and bile. \nDipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine , also called dipalmitoyl lecithin , is the major lipid component of lung surfactant . \nInsufficient surfactant production causes respiratory distress syndrome . Phosphatidylinositol  (PI) serves as a reser-\nvoir for arachidonic acid  in membranes. The phosphorylation of membrane-bound PI produces phosphatidylino-\nsitol 4,5-bisphosphate  (PIP 2). This compound is degraded by phospholipase C  in response to the binding of various \nneurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors to membrane G protein\u2013coupled receptors . The products of this \ndegradation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate  (IP3) and DAG,  mediate the mobilization of intracellular calcium  and the acti-\nvation of protein kinase C , which act synergistically to evoke cellular responses. Specific proteins can be covalently \nattached via a carbohydrate bridge to membrane-bound PI, forming a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol  (GPI) anchor . A \ndeficiency in GPI synthesis in hematopoietic cells results in the hemolytic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin-\nuria. The degradation of phosphoglycerides is performed by phospholipases  found in all tissues and pancreatic juice. \nSphingomyelin  is degraded to a ceramide plus phosphorylcholine by the lysosomal enzyme sphingomyelinase , a defi-\nciency of which causes Niemann-Pick  (A and B ) disease . Glycosphingolipids  are derivatives of ceramides  to which \ncarbohydrates have been attached. Adding one sugar molecule to the ceramide produces a cerebroside , adding an \noligosaccharide produces a globoside , and adding an acidic N-acetylneuraminic acid  molecule produces a ganglio-\nside. Glycosphingolipids are found predominantly in cell membranes of the brain  and peripheral nervous tissue , with \nhigh concentrations in the myelin sheath . They are antigenic . Glycolipids are degraded in the lysosomes  by acid hydro-\nlases . A deficiency of any one of these enzymes causes a sphingolipidosis , in which a characteristic sphingolipid accu-\nmulates. Prostaglandins  (PG), thromboxanes  (TX), and leukotrienes  (LT), the eicosanoids , are produced in very small \namounts in almost all tissues, act locally, and have an extremely short half-life. They serve as mediators of the inflam-\nmatory response . Arachidonic acid  is the immediate precursor of the predominant class of human PG (those with two \ndouble bonds). It is derived by the elongation and desaturation of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid  and is stored in the \nmembrane as a component of a phospholipid, generally PI. Arachidonic acid is released from the phospholipid by phos-\npholipase A 2 (inhibited by cortisol ). Synthesis of the PG and TX begins with the oxidative cyclization of free arachidonic \nacid to yield PGH 2 by PGH 2 synthase  (or, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ), an endoplasmic reticular membrane \nprotein that has two catalytic activities: fatty acid cyclooxygenase  (COX ) and peroxidase . There are two isozymes of \nPGH 2 synthase : COX-1  (constitutive) and COX-2  (inducible). Aspirin  irreversibly inhibits both. Opposing effects of PGI 2 \nand TXA 2 limit clot formation. LT are linear molecules produced from arachidonic acid by the 5-lipoxygenase  (5-LOX ) \npathway. They mediate allergic response. Their synthesis is inhibited by cortisol and not by aspirin.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   337 24-10-2020   12:10:05"

A young primigravida gave birth to a baby at \n32 weeks of gestation in a remote Indian village. The baby was not having normal respiration because of which the parents got the child to the nearby healthcare center. The doctor on duty put the baby on oxygen and sent them to the city hospital immediately. At city hospital, a chest X-ray was done which showed pronounced hypoaera-tion and bilateral fine granular opacities in pulmo-nary parenchyma. The baby was given surfactant replacement therapy as well as put on ventilator. He survived the crisis and was discharged after a few weeks.\nA. What was the diagnosis?\nB. Why is it common in premature neonates?Answer\u2014B:  Respiratory distress syndrome is one of the \nmost common cause of morbidity in preterm infants. The baby presents with apnea, cyanosis, inspiratory stridor and tachycardia. This is due to inadequate synthesis of dipalmitoyl lecithin which is the main component of pulmo-nary surfactant. Surfactant reduces the surface tension in the alveoli by forming a thin layer film on the alveolar wall. It maintains the shape of the alveoli and prevents its collapse. Within the fetus, the surfactant is not required. However, at birth it must be present in adequate levels to prevent lung collapse. It starts getting synthesized at approximately 30 weeks of gestation. Hence premature births, as in this case, are prone to respiratory distress syndrome.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   339 24-10-2020   12:10:06"

OVERVIEW\nCholesterol, the characteristic steroid alcohol of animal tissues, performs \na number of essential functions in the body. For example, cholesterol is a structural component of all cell membranes, modulating their fluidity, and, in specialized tissues, cholesterol is a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. Cholesterol is also required for nerve conduc-tion and signal transduction. Therefore, it is critically important that the cells of the body be assured an appropriate supply of cholesterol. To meet this need, a complex series of transport, biosynthetic, and regula-tory mechanisms has evolved. The liver plays a central role in the regula-tion of the body\u2019s cholesterol homeostasis. For example, cholesterol enters the hepatic cholesterol pool from a number of sources including dietary cholesterol as well as that synthesized de novo by extrahepatic tissues and by the liver itself. Cholesterol is eliminated from the liver as unmodified cholesterol in the bile, or it can be converted to bile salts that are secreted into the intestinal lumen. It can also serve as a component of plasma lipo-proteins that carry lipids to the peripheral tissues. In humans, the balance between cholesterol influx and efflux is not precise, resulting in a gradual deposition of cholesterol in the tissues, particularly in the endothelial linings of blood vessels. This is a potentially life-threatening occurrence when the lipid deposition leads to plaque formation, causing the narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of cardio-, cerebro-, and peripheral vascular disease. \nFigure 23.1  summarizes the major sources of \nliver cholesterol and the routes by which cholesterol leaves the liver.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss cholesterol synthesis and degradation\n\u2022 Explain role of cholesterol in body\u2022 Describe the structure and functions of hormonal steroids\u2022 Explain regulation of lipoprotein metabolism and its associated disorders\u2022 Describe structure and function of lipoproteins and their relationship to \natherosclerosis\nFigure 23.1\nSources of liver cholesterol (influx) and \nroutes by which cholesterol leaves the liver (efflux).

            "Text": "II. Cholesterol Structure 343\nII. CHOLESTEROL STRUCTURE\nCholesterol is a very hydrophobic compound. It consists of four fused \nhydrocarbon rings (A\u2013D) called the steroid nucleus, and it has an eight-carbon, branched hydrocarbon chain attached to carbon 17 of the D ring. Ring A has a hydroxyl group at carbon 3, and ring B has a double bond between carbon 5 and carbon 6 (\nFig. 23.2 ).\nA. Sterols\nSteroids with 8 to 10 carbon atoms in the side chain at carbon 17 and a hydroxyl group at carbon 3 are classified as sterols. Cholesterol is the major sterol in animal tissues. It arises from de novo synthesis and absorption of dietary cholesterol. Intestinal uptake of cholesterol is mediated by the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein, the target of the drug ezetimibe that reduces absorption of dietary cholesterol (see p. 291). [Note: Plant sterols (phytosterols), such as \u03b2-sitosterol, are poorly \nabsorbed by humans (5% absorbed as compared to 40% for choles-terol). After entering the enterocytes, they are actively transported back into the intestinal lumen. Defects in the efflux transporter (ABCG5/8) result in the rare condition of sitosterolemia. Because some choles-terol is transported back as well, plant sterols reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Daily ingestion of plant sterol esters supplied, for example, in spreads, is one of a number of dietary strategies to reduce plasma cholesterol levels (see p. 503).]\nB. Cholesteryl esters\nMost plasma cholesterol is in an esterified form (with a fatty acid [FA] attached at carbon 3, as shown in \nFig. 23.2 ), which makes the structure \neven more hydrophobic than free (nonesterified) cholesterol. Cholesteryl esters are not found in membranes and are normally present only in low levels in most cells. Because of their hydrophobicity, cholesterol and its esters must be transported in association with protein as a component of a lipoprotein particle (see p. 350) or be solubilized by phospholipids and bile salts in the bile (see p. 349).\nIII. CHOLESTEROL SYNTHESIS\nCholesterol is synthesized by virtually all tissues in humans, although liver, intestine, adrenal cortex, and reproductive tissues, including ovaries, testes, and placenta, make the largest contributions to the cholesterol pool. As with FA, all the carbon atoms in cholesterol are provided by acetyl coen-zyme A (CoA), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) provides the reducing equivalents. The pathway is endergonic, being driven by hydrolysis of the high-energy thioester bond of acetyl CoA and the terminal phosphate bond of ATP . Synthesis requires enzymes in the cytosol, the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and the peroxi-some. The pathway is responsive to changes in cholesterol concentra-tion, and regulatory mechanisms exist to balance the rate of cholesterol synthesis against the rate of cholesterol excretion. An imbalance in this regulation can lead to an elevation in circulating levels of plasma choles-terol, with the potential for vascular disease.Hydrocarbon chain\nCholesterol\nCholesteryl ester HO21 2722 24\n20 23 25\n1218\n17\n13191\n2\n3\n4657814 1516 11\nABCD\nSteroid\nnucleus\nFatty\nacid10926\nOABCD\nCO\nFigure 23.2\nStructure of cholesterol and its ester.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   343 24-10-2020   12:10:07"

Cholesterol, Lipoprotein, and Steroid Metabolism\nA. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthesis\nThe first two reactions in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are similar \nto those in the pathway that produces ketone bodies (see Fig. 21.22, p. 313). They result in the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA ([HMG CoA], \nFig. 23.3 ). First, two acetyl CoA molecules condense \nto form acetoacetyl CoA. Next, a third molecule of acetyl CoA is added by HMG CoA synthase , producing HMG CoA, a six-carbon compound. \n[Note: Liver parenchymal cells contain two isoenzymes of the synthase . \nThe cytosolic enzyme participates in cholesterol synthesis, whereas the mitochondrial enzyme functions in the pathway for ketone body synthesis.]\nB. Mevalonate synthesis\nHMG CoA is reduced to mevalonate by HMG CoA reductase.  This is the \nrate-limiting and key regulated step in cholesterol synthesis. It occurs in the cytosol, uses two molecules of NADPH as the reducing agent, and releases CoA, making the reaction irreversible (\nFig. 23.4 ). [Note: \nHMG CoA reductase  is an integral membrane protein of the SER, with \nits catalytic domain projecting into the cytosol. Regulation of reductase  \nactivity is discussed in D. below.]\nC. Cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate\nThe reactions and enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate are illustrated in \nFigure 23.5 . [Note: The numbers shown in \nbrackets below correspond to numbered reactions shown in this figure.]\n1. Mevalonate is converted to 5-pyrophosphomevalonate in two steps, \neach of which transfers a phosphate group from ATP .\n2. A five-carbon isoprene unit, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), is \nformed by the decarboxylation of 5-pyrophosphomevalonate. The reaction requires ATP . [Note: IPP is the precursor of a family of mole-cules with diverse functions, the isoprenoids. Cholesterol is a sterol isoprenoid. Nonsterol isoprenoids include dolichol (see p. 274) and ubiquinone (or, coenzyme Q; see p. 165).]\n3. IPP is isomerized to 3,3-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DPP).4. IPP and DPP condense to form 10-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP).5. A second molecule of IPP then condenses with GPP to form \n15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). [Note: Covalent attach-ment of farnesyl to proteins, a process known as prenylation, is one mechanism for anchoring proteins (for example, ras) to the inner face of plasma membranes.]\n6. Two molecules of FPP combine, releasing pyrophosphate, and \nare reduced, forming the 30-carbon compound squalene. [Note: Squalene is formed from six isoprenoid units. Because 3 ATP are hydrolyzed per mevalonate residue converted to IPP , a total of 18 ATP are required to make the polyisoprenoid squalene.]\n7. Squalene is converted to the sterol lanosterol by a sequence of two \nreactions catalyzed by SER-associated enzymes that use molecular oxygen (O\n2) and NADPH. The hydroxylation of linear squalene trig-\ngers the cyclization of the structure to lanosterol.\n8. The conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol is a multistep process \ninvolving shortening of the side chain, oxidative removal of methyl groups, reduction of double bonds, and migration of a double bond.

Inactive SREBP-2 is an integral \nprotein of the SER membrane and associates with a second SER membrane protein, SREBP cleavage\u2013activating protein (SCAP). When sterol levels in the SER are low, the SREBP-2\u2013SCAP complex moves from the ER to the Golgi. In the Golgi membrane, SREBP-2 is sequentially acted upon by two proteases , which generate a \nsoluble fragment that enters the nucleus, binds the SRE, and func-tions as a transcription factor. This results in increased synthesis of HMG CoA reductase  and, therefore, increased cholesterol synthesis \n(\nFig. 23.6 ). However, if sterols are abundant, they bind SCAP at its \nsterol-sensing domain and induce the binding of SCAP to yet other ER membrane proteins, the insulin-induced gene proteins (INSIG). This results in the retention of the SCAP\u2013SREBP complex in the SER, thereby preventing the activation of SREBP-2 and leading to downregulation of cholesterol synthesis. [Note: SREBP-1c upregu-lates expression of enzymes involved in FA synthesis in response to insulin (see p. 301).]\n 2.

Drug inhibition:  The statin drugs (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovas-\ntatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) are structural analogs of HMG CoA and are (or are metabolized to) reversible, competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase  (\nFig. 23.7 ). They \nare used to decrease plasma cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nIV. CHOLESTEROL DEGRADATION\nHumans cannot metabolize the cholesterol ring structure to carbon dioxide and water. Rather, the intact steroid nucleus is eliminated from the body by conversion to bile acids and bile salts, a small percentage of which is excreted in the feces, and by secretion of cholesterol into the bile, which transports it to the intestine for elimination. [Note: Some of the choles-terol in the intestine is modified by bacteria before excretion. The primary compounds made are the isomers coprostanol and cholestanol, which are reduced derivatives of cholesterol. Together with cholesterol, these compounds make up the bulk of neutral fecal sterols.]\nV. BILE ACIDS AND BILE SALTS\nBile consists of a watery mixture of organic and inorganic compounds. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), or lecithin (see p. 322), and conjugated bile salts are quantitatively the most important organic components of bile. Bile can either pass directly from the liver, where it is synthesized, into the duodenum through the common bile duct, or be stored in the gallbladder when not immediately needed for digestion.\nA. Structure\nThe bile acids contain 24 carbons, with two or three hydroxyl groups and a side chain that terminates in a carboxyl group. The carboxyl group has a pK\na (see p. 80) of ~6. In the duodenum (pH ~6), this group \nwill be protonated in half of the molecules (the bile acids) and deprot-onated in the rest (the bile salts). The terms bile acid and bile salt are frequently used interchangeably, however. Both forms have hydroxyl groups that are \u03b1 in orientation (they lie below the plane of the rings) \nand methyl groups that are \u03b2 (they lie above the plane of the rings). \nTherefore, the molecules have both a polar and a nonpolar surface and can act as emulsifying agents in the intestine, helping prepare dietary fat (triacylglycerol [TAG]) and other complex lipids for degradation by pancreatic digestive enzymes.\nB. Synthesis\nBile acids are synthesized in the liver by a multistep, multiorganelle pathway in which hydroxyl groups are inserted at specific positions on the steroid structure; the double bond of the cholesterol B ring is reduced; and the hydrocarbon chain is shortened by three carbons, introducing a carboxyl group at the end of the chain. The most common resulting compounds, cholic acid (a triol) and chenodeoxycholic acid (a diol), as shown in \nFigure 23.8 , are called primary bile acids.

Cholesterol, Lipoprotein, and Steroid Metabolism\nThe rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis is the introduction of a \nhydroxyl group at carbon 7 of the steroid nucleus by 7-\u03b1-hydroxylase , a \nSER-associated cytochrome P450  monooxygenase  found only in liver. \nExpression of the enzyme is downregulated by bile acids ( Fig. 23.9 )].\nC. Conjugation\nBefore the bile acids leave the liver, they are conjugated to a mole-cule of either glycine or taurine (an end product of cysteine metabo-lism) by an amide bond between the carboxyl group of the bile acid and the amino group of the added compound. These new structures include glycocholic and glycochenodeoxycholic acids and taurocholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acids (\nFig. 23.10 ). The ratio of glycine to \ntaurine forms in the bile is ~3/1. Addition of glycine or taurine results in the presence of a carboxyl group with a lower pK\na (from glycine) or a \nsulfonate group (from taurine), both of which are fully ionized (negatively charged) at the alkaline pH of bile. The conjugated, ionized bile salts are more effective detergents than the unconjugated ones because of their enhanced amphipathic nature. Therefore, only the conjugated forms are found in the bile. Individuals with genetic deficiencies in the conver-sion of cholesterol to bile acids are treated with exogenously supplied chenodeoxycholic acid.\nBile salts provide the only significant mechanism for choles-\nterol excretion, both as a metabolic product of cholesterol and as a solubilizer of cholesterol in bile.\nD. Bacterial action on bile salts\nBacteria of the intestinal microbiota (see p. 514) can deconjugate \n(remove glycine and taurine) bile salts. They can also dehydroxylate carbon 7, producing secondary bile salts such as deoxycholic acid from cholic acid and lithocholic acid from chenodeoxycholic acid.\nE. Enterohepatic circulation\nBile salts secreted into the intestine are efficiently reabsorbed (>95%) and reused. The liver actively secretes bile salts via the bile salt export pump. In the intestine, they are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the apical sodium (Na\n+)\u2013bile salt cotransporter and returned to the blood \nvia a separate transport system. [Note: Lithocholic acid is only poorly absorbed.] They are efficiently taken up from blood by the hepatocytes via an isoform of the cotransporter and reused. [Note: Albumin binds bile salts and transports them through the blood as was seen with FA (see p. 298).] The continuous process of secretion of bile salts into the bile, their passage through the duodenum where some are decon-jugated then dehydroxylated to secondary bile salts, their uptake in the ileum, and their subsequent return to the liver as a mixture of primary and secondary forms is termed the enterohepatic circulation (\nFig. 23.11 ). Between 15 and 30 g of bile salts are secreted from the \nliver into the duodenum each day, yet only ~0.5 g (<3%) is lost daily in the feces. Approximately 0.5 g/day is synthesized from cholesterol in the liver to replace the amount lost. Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, bind bile salts in the gut and prevent their reabsorp-tion, thereby promoting their excretion. They are used in the treatment Figure 23.9\nSynthesis of the bile acids cholic \nacid and chenodeoxycholic acid from cholesterol.7-a-HydroxycholesterolHO OHCholesterolHO\nBile acidsCholesterol \n7-\u03b1-hydroxylaseO2\nNADPH + H+\nNADP+H2O\nCholic acid\n(a triol)Chenodeoxycholic acid\n(a diol)\nFigure 23.10\nConjugated bile salts.

[Note: Dietary fiber also binds bile salts and increases their excretion (see p. 506).]\nF. Bile salt deficiency: Cholelithiasis\nThe movement of cholesterol from the liver into the bile must be accompanied by the simultaneous secretion of phospholipid and bile salts. If this dual process is disrupted and more cholesterol is present than can be solubilized by the bile salts and PC present, the choles-terol may precipitate in the gallbladder, leading to cholesterol gallstone disease or cholelithiasis (\nFig. 23.12 ). This disorder is typically caused \nby a decrease of bile acids in the bile. Cholelithiasis also may result from increased secretion of cholesterol into bile, as seen with the use of fibrates (for example, gemfibrozil) to reduce cholesterol (and TAG) in the blood. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gall-bladder through a small incision) is currently the treatment of choice. However, for patients who are unable to undergo surgery, oral admin-istration of chenodeoxycholic acid to supplement the body\u2019s supply of bile acids results in a gradual (months to years) dissolution of the gall-stones. [Note: Cholesterol stones account for >85% of cases of chole-lithiasis, with bilirubin and mixed stones accounting for the rest].\nVI.

[Note: Because \nlipoprotein particles constantly interchange lipids and apolipoproteins, the actual apolipoprotein and lipid content of each class of particles is some-what variable.] Lipoproteins function both to keep their component lipids soluble as they transport them in the plasma and to provide an efficient mechanism for transporting their lipid contents to (and from) the tissues. In humans, the transport system is less perfect than in other animals and, as a result, humans experience a gradual deposition of lipid (especially choles-terol) in tissues.\nA. Composition\nLipoproteins are composed of a neutral lipid core (containing TAG and cholesteryl esters) surrounded by a shell of amphipathic apolipoproteins, phospholipid, and nonesterified (free) cholesterol (\nFig. 23.14 ). These \namphipathic compounds are oriented such that their polar portions are exposed on the surface of the lipoprotein, thereby rendering the particle soluble in aqueous solution. The TAG and cholesterol carried by the lipoproteins are obtained either from the diet (exogenous source) or from de novo synthesis (endogenous source). [Note: The cholesterol (C) content of plasma lipoproteins is now routinely measured in fasting blood. Total C = LDL-C + HDL-C + VLDL-C, where VLDL-C is calcu-lated by dividing TAG by 5 because the TAG/cholesterol ratio is 5/1 in VLDL. The goal value for total cholesterol is <200 mg/dl.]\n 1. Size and density:  Chylomicrons are the lipoprotein particles lowest \nin density and largest in size and that contain the highest percentage of lipid (as TAG) and the lowest percentage of protein. VLDL and LDL are successively denser, having higher ratios of protein to lipid. HDL particles are the smallest and densest.

Apolipoproteins:  The apolipoproteins associated with lipoprotein \nparticles have a number of diverse functions, such as providing recognition sites for cell-surface receptors and serving as activa-tors or coenzymes for enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism. Some of the apolipoproteins are required as essential structural components of the particles and cannot be removed (in fact, the particles cannot be produced without them), whereas others are transferred freely between lipoproteins. Apolipoproteins are divided by structure and function into several major classes, denoted by letters, with each class having subclasses (for example, apolipopro-tein [apo] C-I, apo C-II, and apo C-III). [Note: The functions of all the apolipoproteins are not yet known.]\nB. Chylomicron metabolism\nChylomicrons are assembled in intestinal mucosal cells and carry dietary (exogenous) TAG, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, and choles-teryl esters to the peripheral tissues (\nFig. 23.16 ). [Note: TAG account for \nclose to 90% of the lipids in a chylomicron.]\n 1. Apolipoprotein synthesis:  Apo B-48 is unique to chylomicrons. Its \nsynthesis begins on the rough ER (RER), and it is glycosylated as it moves through the RER and Golgi. [Note: Apo B-48 is so named because it constitutes the N-terminal 48% of the protein encoded by the gene for apo B. Apo B-100, which is synthesized by the liver and found in VLDL and LDL, represents the entire protein encoded by this gene. Posttranscriptional editing (see p. 665) of a cytosine to a uracil in intestinal apo B-100 messenger RNA (mRNA) creates a nonsense (stop) codon (see p. 635), allowing translation of only 48% of the mRNA.]\n 2. Chylomicron assembly:  Many enzymes involved in TAG, choles-\nterol, and phospholipid synthesis are located in the SER. Assembly of the apolipoprotein and lipid into chylomicrons requires micro-somal triglyceride transfer protein ([MTP], see p. 292), which loads apo B-48 with lipid. This occurs before transition from the ER to the Golgi, where the particles are packaged in secretory vesicles. These fuse with the plasma membrane releasing the lipoproteins, which then enter the lymphatic system and, ultimately, the blood. [Note: Chylomicrons leave the lymphatic system via the thoracic duct that empties into the left subclavian vein.]\n 3. Nascent chylomicron modification:  The particle released by the \nintestinal mucosal cell is called a nascent chylomicron because it is functionally incomplete. When it reaches the plasma, the particle is rapidly modified, receiving apo E (which is recognized by hepatic receptors) and apo C. The latter includes apo C-II, which is neces-sary for the activation of lipoprotein lipase  (LPL), the enzyme that \ndegrades the TAG contained in the chylomicron. The source of these apolipoproteins is circulating HDL (see \nFig. 23.16 ). [Note: Apo \nC-III on TAG-rich lipoproteins inhibits LPL.]\n 4. Triacylglycerol degradation by lipoprotein lipase:  LPL is an extra-\ncellular enzyme that is anchored to the capillary walls of most tissues but predominantly those of adipose tissue and cardiac and skel-etal muscle. The adult liver does not express this enzyme.

The FA are stored (in adipose) or used for energy (in muscle). The glycerol is taken up by the liver, converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (an intermediate of glycolysis), and used in lipid synthesis or gluconeogenesis. [Note: Patients with a deficiency of LPL or apo C-II (type I hyperlipoproteinemia or familial \nchylomicronemia) show a dramatic accumulation (\u22651,000 mg/dl) of chylomicron-TAG in the plasma (hypertriacylglycerolemia) even in the fasted state.

They must obtain apo C-II and apo E from circulating HDL (see \nFig. 23.17 ). \nAs with chylomicrons, apo C-II is required for activation of LPL. \n[Note: Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare hypolipoproteinemia caused by a defect in MTP , leading to an inability to load apo B with lipid. Consequently, few VLDL or chylomicrons are formed, and TAG accumulates in the liver and intestine. Absorption of fat-soluble vita-mins is decreased. LDL are low.]\n 2. Modification in the circulation:  As VLDL pass through the circu-\nlation, TAG is degraded by LPL, causing the VLDL to decrease in \nsize and become denser. Surface components, including the C and E apolipoproteins, are returned to HDL, but the particles retain apo B-100. Additionally, some TAG are transferred from VLDL to HDL in an exchange reaction that concomitantly transfers choles-teryl esters from HDL to VLDL. This exchange is accomplished by cholesteryl ester transfer protein  (CETP ), as shown in \nFigure 23.18 .\n 3. Conversion to low-density lipoproteins:  With these modifications, \nthe VLDL is converted in the plasma to LDL. Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) of varying sizes are formed during this transi-tion. IDL can also be taken up by liver cells through receptor-medi-ated endocytosis that uses apo E as the ligand. Apo E is normally present in three isoforms, E-2 (the least common), E-3 (the most common), and E-4. Apo E-2 binds poorly to receptors, and patients who are homozygotic for apo E-2 are deficient in the clearance of IDL and chylomicron remnants. These individuals have familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia (familial dysbetalipoproteinemia or broad beta disease), with hypercholesterolemia and premature atheroscle-rosis. [Note: The apo E-4 isoform confers increased susceptibility to an earlier age of onset of the late-onset form of Alzheimer disease. The effect is dose dependent, with homozygotes being at greatest risk.

Low-density lipoprotein metabolism\nLDL particles contain much less TAG than their VLDL predecessors \nand have a high concentration of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters (\nFig. 23.19 ). About 70% of plasma cholesterol is in LDL.\n 1. Receptor-mediated endocytosis:  The primary function of LDL parti-\ncles is to provide cholesterol to the peripheral tissues (or return it to the liver). They do so by binding to plasma membrane LDL receptors that recognize apo B-100 (but not apo B-48). Because these LDL receptors can also bind apo E, they are known as apo B-100/apo E receptors. A summary of the uptake and degradation of LDL particles is presented in Figure 23.20. [Note: The numbers in brackets below refer to corresponding numbers on that figure.] A similar mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis is used for the uptake and degra-dation of chylomicron remnants and IDL by the liver.\na. LDL receptors are negatively charged glycoproteins that are \nclustered in pits on cell membranes. The cytosolic side of the pit is coated with the protein clathrin, which stabilizes the pit.\nb. After binding, the LDL\u2013receptor complex is endocytosed. [Note: \nDefects in the synthesis of functional LDL receptors causes a significant elevation in plasma LDL-C. Patients with such defi-ciencies have type IIa hyperlipidemia (familial hypercholesterol-emia [FH]) and premature atherosclerosis. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia can also be caused by defects in apo B-100 that reduce its binding to the receptor and by increased activity of a protease , proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type \n9 (PCSK9 ), which promotes internalization and lysosomal degra-\ndation of the receptor. PCSK9  inhibitors are now available for \nthe treatment of hypercholesterolemia.]\nc. The vesicle containing LDL loses its clathrin coat and fuses with \nother similar vesicles, forming larger vesicles called endosomes.\nd. The pH of the endosome falls (due to the proton-pumping activity \nof endosomal ATPase ), which allows separation of the LDL from \nits receptor. The receptors then migrate to one side of the endo-some, whereas the LDL stay free within the lumen of the vesicle.\ne. The receptors can be recycled, whereas the lipoprotein remnants \nin the vesicle are transferred to lysosomes and degraded by lyso-somal acid hydrolases , releasing free cholesterol, amino acids, \nFA, and phospholipids. These compounds can be reutilized by the cell. [Note: Lysosomal storage diseases result from rare auto-somal-recessive deficiencies in the ability to hydrolyze lysosomal cholesteryl esters (Wolman disease) or to transport free choles-terol out of the lysosome (Niemann-Pick disease, type C).]\n 2. Endocytosed cholesterol and cholesterol homeostasis:  The \nchylomicron remnant\u2013, IDL-, and LDL-derived cholesterol affects cellular cholesterol content in several ways (see \nFig. 23.20 ). First, \nexpression of the gene for HMG CoA reductase  is inhibited by high \ncholesterol, and de novo cholesterol synthesis decreases as a result. Additionally, degradation of the reductase  is accelerated. Second, \nsynthesis of new LDL receptor protein is reduced by decreasing the expression of the LDL receptor gene, thus limiting further entry of LDL-C into cells.

Uptake by macrophage scavenger receptors:  In addition to \nthe highly specific and regulated receptor-mediated pathway for LDL uptake described above, macrophages possess high levels of scavenger receptor activity. These receptors, known as scav-enger receptor class A (SR-A), can bind a broad range of ligands and mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified LDL in which the lipid or apo B component has been oxidized. Unlike the LDL receptor, the scavenger receptor is not downregulated in response to increased intracellular cholesterol. Cholesteryl esters accumu-late in macrophages and cause their transformation into \u201cfoam\u201d cells, which participate in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque (\nFig. 23.22 ). LDL-C is the primary cause of atherosclerosis.\nE. High-density lipoprotein metabolism\nHDL comprise a heterogeneous family of lipoproteins with a complex metabolism that is not yet completely understood. HDL particles are formed in the blood by the addition of lipid to apo A-1, an apolipopro-tein made and secreted by the liver and intestine. Apo A-1 accounts for ~70% of the apolipoproteins in HDL. HDL perform a number of impor-tant functions, including the following.\n 1. Apolipoprotein supply:  HDL particles serve as a circulating reser-\nvoir of apo C-II (the apolipoprotein that is transferred to VLDL and chylomicrons and is an activator of LPL) and apo E (the apolipo-\nprotein required for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of IDL and chylomicron remnants).\n 2.

Cholesterol esterification:  The cholesterol taken up by HDL is \nimmediately esterified by the plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol \nacyltransferase  (LCAT , also known as PCAT , in which P stands for \nphosphatidylcholine, the source of the FA). This enzyme is synthe-sized and secreted by the liver. LCAT  binds to nascent HDL and \nis activated by apo A-I. LCAT  transfers the FA from carbon 2 of \nPC to cholesterol. This produces a hydrophobic cholesteryl ester, which is sequestered in the core of the HDL, and lysophosphati-dylcholine, which binds to albumin.

Hepatic lipase , which \ndegrades TAG and phospholipids, participates in the conversion of HDL2 to HDL3 (see \nFig. 23.23 ). CETP  (see p. 359) transfers some \nof the cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL in exchange for TAG, relieving product inhibition of LCAT . Because VLDL are catabolized \nto LDL, the cholesteryl esters transferred by CETP  are ultimately \ntaken up by the liver (see p. 359).\nABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein. ABC \nproteins use energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport mate-rials, including lipids, in and out of cells and across intracel-lular compartments. In addition to Tangier disease, defects in specific ABC proteins result in sitosterolemia, cystic fibrosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, respiratory distress syndrome due to decreased surfactant secretion, and liver disease due to decreased bile salt secretion.\n 4. Reverse cholesterol transport:  The selective transfer of choles-\nterol from peripheral cells to HDL and from HDL to the liver for bile acid synthesis or disposal via the bile is a key component of choles-terol homeostasis. This process of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is, in part, the basis for the inverse relationship seen between plasma HDL concentration and atherosclerosis and for the desig-nation of HDL as the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol carrier.

The efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells is mediated primarily by the transport protein ABCA1. [Note: Tangier disease is a very rare deficiency of ABCA1 and is characterized by the virtual absence of HDL particles due to degradation of lipid-poor apo A-1.] Cholesteryl ester uptake by the liver is mediated by the cell-surface receptor SR-B1 (scavenger receptor class B type 1) that binds HDL (see p. 357 for SR-A receptors). The HDL particle itself is not taken up. Instead, there is selective uptake of the cholesteryl ester from the HDL particle. [Note: Low HDL-C is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.]\nF. Lipoprotein (a) and heart disease\nLipoprotein (a), or Lp(a), is nearly identical in structure to an LDL particle. Its distinguishing feature is the presence of an additional apoli-poprotein molecule, apo(a), which is covalently linked at a single site to apo B-100. Circulating levels of Lp(a) are determined primarily by genetics. However, factors such as diet may play some role, as trans FA have been reported to increase it. The physiologic function of Lp(a) is unknown. When present in large quantities in the plasma, Lp(a) is asso-ciated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. [Note: Apo(a) is structurally homologous to plasminogen, the precursor of a blood protease  whose target is fibrin, the main protein component of blood \nclots. It is hypothesized that elevated Lp(a) slows the breakdown of blood clots that trigger heart attacks because it competes with plas-minogen for binding to fibrin.] Niacin reduces Lp(a), as well as LDL-C and TAG, and raises HDL-C.\nVII. STEROID HORMONES\nCholesterol is the precursor of all classes of steroid hormones: glucocorticoids (for example, cortisol), mineralocorticoids (for example, aldosterone), and the sex hormones (that is, androgens, estrogens, and progestins), as shown in \nFigure 23.24 . [Note: Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are collectively \ncalled corticosteroids.] Synthesis and secretion occur in the adrenal cortex (cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens), ovaries and placenta (estrogens and progestins), and testes (testosterone). Steroid hormones are transported by the blood from their sites of synthesis to their target organs. Because of their hydrophobicity, they must be complexed with a plasma protein. Albumin can act as a nonspecific carrier and does carry aldosterone. However, specific steroid-carrier plasma proteins bind the steroid hormones more tightly than does albumin (for example, corticosteroid-binding globulin, or transcortin, is responsible for transporting cortisol). A number of genetic diseases are caused by deficiencies in specific steps in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Some representative diseases are described in \nFigure 23.25 .\nA. Synthesis\nSynthesis involves shortening the hydrocarbon chain of cholesterol and hydroxylating the steroid nucleus.

NADPH and O 2 \nare required for the reaction. The cholesterol substrate can be newly synthesized, taken up from lipoproteins, or released by an esterase  from \ncholesteryl esters stored in the cytosol of steroidogenic tissues. The cholesterol moves to the outer mitochondrial membrane. An important control point is the subsequent movement from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process is mediated by StAR (steroido-genic acute regulatory) protein. Pregnenolone is the parent compound for all steroid hormones (see \nFig. 23.25 ). It is oxidized and then isom-\nerized to progesterone, which is further modified to the other steroid hormones by CYP protein\u2013catalyzed hydroxylation reactions in the SER and mitochondria. A defect in the activity or amount of an enzyme in this pathway can lead to a deficiency in the synthesis of hormones beyond the affected step and to an excess in the hormones or metabo-lites before that step. Because all members of the pathway have potent biologic activity, serious metabolic imbalances occur with enzyme defi-ciencies (see \nFig. 23.25 ). Collectively, these disorders are known as the \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH), because they result in enlarged adrenals. [Note: Addison disease, due to autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex, is characterized by adrenocortical insufficiency.]\nB. Adrenal cortical steroid hormones\nSteroid hormones are synthesized and secreted in response to hormonal signals. The corticoste-roids and androgens are made in different regions of the adrenal cortex and are secreted into blood in response to different signals. [Note: The adrenal medulla makes catecholamines (see p. 422).]\n 1. Cortisol:  Its production in the middle layer (zona \nfasciculata) of the adrenal cortex is controlled by the hypothalamus, to which the pituitary gland is attached (\nFig. 23.26 ). In response to severe \nstress (for example, infection), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), produced by the hypothalamus, travels through capillaries to the anterior lobe of the pituitary, where it induces the production and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a peptide. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete the glucocorticoid cortisol, the stress hormone. [Note: ACTH binds to a membrane G protein\u2013coupled receptor, resulting in cyclic AMP (cAMP) production and activation of protein kinase A  \n([PKA], see p. 190). PKA phosphorylates and \nactivates both the esterase  that converts choles-\nteryl ester to free cholesterol and StAR protein.] Cortisol allows the body to respond to stress through its effects on intermediary metabolism (for example, increased gluconeogenesis) and the inflammatory and immune responses (which \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   361 24-10-2020   12:10:18"

[Note: The reduction of cortisol in CAH results in a rise in ACTH that causes adrenal hyperplasia.]\n 2. Aldosterone:  Its production in the outer layer (zona glomerulosa) \nof the adrenal cortex is induced by a decrease in the plasma Na\n+/\npotassium (K+) ratio and by the hormone angiotensin II (Ang-II). \nAng-II (an octapeptide) is produced from angiotensin I ([Ang-I] a decapeptide) by angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE), an enzyme \nfound predominantly in the lungs but also distributed widely in the body. [Note: Ang-I is produced in the blood by cleavage of an inac-tive precursor, angiotensinogen, secreted by the liver. Cleavage is catalyzed by renin , made and secreted by the kidneys.] Ang-II binds \nto cell surface receptors. However, in contrast to ACTH, its effects are mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate pathway (see p. 325) and not by cAMP . Aldosterone\u2019s primary effect is on the kidney tubules, where it stimulates Na\n+ and water uptake \nand K+ excretion ( Fig. 23.27 ). [Note: An effect of aldosterone is an \nincrease in blood pressure. Competitive inhibitors of ACE are used \nto treat renin -dependent hypertension.]\n 3. Androgens:  Both the inner (zona reticularis) and middle layers of \nthe adrenal cortex produce androgens, primarily dehydroepiandros-terone and androstenedione. Although adrenal androgens themselves are weak, they are converted by aromatase  (CYP19 ) to testos-\nterone, a stronger androgen, in the testes and to estrogens in the ovaries (primarily) of premenopausal women. [Note: Postmenopausal women produce estrogen at extragonadal sites such as the breast. Aromatase  inhibitors are used in the treatment of estrogen-respon-\nsive breast cancer in these women.]\nC. Gonadal steroid hormones\nThe testes and ovaries (gonads) synthesize hormones necessary for sexual differentiation and reproduction. A single hypothalamic- releasing factor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, stimulates the ante-rior pituitary to release the glycoproteins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Like ACTH, LH and FSH bind to surface receptors and cause an increase in cAMP . LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone and the ovaries to produce estrogens and progesterone (see \nFig. 23.27 ). FSH regulates the growth of ovarian \nfollicles and stimulates testicular spermatogenesis.\nD. Mechanism\nEach steroid hormone diffuses across the plasma membrane of its target cell and binds to a specific cytosolic or nuclear receptor. These receptor\u2013ligand complexes accumulate in the nucleus, dimerize, and bind to specific regulatory DNA sequences (hormone response elements [HRE]) in association with coactivator proteins, thereby causing increased transcription of targeted genes (\nFig. 23.28 ). An \nHRE is found in the promoter or an enhancer element (see p. 623) for genes that respond to a specific steroid hormone, thus insuring coor-dinated regulation of these genes. Hormone\u2013receptor complexes can also inhibit transcription in association with corepressors.

Medical Perspectives\nLow-density lipoprotein is considered a \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol as it transports \ncholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. This is essential for various utilizations of cholesterol like formation of steroid hormones, bile acids and vitamin D. It gets its \u201cbad\u201d name from the fact that modified lipids (oxidized and glycated LDL) may deposit in blood vessel walls and lead to phago-cytosis by macrophages, foam cell formation, immune response, release of cytokines and metalloproteinases and ultimately rupture of atheroscle-rotic plaque and release of embolus to cause acute events like myocardial infarction or stroke. This happens because the ruptured thrombus lodges in an end artery supplying the myocardium or other vulnerable tissues leading to ischemia of the area that it was supplying.\nThe HDL is considered \u201cgood\u201d because it transfers cholesterol from the \nperipheral tissues to liver for degradation and elimination. Therefore, HDL is considered anti-atherogenic.\nA high LDL/HDL ratio as well as a high ApoB/ApoA ratio is considered to \nbe a risk factor for atherosclerosis.\nThe atherosclerotic plaque may be stable or unstable (vulnerable) and \nprone to rupture and send a thrombus into circulation. However, it is now clear that oxidative stress, like in smoking and glycation as in diabetes mellitus plus inflammation, has a major contributory role in vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaque.\nStatins  are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) \nreductase , and statins lower cholesterol by inhibiting HMG CoA reduc-\ntase. Cholestyramine  binds bile salts, hence facilitating their excretion. \nThis lowers the serum cholesterol. Ezetimibe selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption from small intestine.\nBile adequacy is important for cholesterol excretion. Low content of bile \nsalts and emulsifying phospholipids as well as increased cholesterol favor formation of gallstones in gallbladder.complex to interact through a zinc finger motif with the appropriate \nDNA sequence. Receptors for the steroid hormones, plus those for thyroid hormone, retinoic acid (see p. 534), and 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol (vitamin D; see p. 539), are members of a superfamily of struc-turally related gene regulators that function in a similar way.]\nE. Further metabolism\nSteroid hormones are generally converted into inactive metabolic excre-tion products in the liver. Reactions include reduction of unsaturated bonds and the introduction of additional hydroxyl groups. The resulting structures are made more soluble by conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulfate (from 3 \u2032-phosphoadenosyl-5 \u2032-phosphosulfate; see p. 269). \nThese conjugated metabolites are fairly water soluble and do not need protein carriers. They are eliminated in feces and urine.\n\u2022 Secretory phase of uterus and\n  mammary glands\n\u2022 Implantation and maturation of\n  fertilized ovumPROGESTERONE\u2022 Control menstrual cycle\n\u2022 Promote development of female\n  secondary sex characteristicsESTROGENS\u2022 Increases gluconeogenesis\n\u2022 Anti-inflammatory action\n\u2022 Protein breakdown in muscleCORTISOL\u2022 Stimulates renal reabsorption \n    of Na+ and excretion of K+ALDOSTERONEADRENAL CORTEX\nOVARIES\nTESTIS\n\u2022 Stimulates spermatogenesis\n\u2022 Promotes development of male\n   secondary sex characteristics\n\u2022 Promotes anabolism\n\u2022 Masculinization of the fetusTESTOSTERONE\nFigure 23.27\nActions of steroid hormones. \nNa+ = sodium; K+ = potassium.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   364 24-10-2020   12:10:21"

            "Text": "IX. Chapter Summary 365\nIX. Chapter Summary\nCholesterol  is a hydrophobic compound, with a single hydroxyl group \nlocated at carbon 3 of the A ring, to which a fatty acid (FA) can be attached, producing an even more hydrophobic cholesteryl ester . Cholesterol is \nsynthesized by virtually all human tissues, although primarily by the liver, \nintestine , adrenal cortex , and reproductive tissues  (\nFig. 23.29 ). All the \ncarbon atoms are provided by acetyl coenzyme A  (CoA), and nicotin-\namide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  provides the reducing equiv-\nalents. The pathway is driven by hydrolysis of the high-energy thioester bond of acetyl CoA and the terminal phosphate bond of ATP . Synthesis requires enzymes of the cytosol , smooth endoplasmic reticulum  (SER), \nand peroxisomes . The rate-limiting and regulated step in cholesterol \nsynthesis is catalyzed by the SER-membrane protein hydroxymethylgl-\nutaryl coenzyme A  (HMG CoA ) reductase , which produces mevalonate  \nfrom HMG CoA. The enzyme is regulated by a number of mechanisms: 1) increased expression  of the reductase  gene  when cholesterol levels \nare low, via the transcription factor, sterol regulatory element\u2013binding \nprotein-2  (SREBP-2 ), bound to a sterol regulatory element  (SRE), \nresulting in increased enzyme and, therefore, cholesterol, synthesis; 2) accelerated degradation  of the reductase  protein  when cholesterol levels \nare high; 3) phosphorylation  (causing inactivation  of reductase  activity) \nby adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase  [AMPK ] and \ndephosphorylation  (activation ) by a phosphoprotein phosphatase ; and \n4) hormonal regulation by insulin  and glucagon . Statins  are competi-\ntive inhibitors  of HMG CoA reductase . These drugs are used to decrease \nplasma cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia . The ring struc-\nture of cholesterol cannot be degraded in humans.\nCholesterol is eliminated from the body either by conversion to bile salts or \nby secretion into the bile. Bile salts  and phosphatidylcholine  (PC) are quan-\ntitatively the most important organic components of bile. The rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis is catalyzed by cholesterol-7-\n\u03b1-hydroxylase , \nwhich is inhibited by bile acids . Before the bile acids leave the liver, they are \nconjugated to a molecule of either glycine  or taurine , producing the conju-\ngated bile salts glycocholic  or taurocholic acid  and glycochenodeoxy-\ncholic  or taurochenodeoxycholic acid . Bile salts (deprotonated) are more \namphipathic than bile acids (protonated) and, therefore, are more effective emulsifiers  of dietary fat. Intestinal bacteria  can remove the glycine and \ntaurine as well as a hydroxyl group from the steroid nucleus, producing the secondary bile salts , deoxycholic  and lithocholic acids . Bile salts \nare efficiently reabsorbed (>95%) in the intestinal ileum by a sodium\u2013bile \nsalt cotransporter , returned to the blood, and carried by albumin  back \nto the liver where they are taken up by the hepatic isoform of the cotrans-porter and reused ( enterohepatic circulation,  which bile acid seques-\ntrants  reduce). If more cholesterol enters the bile than can be solubilized \nby the available bile salts and PC, cholesterol gallstone disease  (chole-\nlithiasis ) can occur.\nThe plasma lipoproteins (see \nFig. 23.29 ) include chylomicrons , very-low-\ndensity lipoproteins  (VLDL ), intermediate-density lipoproteins  (IDL), \nlow-density lipoproteins  (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins  (HDL). \nThey function to keep lipids (primarily triacylglycerol  [TAG] and choles-\nteryl esters ) soluble as they transport them between tissues. Lipoproteins \nare composed of a neutral lipid  (TAG, cholesteryl esters , or both) core \nsurrounded by a shell of amphipathic apolipoproteins , phospholipid , \nand nonesterified cholesterol .

They are released from the cells into the lymphatic \nsystem and travel to the blood, where they receive apo C-II  and apo E  from HDL. Apo C-II activates endothelial lipo-\nprotein lipase  (LPL), which degrades the TAG in chylomicrons to FA and glycerol. The FA that are released are stored (in \nadipose tissue ) or used for energy (in muscle ). The glycerol  is metabolized by the liver. Patients with a deficiency  of LPL \nor apo C-II show a dramatic accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma ( type I hyperlipoproteinemia  or familial chylo-\nmicronemia ) even if fasted. After most of the TAG is removed, apo C-II is returned to HDL, and the chylomicron remnant , \ncarrying most of the dietary cholesterol , binds to a liver receptor that recognizes apo E. The particle is endocytosed , \nand its contents degraded by lysosomal enzymes . Defective uptake of these remnants (and IDL) causes type III hyper-\nlipoproteinemia  or dysbetalipoproteinemia . Nascent VLDL are produced in the liver and are composed predominantly \nof TAG. They contain a single molecule of apo B-100 . Like chylomicrons, VLDL receive apo C-II and apo E from HDL in \nthe plasma. VLDL carry hepatic TAG to the peripheral tissues where LPL degrades the lipid. Additionally, the VLDL particle \nreceives cholesteryl esters  from HDL in exchange for TAG. This process is accomplished by cholesteryl ester transfer \nprotein  (CETP ). VLDL in the plasma is first converted to IDL and then to LDL, a much smaller, denser particle. Apo C-II \nand apo E are returned to HDL, but the LDL retains apo B-100, which is recognized by receptors on peripheral tissues and the liver. LDL undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis , and their contents are degraded in the lysosomes . The protease \nproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9 ) prevents receptor recycling. Defects in the synthesis of functional \nLDL receptors causes type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia  (familial hypercholesterolemia  [FH]). The endocytosed cholesterol \ndecreases expression of HMG CoA reductase  (and LDL receptors) through prevention of SREBP-2 binding to the SRE. \nSome of it can be esterified by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase  (ACAT ) and stored. HDL are created by lipidation  \nof apo A-1  synthesized in the liver and intestine. They have a number of functions, including 1) serving as a circulating \nreservoir  of apo C-II and apo E for chylomicrons and VLDL; 2) removing cholesterol  from peripheral tissues via ABCA1 \nand esterifying it using lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase  (\nLCAT ), a liver-synthesized plasma enzyme that is activated \nby apo A-1 ; and 3) delivering these cholesteryl esters to the liver ( reverse cholesterol transport ) for uptake via scav-\nenger receptor-B1  (SR-B1 ).\nCholesterol is the precursor of all classes of steroid hormones , which include glucocorticoids , mineralocorticoids , \nand the sex hormones  (androgens , estrogens , and progestins ). Synthesis, using primarily cytochrome P450 mixed \nfunction oxidases , occurs in the adrenal cortex  (cortisol  in the zona fasciculata , aldosterone  in the zona glomeru-\nlosa, and androgens  in the zona reticularis ), ovaries  and placenta  (estrogens  and progestins ), and testes  (testos-\nterone ). The initial and rate-limiting step is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone  by the side-chain cleavage \nenzyme P450 scc. Deficiencies in synthesis lead to congenital adrenal hyperplasia  (CAH ). Each steroid hormone diffuses \nacross the plasma membrane of its target cell and binds to a specific intracellular receptor. These receptor\u2013hormone \ncomplexes  accumulate in the nucleus, dimerize, and bind to specific regulatory DNA sequences ( hormone response \nelements ) in association with coactivator proteins, thereby causing increased transcription  of targeted genes. In asso-\nciation with corepressors, transcription is decreased.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   366 24-10-2020   12:10:22"

            "Text": "Study Questions 369\nCorrect answer = A.  The reductase is regulated by cova-\nlent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Depletion of ATP results in a rise in adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which activates AMP kinase (AMPK), thereby phosphor-ylating and inactivating the reductase. In the absence of the serine, a common phosphorylation site, the enzyme cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK. The enzyme is also regulated physiologically through changes in transcription and degradation and pharmacologically by statin drugs (competitive inhibitors), but none of these depends on serine phosphorylation.23.1. Mice were genetically engineered to contain \nhydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  in \nwhich serine 871, a phosphorylation site, was replaced by alanine.

The total cholesterol in the blood \nof a fasted individual is equal to the sum of the choles-terol in low-density lipoproteins plus the cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins plus the cholesterol in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). This last term is calculated by dividing the triacylglycerol value by 5 because cholesterol accounts for about 1/5 of the volume of VLDL in fasted blood.23.2. Calculate the amount of cholesterol in the low-\ndensity lipoproteins in an individual whose fasting blood gave the following lipid-panel test results: total cholesterol = 300 mg/dl, high-density lipo-protein cholesterol = 25 mg/dl, triglycerides = 150 mg/dl.\nA. 55 mg/dl\nB. 95 mg/dlC. 125 mg/dlD. 245 mg/dl\nCorrect answer = A.  The milky appearance of her plasma \nwas a result of triacylglycerol-rich chylomicrons.

Because aldosterone increases blood pressure, and cortisol increases blood glucose, their deficiencies result in a decrease in blood pressure and blood glucose, respectively. Cortisol normally feeds back to inhibit adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release by the pituitary, and, so, its absence results in an elevation in ACTH.

Statins are the first-line agents used to decrease cholesterol and reduce the risk of ASCVD events. The 2018 American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline recommends that low-density lipopro-tein cholesterol (LDL-C) should be measured and baseline LDL-C docu-mented for adults 20 years or older who are free from ASCVD (and not on lipid-lowering therapy).\nFor statin therapy, ASCVD risk, patient\u2019s age, comorbid conditions such as \ndiabetes and LDL-C levels are taken into account. There is no ideal target blood level for LDL-C. The 2018 AHA Guidelines recognize that \u201clower is better.\u201d Studies suggest that an optimal total cholesterol level is about 150 mg/dl, with LDL-C at or below 100 mg/dl. Lowering LDL-C levels by 1% generally equals about 1% reduction in heart disease and stroke risk.\nStatins can be used as different regimes (high, moderate or low intensity), \ndepending on percentage reduction in LDL-C levels. If a patient is unable to tolerate statins or statin alone is insufficient, other drugs such as bile acid sequestrants/ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor can be added\n.\nDRUGS USED FOR LOWERING LDL-C LEVELS\n\u2022 Statins : These drugs block intracellular cholesterol synthesis by inhib-\niting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase . As choles-\nterol level in hepatocytes is reduced, expression of the LDL receptor increases, which removes LDL from the circulation, thus reducing its entry into vessels and the formation of plaques. Examples include ator-vastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin.\n\u2022 Ezetimibe : This is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, which interacts with \ncholesterol transporters at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols. It helps in reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and a reduction of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and other triglycerides in the blood.\n\u2022 Bile acid sequestrants : These drugs work by sequestering cholesterol in \nthe gut so that it is not absorbed. The adverse effects include bloating and constipation and these drugs are poorly tolerated. Example includes cholestyramine.\n\u2022 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-like9 (PCSK9) inhibitors : PCSK9 \ninteracts with LDL receptor and enhances its degradation, causing higher circulating LDL concentrations. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 lower LDL levels and subsequently, cardiovascular risk.\n\u2022 Niacin : Niacin increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) \nand also significantly decreases concentrations of all apoB containing lipoproteins, i.e., very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]. Its adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, pruritus and flushing.\n\u2022 Fibrates : Fibric acid derivatives or fibrates decrease triglyceride levels. \nThey also reduce LDL-C levels and help to raise HDL-C. Fibrates act through a protein called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), which activates the enzyme lipoprotein lipase .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   372 24-10-2020   12:10:23"

As \nsuch, there is no storage form of amino acids (unlike carbohydrates which are stored as glycogen and fats which are stored as triacylglycerol). If ingested in excess, the amino acids are degraded into amino groups and carbon skeletons. The amino groups form urea (Chapter 24) and the carbon skeletons form many intermediate compounds as well as specialised products (Chapters 25 and 26).\n The amino groups of the amino acids are first channelized to glutamate (through transamination reaction) and then \ngiven into liver urea cycle to be made into urea. This urea, made in liver, is excreted out through the kidney. Therefore, liver disorders raise ammonia in blood (hyperammonemia because of non-detoxified amino groups), whereas kidney disorders raise blood urea because the kidney is unable to excrete the urea formed in liver (Chapter 24).\n The student will do well to differentiate urea (disposal form of amino groups from amino acids) from uric acid \n(degradation product of purine catabolism) as they have no relation to each other but often uremia is confused with hyperuricemia in the learning stages.\n The carbon skeleton of amino acids can be glucogenic or ketogenic and forms intermediaries of metabolism. Many \ngenetic defects of amino acid metabolism have been discovered and lead to rare diseases like phenylketonuria and alkaptonuria. Special products like tyrosine, catecholamine and serotonin are synthesized from amino acids (Chapter 25). Amino acids are also the precursors of many important nitrogen-containing compounds like hemeproteins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, cytochrome P450, etc.), neurotransmitters, hormones, purines and pyrimidines (Chapter 26).\n The primary healthcare physician often sees high blood urea in his patients which point towards kidney diseases or \nurinary tract obstruction. Detailed kidney function tests must be done for these patients (see Chapter 48: Organ function tests). Hyperammonemia symptoms are commonly seen in liver diseases like cirrhosis, often due to alcoholism. Liver function tests, ultrasound and CT scans will be required. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   376 24-10-2020   12:10:23"

OVERVIEW\nUnlike fats and carbohydrates, amino acids are not stored by the body. \nThat is, no protein exists whose sole function is to maintain a supply of amino acids for future use. Therefore, amino acids must be obtained from the diet, synthesized de novo, or produced from the degradation of body protein. Any amino acids in excess of the biosynthetic needs of the cell are rapidly degraded. The first phase of catabolism involves the removal of the \u03b1-amino groups (usually by transamination and subsequent oxida-\ntive deamination), forming ammonia and the corresponding \u03b1-keto acids, \nthe carbon skeletons of amino acids. A portion of the free ammonia is excreted in the urine, but most is used in the synthesis of urea (\nFig. 24.1 ), \nwhich is quantitatively the most important route for disposing of nitrogen from the body. In the second phase of amino acid catabolism, described in Chapter 25, the carbon skeletons of the \u03b1-keto acids are converted to \ncommon intermediates of energy-producing metabolic pathways. These compounds can be metabolized to carbon dioxide (CO\n2) and water (H 2O), \nglucose, fatty acids, or ketone bodies by the central pathways of metabo-lism described in Units III and IV.\nII.

Nitrogen leaves the body as urea, ammonia, \nand other products derived from amino acid metabolism (such as creati-nine, see p. 424). The role of body proteins in these transformations involves two important concepts: the amino acid pool and protein turnover.\nA. Amino acid pool\nFree amino acids are present throughout the body, such as in cells, blood, and the extracellular fluids. For the purpose of this discussion, envision all of these amino acids as if they belonged to a single entity, called the amino acid pool. This pool is supplied by three sources: 1) amino acids provided by the degradation of endogenous (body) proteins, most of which are reutilized; 2) amino acids derived from exogenous (dietary) protein; and 3) nonessential amino acids synthesized from simple inter-mediates of metabolism (\nFig. 24.2 ). Conversely, the amino acid pool \nis depleted by three routes: 1) synthesis of body protein, 2) consump-tion of amino acids as precursors of essential nitrogen-containing small molecules (specialized products), and 3) conversion of amino acids to glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, and ketone bodies or oxidation to CO\n2 + \nH2O (see Fig. 24.2 ). Although the amino acid pool is small (comprising \n~90\u2013100 g of amino acids) in comparison with the amount of protein in the body (~12 kg in a 70-kg man), it is conceptually at the center of whole-body nitrogen metabolism.\nIn healthy, well-fed individuals, the input to the amino acid \npool is balanced by the output. That is, the amount of amino acids contained in the pool is constant. The amino acid pool is said to be in a steady state, and the individual is said to be in nitrogen balance (see p. 509).\nB. Protein turnover\nMost proteins in the body are constantly being synthesized and \nthen degraded (turned over), permitting the removal of abnormal or unneeded proteins. For many proteins, regulation of synthesis deter-mines the concent ration of protein in the cell, with protein degradation \nassuming a minor role. For other proteins, the rate of synthesis is consti-tutive (that is, essentially constant), and cellular levels of the protein are controlled by selective degradation.\n 1. Rate:  In healthy adults, the total amount of protein in the body \nremains constant because the rate of protein synthesis is just suffi-cient to replace the protein that is degraded. This process, called protein turnover, leads to the hydrolysis and resynthesis of 300\u2013400 g of body protein each day. The rate of protein turnover varies widely for individual proteins. Short-lived proteins (for example, many regu-latory proteins and misfolded proteins) are rapidly degraded, having half-lives measured in minutes or hours. Long-lived proteins, with half-lives of days to weeks, constitute the majority of proteins in the \ncell. Structural proteins, such as collagen, are metabolically stable and have half-lives measured in months or years.\n 2. Protein degradation:  There are two major enzyme systems \nresponsible for degrading proteins: the ATP-dependent ubiquitin (Ub)\u2013proteasome system of the cytosol and the ATP-independent degradative enzyme system of the lysosomes. Proteasomes \nFigure 24.2 \nSources and fates of amino acids.

Lysosomes \nuse acid hydrolases  (see p. 269) to nonselectively degrade intracel-\nlular proteins (autophagy) and extracellular proteins (heterophagy), such as plasma proteins, that are taken into the cell by endocytosis. Liver cells can take up desialylated plasma proteins by asialoglyco-protein receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n a. Ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system:  Proteins selected for degra-\ndation by the cytosolic ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system are first modified by the covalent attachment of Ub, a small, globular, nonenzymic protein that is highly conserved across eukaryotic species. Ubiquitination of the target substrate occurs through isopeptide linkage of the \u03b1-carboxyl group of the C-terminal \nglycine of Ub to the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine in the protein \nsubstrate by a three-step, enzyme-catalyzed, ATP-dependent process. [Note: Enzyme 1  (E1, an activating enzyme) activates \nUb, which is then transferred to E2 (a conjugating enzyme). E3 \n(a ligase ) identifies the protein to be degraded and interacts with \nE2-Ub. There are many more E3 proteins than there are E1 or E2.] \nThe consecutive addition of four or more Ub molecules to the target protein generates a polyubiquitin chain. Proteins tagged with Ub chains are recognized by a large, barrel-shaped, macro-molecular, proteolytic complex called a proteasome (\nFig. 24.3 ). \nThe proteasome unfolds, deubiquitinates, and cuts the target protein into fragments that are then further degraded by cyto-solic proteases  to amino acids, which enter the amino acid pool. \nThe Ub is recycled. It is noteworthy that the selective degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin\u2013proteosome complex (unlike simple hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes) requires ATP hydrolysis.\n b. Degradation signals:  Because proteins have different half-\nlives, it is clear that protein degradation cannot be random but, rather, is influenced by some structural aspect of the protein that serves as a degradation signal, which is recognized and bound by an E3. The half-life of a protein is also influenced \nby the amino (N)-terminal residue, the so-called N-end rule, and ranges from minutes to hours. Destabilizing N-terminal amino acids include arginine and posttranslationally modified amino acids such as acetylated alanine. In contrast, serine is a stabilizing amino acid. Additionally, proteins rich in sequences containing proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (called PEST sequences after the one-letter designations for these amino acids) are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded and, there-fore, have short half-lives.\nIII. DIETARY PROTEIN DIGESTION\nMost of the nitrogen in the diet is consumed in the form of protein, typically amounting to 70\u2013100 g/day in the American diet (see \nFig. 24.2 ). Proteins \nare generally too large to be absorbed by the intestine. [Note: An example of an exception to this rule is that newborns can take up maternal anti-bodies in breast milk.] Therefore, proteins must be hydrolyzed to yield di- and tripeptides as well as individual amino acids, which can be absorbed. Proteolytic enzymes responsible for degrading proteins are produced by three different organs: the stomach, the pancreas, and the small intestine (\nFig. 24.4 ).Figure 24.3 \nThe ubiquitin\u2013proteasome degradation \npathway of proteins.

Digestion by gastric secretion\nThe digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, which secretes gastric \njuice, a unique solution containing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the proenzyme pepsinogen.\n 1. Hydrochloric acid:  Stomach HCl is too dilute (pH 2\u20133) to hydrolyze \nproteins. The acid, secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach, functions instead to kill some bacteria and to denature proteins, thereby making them more susceptible to subsequent hydrolysis by proteases .\n 2. Pepsin:  This acid-stable endopeptidase  is secreted by the chief \ncells of the stomach as an inactive zymogen (or proenzyme), pepsinogen. [Note: In general, zymogens contain extra amino acids in their sequences that prevent them from being catalytically active. Removal of these amino acids permits the proper folding required for an active enzyme.] In the presence of HCl, pepsinogen under-goes a conformational change that allows it to cleave itself (auto-catalysis) to the active form, pepsin , which releases polypeptides \nand a few free amino acids from dietary proteins and cuts a peptide bond that involves a tyrosine or a phenylalanine.\nB. Digestion by pancreatic enzymes\nOn entering the small intestine, the polypeptides produced in the stomach by the action of pepsin  are further cleaved to oligopeptides \nand amino acids by a group of pancreatic proteases  that include both \nendopeptidases  (that cleave within) and exopeptidases  (that cut at an \nend). [Note: Bicarbonate (HCO\n3\u2212), secreted by the pancreas in response \nto the intestinal hormone secretin, raises the intestinal pH.]\n 1. Specificity:  Each of these enzymes has a different specificity \nfor the amino acid R-groups adjacent to the susceptible peptide bond (\nFig. 24.5 ). For example, trypsin  cleaves only when the carbonyl \ngroup of the peptide bond is contributed by arginine or lysine. These enzymes, like pepsin  described above, are synthesized and secreted \nas inactive zymogens.Figure 24.4 \nDigestion of dietary proteins by the proteolytic enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract.Amino-\n  peptidases\nDi- and tri-\n  peptidases\nAmino acidsTrypsin\nChymotrypsinElastaseCarboxy-\n  peptidase\nOligopeptides\nand amino acidsPepsin\nPolypeptides\nand amino acids\nSMALL\nINTESTINEDietary protein\nTO LIVERSTOMACHSTOMACH\nPANCREASPANCREAS\nFigure 24.5 \nCleavage of dietary protein in the small intestine by pancreatic proteases .

Zymogen release:  The release and activation of the pancreatic \nzymogens are mediated by the secretion of cholecystokinin, a poly-peptide hormone of the small intestine (see p. 291).\n 3. Zymogen activation:  Enteropeptidase  (also called enterokinase ), a \nserine protease  synthesized by and present on the luminal (apical) \nsurface of intestinal mucosal cells (enterocytes) of the brush border, converts the pancreatic zymogen trypsinogen to trypsin  by removal \nof a hexapeptide from the N-terminus of trypsinogen. Trypsin  \nsubsequently converts other trypsinogen molecules to trypsin  by \ncleaving a limited number of specific peptide bonds in the zymogen. Thus, enteropeptidase  unleashes a cascade of proteolytic activity \nbecause trypsin  is the common activator of all the pancreatic zymo-\ngens (see \nFig. 24.5 ).\n 4. Digestion abnormalities:  In individuals with a deficiency in pancre-\natic secretion (for example, because of chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or surgical removal of the pancreas), the digestion and absorption of fat and protein are incomplete. This results in the abnormal appearance of lipids in the feces (a condition called steat-orrhea; see p. 292) as well as undigested protein.\nCeliac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of malabsorption \nresulting from immune-mediated damage to the small intes-tine in response to ingestion of gluten (or gliadin produced from gluten), a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\nC. Digestion of oligopeptides by small intestine enzymes\nThe luminal surface of the enterocytes contains aminopeptidase , an \nexopeptidase  that repeatedly cleaves the N-terminal residue from oligo-\npeptides to produce even smaller peptides and free amino acids.\nD. Amino acid and small peptide intestinal absorption\nMost free amino acids are taken into enterocytes via sodium-dependent secondary active transport by solute carrier (SLC) proteins of the apical membrane. At least seven different transport systems with overlapping amino acid specificities are known. Di- and tripeptides, however, are taken up by a proton-linked peptide transporter (PepT1). The peptides are then hydrolyzed to free amino acids. Regardless of their source, free amino acids are released from enterocytes into the portal system by sodium-independent transporters of the basolateral membrane. Therefore, only free amino acids are found in the portal vein after a meal containing protein. ORS fortified with amino acid (super ORS) enhances water and sodium uptake from intestine and rapidly corrects fluid-elec-trolyte imbalance in diarrhea. These amino acids are either metabolized \nby the liver or released into the general circulation. [Note: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are not metabolized by the liver but, instead, are sent from the liver to muscle via the blood.]\nE. Absorption abnormalities\nThe small intestine and the proximal tubules of the kidneys have common transport systems for amino acid uptake.

In the inherited disorder cystinuria, this carrier system is defec-tive, and all four amino acids appear in the urine (\nFig. 24.6 ). Cystinuria \noccurs at a frequency of 1 in 7,000 individuals, making it one of the most common inherited diseases and the most common genetic error of amino acid transport. The disease expresses itself clinically by the precipitation of cystine to form kidney stones (calculi), which can block the urinary tract. Oral hydration is an important part of treatment for this disorder. [Note: Defects in the uptake of tryptophan by a neutral amino acid transporter can result in Hartnup disorder and pellagra-like (see p. 532) dermatologic and neurologic symptoms as niacin is synthesized from tryptophan in our body.]\nIV. NITROGEN REMOVAL FROM AMINO ACIDS\nThe presence of the \u03b1-amino group keeps amino acids safely locked away \nfrom oxidative breakdown. Removing the \u03b1-amino group is essential for \nproducing energy from any amino acid and is an obligatory step in the catabolism of all amino acids. Once removed, this nitrogen can be incorpo-rated into other compounds or excreted as urea, with the carbon skeletons being metabolized. This section describes transamination and oxidative deamination, reactions that ultimately provide ammonia and aspartate, the two sources of urea nitrogen (see p. 386).\nA. Transamination: Funneling amino groups to glutamate\nThe first step in the catabolism of most amino acids is the transfer of their \u03b1-amino group to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\nFig. 24.7 ), producing an \u03b1-keto acid \n(derived from the original amino acid) and glutamate. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate \nplays a pivotal role in amino acid metabolism by accepting the amino groups from most amino acids, thereby becoming glutamate. Glutamate produced by transamination can be oxidatively deaminated (see B. below) or used as an amino group donor in the synthesis of nones-sential amino acids. This transfer of amino groups from one carbon skeleton to another is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called amino-\ntransferases  (also called transaminases ). These enzymes are found in \nthe cytosol and mitochondria of cells throughout the body. All amino acids, with the exception of lysine and threonine, participate in trans-amination at some point in their catabolism. [Note: These two amino acids lose their \u03b1-amino groups by deamination (see p. 401).]\n 1. Substrate specificity:  Each aminotransferase  is specific for one \nor, at most, a few amino group donors. Aminotransferases  are \nnamed after the specific amino group donor, because the acceptor of the amino group is almost always \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Two impor-\ntant aminotransferase  reactions are catalyzed by alanine amino-\ntransferase  (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase  (AST), as shown \nin \nFigure 24.8 .\n a. Alanine aminotransferase:  ALT is present in many tissues. The \nenzyme catalyzes the transfer of the amino group of alanine to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, resulting in the formation of pyruvate and \nglutamate. The reaction is readily reversible.

[Note: \nIn effect, glutamate acts as a collector of nitrogen from most amino acids.]\n b. Aspartate aminotransferase:  AST is an exception to the rule \nthat aminotransferases  funnel amino groups to form glutamate. \nDuring amino acid catabolism, AST primarily transfers amino \ngroups from glutamate to oxaloacetate, forming aspartate, which is used as a source of nitrogen in the urea cycle (see p. 385). Like other transaminations, the AST reaction is reversible.\n 2. Mechanism:  All aminotransferases  require the coenzyme pyridoxal \nphosphate (a derivative of vitamin B\n6; see p. 529), which is cova-\nlently linked to the \u03b5-amino group of a specific lysine residue at the \nactive site of the enzyme. Aminotransferases  act by transferring the \namino group of an amino acid to the pyridoxal part of the coenzyme to generate pyridoxamine phosphate. The pyridoxamine form of the coenzyme then reacts with an \u03b1-keto acid to form an amino acid, at \nthe same time regenerating the original aldehyde form of the coen-zyme. \nFigure 24.9  shows these two component reactions for the \ntransamination catalyzed by AST.\n 3. Equilibrium:  For most transamination reactions, the equilibrium \nconstant is near 1. This allows the reaction to function in both amino acid degradation through removal of \u03b1-amino groups (for example, \nafter consumption of a protein-rich meal) and biosynthesis of nones-sential amino acids through addition of amino groups to the carbon skeletons of \u03b1-keto acids (for example, when the supply of amino \nacids from the diet is not adequate to meet the synthetic needs of cells).\n 4. Diagnostic value:  Aminotransferases  are normally intracellular \nenzymes, with the low levels found in the plasma representing the release of cellular contents during normal cell turnover. Elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases  indicate damage to cells rich in \nthese enzymes. For example, physical trauma or a disease process can cause cell lysis, resulting in release of intracellular enzymes into the blood. Two aminotransferases , AST and ALT, are of particular \ndiagnostic value when they are found in the plasma.\n a. Hepatic disease:  Plasma AST and ALT are elevated in nearly \nall hepatic diseases but are particularly high in conditions that cause extensive cell necrosis, such as severe viral hepatitis, toxic injury, and prolonged circulatory collapse. ALT is more \nspecific than AST for liver disease, but the latter is more sensi-\ntive because the liver contains larger amounts of AST. Serial \nmeasurements of AST and ALT (liver function tests) are often \nuseful in determining the course of liver damage. \nFigure 24.10 \nshows the early release of ALT into the blood, following inges-\ntion of a liver toxin. [Note: The elevation in bilirubin results from hepatocellular damage that decreases the hepatic conjugation and excretion of bilirubin (see p. 420).]\n b. Nonhepatic disease:  Aminotransferases  may be elevated \nin nonhepatic diseases such as those that cause damage to cardiac or skeletal muscle. However, these disorders can usually be distinguished clinically from liver disease.Figure 24.8 \nReactions catalyzed during amino acid \ncatabolism. A. Alanine aminotransferase  \n(ALT). B.

Oxidative deamination: Amino group removal\nIn contrast to transamination reactions that transfer amino groups, \noxidative deamination reactions result in the liberation of the amino group as free ammonia (\nFig. 24.11 ). These reactions occur primarily in \nthe liver and kidney. They provide \u03b1-keto acids that can enter the central \npathways of energy metabolism and ammonia, which is a source of nitrogen in hepatic urea synthesis. [Note: Ammonia exists primarily as ammonium (NH\n4+) in aqueous solution, but it is the unionized form (NH 3) \nthat crosses membranes.]\n 1. Glutamate dehydrogenase:  As described above, the amino groups \nof most amino acids are ultimately funneled to glutamate by means of transamination with \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Glutamate is unique in that \nit is the only amino acid that undergoes rapid oxidative deami-nation, a reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase  ([GDH ], \nsee \nFig. 24.11 ). Therefore, the sequential action of transamination \n(resulting in the transfer of amino groups from most amino acids to \u03b1-ketoglutarate to produce glutamate) and the oxidative deam-\nination of that glutamate (regenerating \u03b1-ketoglutarate) provide a \npathway whereby the amino groups of most amino acids can be released as ammonia.\n a. Coenzymes:  GDH , a mitochondrial enzyme, is unusual in that \nit can use either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\n+) or \nits phosphorylated reduced form (NADPH) as a coenzyme (see \nFig. 24.11 ). NAD+ is used primarily in oxidative deamination (the \nsimultaneous loss of ammonia coupled with the oxidation of the carbon skeleton, as shown in \nFig. 24.12A ), whereas NADPH is \nused in reductive amination (the simultaneous gain of ammonia coupled with the reduction of the carbon skeleton, as shown in \nFig. 24.12B ).\n b. Reaction direction:  The direction of the reaction depends on \nthe relative concentrations of glutamate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and \nammonia and the ratio of oxidized to reduced coenzymes. For example, after ingestion of a meal containing protein, glutamate levels in the liver are elevated, and the reaction proceeds in the direction of amino acid degradation and the formation of ammonia (see \nFig. 24.12A ). High ammonia levels are required \nto drive the reaction to glutamate synthesis.\n c. Allosteric regulators:  Guanosine triphosphate is an allosteric \ninhibitor of GDH , whereas adenosine diphosphate is an acti-\nvator. Therefore, when energy levels are low in the cell, amino acid degradation by GDH  is high, facilitating energy production \nfrom the carbon skeletons derived from amino acids.\n 2. d-Amino acid oxidase:  \nD-Amino acids (see p. 80) are supplied by \nthe diet but are not used in the synthesis of mammalian proteins. They are, however, efficiently metabolized to \u03b1-keto acids, ammonia, \nand hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomes of liver and kidney cells by flavin adenine dinucleotide\u2013dependent \nD-amino acid oxidase  \n(DAO ). The \u03b1-keto acids can enter the general pathways of amino \nacid metabolism and be reaminated to L-isomers or catabolized for \nenergy. [Note: DAO  degrades D-serine, the isomeric form of serine \nthat modulates N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate \nreceptors.

DAO  also converts glycine to glyox-\nylate (see p. 398).] L-Amino acid oxidases  are found in snake venom \nand in liver and kidney peroxisomes in low concentrations.\nC. Ammonia transport to the liver\nTwo mechanisms are available in humans for the transport of ammonia from peripheral tissues to the liver for conversion to urea. Both are important in, but not exclusive to, skeletal muscle. The first uses gluta-\nmine synthetase  to combine ammonia with glutamate to form gluta-\nmine, a nontoxic transport form of ammonia (\nFig. 24.13 ). The glutamine \nis transported in the blood to the liver where it is cleaved by glutaminase  \nto glutamate and ammonia (see p. 389). The glutamate is oxidatively deaminated to ammonia and \u03b1-ketoglutarate by GDH . The ammonia \nis converted to urea. The second transport mechanism involves the formation of alanine by the transamination of pyruvate produced from both aerobic glycolysis and metabolism of the succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) generated by the catabolism of the BCAA isoleucine and valine. Alanine is transported in the blood to the liver, where it is transami-nated by ALT to pyruvate. The pyruvate is used to synthesize glucose, \nwhich can enter the blood and be used by muscle, a pathway called the glucose\u2013alanine cycle. The glutamate product of ALT can be deam-\ninated by GDH , generating ammonia. Thus, both alanine and glutamine \ncarry ammonia to the liver.\nV. UREA CYCLE\nUrea O\n(H2NCNH2) is the major disposal form of amino groups derived \nfrom amino acids and accounts for ~90% of the nitrogen-containing components of urine. One nitrogen of the urea molecule is supplied by free ammonia and the other nitrogen by aspartate. [Note: Glutamate is the immediate precursor of both ammonia (through oxidative deamination by GDH ) and aspartate nitrogen (through transamination of oxaloacetate by \nAST).] The carbon and oxygen of urea are derived from CO\n2 (as HCO 3\u2212). \nUrea is produced by the liver and then is transported in the blood to the kidneys for excretion in the urine.\nA. Reactions\nThe first two reactions leading to the synthesis of urea occur in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas the remaining cycle enzymes are located in the cytosol (\nFig. 24.14 ). [Note: Gluconeogenesis (see p. 216) and \nheme synthesis (see p. 416) also involve both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol.]\n 1. Carbamoyl phosphate formation:  Formation of carbamoyl phos-\nphate by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I)  is driven by \ncleavage of two molecules of ATP . Ammonia incorporated into carbamoyl phosphate is provided primarily by the oxidative deamina-tion of glutamate by mitochondrial GDH  (see \nFig. 24.11 ). Ultimately, \nthe nitrogen atom derived from this ammonia becomes one of the nitrogens of urea. CPS I  requires N-acetylglutamate (NAG) as a \npositive allosteric activator (see \nFig. 24.14 ). [Note: Carbamoyl phos-\nphate synthetase II  participates in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines \n(see p. 583).

The reaction product, citrulline, is transported to the cytosol. [Note: Ornithine and citrulline move across the inner mitochondrial membrane via an antiporter. These basic amino acids are not incorporated into \ncellular proteins because there are no codons for them (see p. 633).] Ornithine is regenerated with each turn of the urea cycle, much in the same way that oxaloacetate is regenerated by the reactions of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see p. 207).\n 3. Argininosuccinate formation:  Argininosuccinate synthetase  \ncombines citrulline with aspartate to form argininosuccinate. The \u03b1-amino group of aspartate provides the second nitrogen that is \nultimately incorporated into urea. The formation of argininosucci-nate is driven by the cleavage of ATP to adenosine monophos-phate and pyrophosphate. This is the third and final molecule of ATP consumed in the formation of urea. As it is converted to AMP , this consumption is equivalent to two molecules of ATP . So total consumption of ATP for one molecule of urea is four. Hence, detox-ification of ammonia is a costly affair energetically.\n 4. Argininosuccinate cleavage:  Argininosuccinate is cleaved by \nargininosuccinate lyase  to yield arginine and fumarate. The arginine \nserves as the immediate precursor of urea. The fumarate is hydrated to malate, providing a link with several metabolic pathways. Malate can be oxidized by malate dehydrogenase  to oxaloacetate, which \ncan be transaminated to aspartate (see \nFig. 24.8 ) and enter the urea \ncycle (see Fig. 24.14 ). Alternatively, malate can be transported into \nmitochondria via the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle (see p. 171), reenter the TCA cycle, and get oxidized to oxaloacetate, which can be used for gluconeogenesis (see p. 219). Thus, urea cycle is linked to TCA cycle and hence it is called urea bicycle or Krebs-Henseleit cycle. [Note: Malate oxidation generates NADH for oxidative phosphoryla-tion (see p. 67), thereby providing ATP for urea cycle.]\n 5. Arginine cleavage to ornithine and urea:  Arginase-I  hydrolyzes \narginine to ornithine and urea and is virtually exclusive to the liver. Therefore, only the liver can cleave arginine, thereby synthesizing urea, whereas other tissues, such as the kidney, can synthesize arginine from citrulline. [Note: Arginase-II  in kidneys controls argi-\nnine availability for nitric oxide synthesis (see p. 255).]\n 6. Fate of urea:  Urea diffuses from the liver and is transported in \nthe blood to the kidneys, where it is filtered and excreted in the urine (see \nFig. 24.19 ). A portion of the urea diffuses from the blood \ninto the intestine and is cleaved to CO 2 and ammonia by bacterial \nurease . The ammonia is partly lost in the feces and is partly reab-\nsorbed into the blood. It reaches liver via portal vein and regen-erates urea. In patients with kidney failure, plasma urea levels are elevated, promoting a greater transfer of urea from blood into the gut. The intestinal action of urease  on this urea becomes a clin-\nically important source of ammonia, contributing to the hyper-ammonemia often seen in these patients. Oral administration of antibiotics reduces the number of intestinal bacteria responsible for this ammonia production.\nFigure 24.13 \nTransport of ammonia (NH 3) from \nmuscle to the liver.

Overall stoichiometry\nAspartate + NH 3 + HCO 3 \u2013 + 3 ATP + H 2O \u2192\nurea + fumarate + 2 ADP + AMP + 2 P i + PP i\nBecause four high-energy phosphate bonds are consumed in the synthesis of each molecule of urea, the synthesis of urea is irreversible, with a large, negative \u0394G (see p. 160). One nitrogen of the urea mole-cule is supplied by free ammonia and the other nitrogen by aspartate. Glutamate is the immediate precursor of both ammonia (through oxida-tive deamination by GDH ) and aspartate nitrogen (through transami-\nnation of oxaloacetate by AST). In effect, both nitrogen atoms of urea \narise from glutamate, which, in turn, gathers nitrogen from other amino acids (\nFig. 24.15 ).\nC. Regulation\nNAG is an essential activator for CPS I , the rate-limiting step in the urea \ncycle. It increases the affinity of CPS I  for ATP . NAG is synthesized from \nacetyl CoA and glutamate by N-acetylglutamate synthase  (NAGS ), as \nshown in Figure 24.16 , in a reaction for which arginine is an activator. \nThe cycle is also regulated by substrate availability (short-term regula-tion) and enzyme induction (long term).\nVI. AMMONIA METABOLISM\nAmmonia is produced by all tissues during the metabolism of a variety of compounds, and it is disposed of primarily by formation of urea in the liver. However, the blood ammonia level must be kept very low, because even slightly elevated concentrations (hyperammonemia) are toxic to the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, a mechanism is required for the trans-port of nitrogen from the peripheral tissues to the liver for ultimate disposal as urea while keeping circulating levels of free ammonia low.\nA. Sources\nAmino acids are quantitatively the most important source of ammonia because most Western diets are high in protein and provide excess amino acids, which travel to the liver and undergo transdeamina-tion (that is, the linking of the aminotransferase  and GDH  reactions), \nproducing ammonia. [Note: The liver catabolizes straight-chain amino acids, primarily.] However, substantial amounts of ammonia can be obtained from other sources.\n 1. Glutamine:  An important source of plasma glutamine is from the \ncatabolism of BCAA in skeletal muscle. This glutamine is taken up by cells of the intestine, the liver, and the kidneys. The liver and kidneys generate ammonia from glutamine by the actions of gluta-\nminase  (\nFig. 24.17 ) and GDH . In the kidneys, most of this ammonia is \nexcreted into the urine as NH 4+, which provides an important mech-\nanism for maintaining the body\u2019s acid\u2013base balance through the excretion of protons. In the liver, the ammonia is detoxified to urea and excreted. [Note: \u03b1-Ketoglutarate, the second product of GDH , \nis a glucogenic precursor in the liver and kidneys.] Ammonia is also generated by intestinal glutaminase . Enterocytes obtain glutamine \neither from the blood or from digestion of dietary protein. [Note: Intestinal glutamine metabolism also produces alanine, which is Figure 24.15 \nFlow of nitrogen from amino acids to \nurea.

Intestinal bacteria:  Ammonia is formed from urea by the action \nof bacterial urease  in the lumen of the intestine. This ammonia is \nabsorbed from the intestine by way of the portal vein, and virtually all is removed by the liver via conversion to urea.\n 3. Amines:  Amines obtained from the diet and monoamines that \nserve as hormones or neurotransmitters give rise to ammonia by the action of monoamine oxidase  (see p. 423).\n 4. Purines and pyrimidines:  In the catabolism of purines and pyrim-\nidines, amino groups attached to the ring atoms are released as ammonia (see Fig. 34.15, p. 582).\nB. Transport in the circulation \nAlthough ammonia is constantly produced in the tissues, it is present at very low levels in blood. This is due both to the rapid removal of blood ammonia by the liver and to the fact that several tissues, partic-ularly muscle, release amino acid nitrogen in the form of glutamine and alanine, rather than as free ammonia (see \nFig. 24.13 ).\n 1.  Urea:  Formation of urea in the liver is quantitatively the most impor-\ntant disposal route for ammonia. Urea travels in the blood from the liver to the kidneys, where it passes into the glomerular filtrate.\n 2. Glutamine:  This amide of glutamate provides a nontoxic storage \nand transport form of ammonia (\nFig. 24.18 ). The ATP-requiring \nformation of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine \nsynthetase  occurs primarily in skeletal muscle and the liver but is \nalso important in the CNS, where it is the major mechanism for the removal of ammonia in the brain. Glutamine is found in plasma at concentrations higher than other amino acids, a finding consistent with its transport function. [Note: The liver keeps blood ammonia levels low through glutaminase , GDH , and the urea cycle in peri-\nportal (close to inflow of blood) hepatocytes and through glutamine \nsynthetase  as an ammonia scavenger in the perivenous hepato-\ncytes.] Ammonia metabolism is summarized in \nFigure 24.19 .\nC. Hyperammonemia\nThe capacity of the hepatic urea cycle exceeds the normal rates of ammonia generation, and the levels of blood ammonia are normally low (5\u201335 \u03bcmol/l). However, when liver function is compromised, due \neither to genetic defects of the urea cycle or liver disease, blood levels can be >1,000 \u03bcmol/l. Such hyperammonemia is a medical emergency, \nbecause ammonia has a direct neurotoxic effect on the CNS. For example, elevated concentrations of ammonia in the blood cause the symptoms of ammonia intoxication, which include tremors, slurring of speech, somnolence (drowsiness), vomiting, cerebral edema, and blur-ring of vision. At high concentrations, ammonia can cause coma and death. There are two major types of hyperammonemia.\n 1.

Chapter 48 on Organ Function Tests may be seen for further details. Radiologically, ultrasound, MRI and CT scan aid the diagnosis.\n 2. Congenital:  Genetic deficiencies of each of the five enzymes of \nthe urea cycle (and of NAGS ) have been described, with an overall \nincidence of ~1:25,000 live births. Since the urea cycle is central to the detoxification process, genetic defects of urea cycle will have severe neurological manifestations (high morbidity) and may not be compatible with life (high mortality)\n a. CPS I  defect:  It is a rare autosomal recessive condition (prev-\nalence 1 in 800,000 newborns in Japan) leading to hyperam-monemia. In first few days of life, features of hyperammonemia appears and may die soon. If the neonate survives, symptoms may recur on stress and infection. Treatment is low-protein diet. Treatment with benzoate and phenylacetate gives some bene-fits. As urea is not formed, excess nitrogen is accumulated in the form of glutamine and glycine. Activated phenylacetate, i.e., phenylacetyl CoA reacts with glutamine to form phenylacetylglu-tamine (\nFig. 24.20 ). Being water soluble, it is excreted in urine. \nSimilarly, benzyl CoA reacts with glycine to synthesize hippuric acid, that is also excreted in urine and thus body can dispose off some amount of nitrogen. Rarely, dialysis is also done.\n b. NAGS deficiency:  NAGS deficiency mimics hyperammonemia \ndue to CPS-I deficiency except that it responds to the treatment of NAG.\n c. Ornithine permease defect:  Ornithine is not transported to \nmitochondria from cytoplasm leading to hyperornithinemia and hyperammonemia. In absence of its normal substrate (ornithine), mitochondria act on lysine and carbamoylates to homocitrulline leading to homocitrullinuria. Treatment is similar to that of CPS I  \ndefect.\n d. X-linked OTC  deficiency:  It is the most common of these \ndisorders, predominantly affecting males, although female carriers may become symptomatic. Treatment is similar to that of CPS I  defect. All of the other urea cycle disorders follow \nan autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern. In each case, the failure to synthesize urea leads to hyperammonemia during the first weeks following birth.\n e. Arginosuccinate synthase deficiency:  Blood, CSF and urine \nlevel of citrulline is high. The treatment options do not differ much.\n f. Arginosuccinate lyase defect:  Blood, CSF and urine level of \narginosuccinate is high. The patients have low serum arginine, hepatomegaly, mental retardation and congenital trichorrhexis nodosa (friable and tufted hair). The treatment is complicated and out of scope of this book\n g.

This pres-\nents with edema, inability to gain height, swelling of hands and feet, and bulging of stomach. \nHyperammonemia is when blood ammonia concentration is greater than \nnormal. It is seen when ammonia is not converted to urea because of acquired diseases or genetic disorders. The acquired diseases are much more common and include alcoholism leading to damaged liver, fatty liver and liver cirrhosis. The acquired causes usually seen in adults also include drugs (hepatotoxins), overwhelming hepatitis B infections and chronic liver diseases. Hyperammonemia can cause brain injury and death. \nThe congenital reasons include defects in urea cycle and certain organic \nacidurias.\nInfants with urea cycle defects appear normal at birth but rapidly develop \nlethargy, seizures, neurological symptoms, cerebral edema and coma.\nOn the other hand, uremia (high blood urea) is a common abnormality seen \nin patients who are unable to excrete urea, mostly because of chronic renal disease (see Chapter 48: Organ Function Tests). Note that raised blood urea is not because of liver diseases. Liver diseases may cause hyperammonemia.\nVIII. Chapter Summary\nNitrogen enters  the body in a variety of compounds present in food, the most important being amino acids  contained \nin dietary protein . Nitrogen leaves  the body as urea , ammonia , and other products derived from amino acid metabo-\nlism ( Fig. 24.21 ). Free amino acids in the body are produced by hydrolysis of dietary protein by proteases  activated from \ntheir zymogen  form in the stomach and intestine, degradation of tissue proteins, and de novo synthesis. This amino \nacid pool  is consumed in the synthesis of body protein, metabolized for energy, or its members used as precursors \nfor other nitrogen-containing compounds. Free amino acids from digestion are taken up by intestinal enterocytes  via \nsodium-dependent secondary active transport . Small peptides are taken up via proton-linked transport . Note that \nbody protein is simultaneously degraded and resynthesized, a process known as protein turnover . The concentration of \na cellular protein may be determined by regulation of its synthesis or degradation. The ATP-dependent, cytosolic, selec-tive ubiquitin\u2013proteasome  and ATP-independent, relatively nonselective lysosomal acid hydrolases  are the two major \nenzyme systems that are responsible for degrading proteins . Nitrogen cannot be stored, and amino acids in excess of \nthe biosynthetic needs of the cell are quickly degraded. The first phase of catabolism  involves the transfer of the \u03b1-amino \ngroups through transamination  by pyridoxal phosphate \u2013dependent aminotransferases  (transaminases ), followed by \noxidative deamination of glutamate  by glutamate dehydrogenase , forming ammonia  and the corresponding  \u03b1-keto \nacids . A portion of the free ammonia  is excreted in the urine . Some ammonia is used in converting glutamate to gluta-\nmine  for safe transport, but most is used in the hepatic synthesis of urea , which is quantitatively the most important \nroute for disposing of nitrogen from the body. Alanine  also carries nitrogen to the liver for disposal as urea. The two major \ncauses of hyperammonemia  (with its neurologic effects) are acquired liver disease and congenital deficiencies of urea \ncycle enzymes such as X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   391 24-10-2020   12:10:33"

OVERVIEW\nGenetic information, stored in the chromosomes and transmitted to \ndaughter cells through DNA replication, is expressed through transcription \nto RNA and, in the case of messenger RNA (mRNA), subsequent translation \ninto proteins (polypeptides) as shown in Figure 37.1 . [Note: The proteome \nis the complete set of proteins expressed in a cell.] The process of protein \nsynthesis is called translation because the \u201clanguage\u201d of the nucleotide \nsequence on the mRNA is translated into the language of an amino acid \nsequence. Translation requires a genetic code, through which the infor-\nmation contained in the nucleotide sequence is expressed to produce a \nspecific amino acid sequence. Any alteration in the nucleotide sequence \nmay result in an incorrect amino acid being inserted into the protein, poten-\ntially causing disease or even death of the organism. Newly made immature \n(nascent) proteins undergo a number of processes to achieve their func-\ntional form. They must fold properly, and misfolding can result in aggrega-\ntion or degradation of the protein. Many proteins are covalently modified to \nalter their activities. Lastly, proteins are targeted to their final intra- or extra-\ncellular destinations by signals present in the proteins themselves.\nII. THE GENETIC CODE\nThe genetic code is a \u201cdictionary\u201d that identifies the correspondence \nbetween a sequence of nucleotide bases and a sequence of amino acids. \nEach individual \u201cword\u201d in the code is composed of three nucleotide bases. \nThese genetic words are called codons.Learning Objectives \nAt the end of this chapter, the student will be able to demonstrate an \nunderstanding of:\n\u2022 Genetic code\n\u2022 The process of protein synthesis \n\u2022 Mutations \n\u2022 Protein targeting \n\u2022 Posttranslational modifications\n5\u02b9 3\u02b9\nProteinmRNA\nN-terminus C-terminusProtein-coding regiontRNADNA\nrRNA28S5S\n5.8S\n18STRANSCRIPTION\nTRANSLATIONUTR UTR\nFigure 37.1\nProtein synthesis or translation. \ntRNA = transfer RNA; rRNA = ribosomal \nRNA; mRNA = messenger RNA; \nUTR = untranslated region.26Amino Acids: \nConversion to Specialized Products Including Porphyrins\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to serving as building blocks for proteins, amino acids are \nprecursors of many nitrogen-containing compounds that have important \nphysiologic functions ( Fig. 26.1 ). These molecules include porphyrins, \nneurotransmitters, hormones, purines, and pyrimidines. [Note: See p. 256 \nfor the synthesis of nitric oxide from arginine.]\nII. PORPHYRIN METABOLISM\nPorphyrins are cyclic compounds that readily bind metal ions, usually \nferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) iron. The most prevalent metalloporphyrin in \nhumans is heme, which consists of one Fe2+ coordinated in the center of \nthe tetrapyrrole ring of protoporphyrin IX (see p. 416). Heme is the prosthetic \ngroup for hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, the cytochromes, the cytochrome \nP450  (CYP) monooxygenase  system, catalase , nitric oxide synthase , and \nperoxidase . These hemeproteins are rapidly synthesized and degraded. For \nexample, 6\u20137 g of Hb is synthesized each day to replace heme lost through \nthe normal turnover of erythrocytes. The synthesis and degradation of the \nassociated porphyrins and recycling of the iron are coordinated with the \nturnover of hemeproteins.\nA. Structure\nPorphyrins are cyclic planar molecules formed by the linkage of four \npyrrole rings through methenyl bridges ( Fig. 26.2 ).

OVERVIEW\nAmino acid degradation involves removal of the \u03b1-amino group, followed \nby the catabolism of the resulting \u03b1-keto acids (carbon skeletons). These \npathways converge to form seven intermediate products: oxaloacetate, \npyruvate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate, succinyl coenzyme A (CoA), acetyl \nCoA, and acetoacetate. The products directly enter the pathways of inter-\nmediary metabolism, resulting either in the synthesis of glucose, ketone \nbodies, or lipids or in the production of energy through their oxidation to \ncarbon dioxide (CO 2) by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Figure 25.1 \nprovides an overview of these pathways, with a more detailed summary \npresented in Figure 25.15  (see p. 405). Nonessential amino acids ( Fig. 25.2 ) \ncan be synthesized in sufficient amounts from the intermediates of metabo-\nlism or, as in the case of cysteine and tyrosine, from essential amino acids. \nIn contrast, because the essential amino acids cannot be synthesized (or \nsynthesized in sufficient amounts) by humans, they must be obtained from \nthe diet in order for normal protein synthesis to occur. Genetic defects in the \npathways of amino acid metabolism can cause serious disease.\nII. GLUCOGENIC AND KETOGENIC AMINO ACIDS\nAmino acids can be classified as glucogenic, ketogenic, or both, based \non which of the seven intermediates are produced during their catabolism \n(see Fig. 25.2 ).Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids\n\u2022 Describe the metabolism of the carbon skeleton of amino acids\n\u2022 Discuss the biosynthesis of nonessential amino acids\n\u2022 Explain the genetic diseases of amino acids\nPYRUVATE\nCO2\nArg\nHis\nPro\nIle\nMet\nThr\nValAla\nCys\nGly\nSer\nThr\nTrp\nAsn\nAsp\nPhe\nTyrCitrate\nIsocitrate\na-KETOGLUTARATE\nSUCCINYL CoA SuccinateOXALOACETATE\nMalate\nFUMARATECO2\nCO2ACETYL CoAUDP-Glucose Galactose 1-PGlycogen Galactose\nUDP-Galactose Glucose 1-P Ribose 5-P\nGlucose 6-P Glucose \nFructose 6-P\nFructose 1,6-bis-P\nGlyceraldehyde 3-P\n1,3-bis-Phosphoglycerate\n3-Phosphoglycerate\n2-Phosphoglycerate\nPhosphoenolpyruvate\nPyruvate\nAcetyl CoAGlyceraldehyde 3-PGlyceraldehydeFructose\nFructose 1-P\nDihydroxyacetone-P\nGlycerol-P Glycerol\nTriacylglycerol\nFatty acyl CoA Fatty acid\nMalonyl CoA\nAcetoacetateCO2\n\u03b2-Hydroxybutyrate\nCitrate\nIsocitrate\n\u03b1-KetoglutarateGln\nGluArg\nHis\nPro\nMethylmalonyl CoA\nPropionyl CoA\nAcetyl CoA\nFatty acyl CoA\n(odd-number carbons)Succinyl CoA SuccinateAla\nCys\nGly\nSer\nThr\nTrpLactate\nMalate\nFumarateAsn\nCitrulline\nArgininosuccinate\nArginine\nPhe\nTyrNH3\nCarbamoyl-P\nOrnithine\nUreaXylulose 5-PRibulose 5-P6-P Gluconate\n6-P Gluconolactone\nErythrose 4-PSedoheptulose 7-P\nCO2\nCO2HCO3CO2\nGluGlnACETOACETATELeu\nLys\nPhe\nTrp\nTyrIleLeu\nLys\nPhe\nTrp\nTyr\nIle\nMet\nThr\nValOxaloacetate Aspartate\u2013\nFigure 25.1\nAmino acid metabolism shown as a \npart of the essential pathways of energy \nmetabolism.

A 68-year-old man presented to the medicine OPD \nwith complaint of progressive weakness, disorien-tation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and shallow respiration. The doctor after exam-ining him asked for routine blood tests. His Hb was 13 g/dl, blood urea 98 mg/dl, fasting glucose 100 mg/dl and blood assay showed metabolic acidosis. His liver function tests were normal.\nA. Discuss whether the blood urea and glucose \nare in normal range for this patient. Explain the expected disease.\nB. What other tests would you like to do for this \npatient?Answer\u2014A:  The patient is suffering from kidney disorder \nas his blood urea levels are high. Normal blood urea levels are 20\u201340 mg/dl. Normal fasting glucose is 70\u2013100 mg/dl. Urea is synthesized in the liver and excreted through the kidney.\nAnswer\u2014B: Further kidney function tests like creatinine \nand creatinine clearance tests must be done. High uremia usually signifies extreme damage to the kidney such that the kidneys are no longer able to filter the waste from the body.\nAnswer\u2014A: Hepatic encephalopathy is the probable \ndiagnosis. The signs of altered sensorium, tremors in hand and extreme drowsiness signify a deterioration in condi-tion of the chronic alcoholic patient such that the ammonia toxicity is now affecting the brain.\nAnswer\u2014B: Chronic alcoholism and liver cirrhosis lead to \na high ammonia level because liver is unable to detoxify ammonia to urea. The episode of gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hematemesis has further aggravated the condi-tion. Blood is high in protein and is reabsorbed from bowel adding to the protein and ammonia overload. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, and here it has caused hepatic encephalopathy which has the potential of leading to coma.24.2 A 50-year-old chronic alcoholic presented \nto the emergency department with a bout of hematemesis. He was already on treatment for cirrhosis and has severe jaundice and ascitis. But this time he had additional altered senso-rium, tremors in hand, very musty breath and was extremely drowsy. His blood ammonia levels were 140 \u03bcmol/l (normal reference range, 6\u201347 \u03bcmol/l).\nA. What is the probable diagnosis?\nB.

Pyruvate, aspartateCorrect answer = B.  Transamination reactions always \nhave an amino acid and an \u03b1-keto acid as substrates. The \nproducts of the reaction are also an amino acid (corre-sponding to the \u03b1-keto substrate) and an \u03b1-keto acid \n(corresponding to the amino acid substrate). Three amino acid \u03b1-keto acid pairs commonly encountered in metab-\nolism are alanine/pyruvate, aspartate/oxaloacetate, and glutamate/ \u03b1-ketoglutarate. In this question, glutamate is \ndeaminated to form \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate is \naminated to form aspartate.\nCorrect answer = D.  Glutamine, produced by the catab-\nolism of branched-chain amino acids in muscle, is deam-inated by glutaminase to ammonia + glutamate. The glutamate is deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase  to \nammonia + \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which can be used for gluco-\nneogenesis. Free amino acids are taken into enterocytes by several different sodium-linked transport systems. Healthy, well-fed individuals are in nitrogen balance, in which nitrogen input equals output. The liver converts ammonia to urea, and the kidneys use ammonia to buffer protons. Amino acid catabolism begins with transamina-tion that generates glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination. Toxic ammonia is transported as glutamine and alanine. Arginine is synthesized and hydro-lyzed in the hepatic urea cycle.24.2. Which one of the following statements about \namino acids and their metabolism is correct?\nA. Free amino acids are taken into the enterocytes \nby a single proton-linked transport system.\nB. In healthy, well-fed individuals, the input to the \namino acid pool exceeds the output.\nC. The liver uses ammonia to buffer protons.D. Muscle-derived glutamine is metabolized in \nliver and kidney tissue to ammonia + a gluco-neogenic precursor.\nE. The first step in the catabolism of most amino \nacids is their oxidative deamination.\nF . The toxic ammonia generated from the amide \nnitrogen of amino acids is transported through blood as arginine.Oxaloacetate\nGlutamateX\nYMultiple-Choice Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer. \nCorrect answer = C.  Genetic deficiencies of each of the \nfive enzymes of the urea cycle, as well as deficiencies in N-acetylglutamate synthase, have been described. The accumulation of citrulline (but not argininosuccinate) in the plasma of this patient means that the enzyme required for the conversion of citrulline to argininosuccinate (arginino-succinate synthetase) is defective, whereas the enzyme that cleaves argininosuccinate (argininosuccinate lyase) is functional.For Questions 24.3\u201324.5, use the following scenario.\nA female neonate appeared healthy until age ~24 hours, \nwhen she became lethargic. A sepsis workup proved negative. At 56 hours, she started showing focal seizure activity. The plasma ammonia level was found to be 887 \u03bcmol/l (normal 5\u201335 \u03bcmol/l). Quantitative plasma \namino acid levels revealed a marked elevation of citrul-line but not argininosuccinate.\n24.3.

Why might supplementation with arginine be of \nbenefit to this patient?Correct answer = B.  Deficiencies of the enzymes of \nthe urea cycle result in the failure to synthesize urea and lead to hyperammonemia in the first few weeks after birth. Glutamine will also be elevated because it acts as a nontoxic storage and transport form of ammonia. Therefore, elevated glutamine accompanies hyperammo-nemia.

Glucogenic amino acids\nAmino acids whose catabolism yields pyruvate or one of the intermedi-\nates of the TCA cycle are termed glucogenic.

Ketogenic amino acids\nAmino acids whose catabolism yields either acetoacetate or one of \nits precursors (acetyl CoA or acetoacetyl CoA) are termed ketogenic (see \nFig. 25.2 ). Acetoacetate is one of the ketone bodies, which also \ninclude 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetone (see p. 195). Leucine and lysine are the only exclusively ketogenic amino acids found in proteins. Their carbon skeletons are not substrates for gluconeogenesis and, there-fore, cannot give rise to the net synthesis of glucose.\nIII.  AMINO ACID CARBON SKELETON CATABOLISM\nThe pathways by which amino acids are catabolized are conveniently orga-\nnized according to which one (or more) of the seven intermediates listed above is produced from a particular amino acid.\nA. Amino acids that form oxaloacetate\nAsparagine is hydrolyzed by asparaginase , liberating ammonia and \naspartate ( Fig. 25.3 ). Aspartate loses its amino group by transamina-\ntion to form oxaloacetate (see Fig. 25.3 ). [Note: Some rapidly dividing \nleukemic cells are unable to synthesize sufficient asparagine to support their growth. This makes asparagine an essential amino acid for these cells, which, therefore, require asparagine from the blood. Asparaginase , \nwhich hydrolyzes asparagine to aspartate, can be administered system-ically to treat leukemia. Asparaginase  lowers the level of asparagine in \nthe plasma, thereby depriving cancer cells of a required nutrient.]\nB. Amino acids that form \u03b1-ketoglutarate via glutamate\n 1. Glutamine:  This amino acid is hydrolyzed to glutamate and ammonia \nby the enzyme glutaminase  (see p. 389). Glutamate is converted to \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate by transamination or through oxidative deamination \nby glutamate dehydrogenase  (see p. 385).\n 2. Proline:  This amino acid is oxidized to glutamate. Glutamate is \ntransaminated or oxidatively deaminated to form \u03b1-ketoglutarate.\n 3. Arginine:  This amino acid is hydrolyzed by arginase  to produce \nornithine (and urea). [Note: The reaction occurs primarily in the liver as part of the urea cycle (see p. 388).] Ornithine is subsequently converted to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, with glutamate semialdehyde as an \nintermediate.\u00a0Alanine\nArginineAsparagineAspartateCysteineGlutamateGlutamineGlycineProline SerineTyrosine\nHistidine\nMethionineThreonineValineLeucine\nLysineNonessential EssentialGlucogenic KetogenicGlucogenic\n     andKetogenic\nIsoleucine\nPhenyl-\n alanine\nTryptophan\nFigure 25.2\nClassification of amino acids.

Histidine:  This amino acid is oxidatively deaminated by histidase  \nto urocanic acid, which subsequently forms N-formiminoglutamate ([FIGlu], \nFig. 25.4 ). FIGlu donates its formimino group to tetrahy-\ndrofolate (THF), leaving glutamate, which is degraded as described above. [Note: Individuals deficient in folic acid excrete increased amounts of FIGlu in the urine, particularly after ingestion of a large dose of histidine. The FIGlu excretion test has been used in diag-nosing a deficiency of folic acid. See p. 402 for a discussion of folic acid, THF , and one-carbon metabolism.]\nC. Amino acids that form pyruvate\n 1. Alanine:  This amino acid loses its amino group by transamination \nto form pyruvate ( Fig. 25.5 ). [Note: Tryptophan catabolism produces \nalanine and, therefore, pyruvate (see Fig. 25.10 on p. 401).]\n 2. Serine:  This amino acid can be converted to glycine as THF \nbecomes N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (N5,N10-MTHF), as \nshown in Figure 25.6A. Serine can also be converted to pyruvate (see \nFig. 25.6B ).\n 3. Glycine:  This amino acid can be converted to serine by the reversible \naddition of a methylene group from N5,N10-MTHF (see Fig. 25.6A ) \nor oxidized to CO 2 and ammonia by the glycine cleavage system. \n[Note: Glycine can be deaminated to glyoxylate (by a d-amino acid \noxidase ; see p. 386), which can be oxidized to oxalate or trans-\naminated to glycine. Deficiency of the transaminase  in liver peroxi-\nsomes causes overproduction of oxalate, the formation of oxalate stones, and kidney damage (primary oxaluria type 1).]\n 4. Cysteine:  This sulfur-containing amino acid undergoes desulfur-\nization to yield pyruvate. [Note: The sulfate released can be used to synthesize 3 \u2032-phosphoadenosine-5 \u2032-phosphosulfate (PAPS), an \nactivated sulfate donor to a variety of acceptors.] Cysteine can also be oxidized to its disulfide derivative, cystine.\n 5. Threonine:  This amino acid is converted to pyruvate in most \norganisms but is a minor pathway (at best) in humans.\nD. Amino acids that form fumarate\n 1. Phenylalanine and tyrosine:  Hydroxylation of phenylalanine \nproduces tyrosine ( Fig. 25.7 ). This irreversible reaction, catalyzed by \ntetrahydrobiopterin-requiring phenylalanine hydroxylase  (PAH), initi-\nates the catabolism of phenylalanine.

Inherited deficiencies:  Inherited deficiencies in the enzymes of \nphenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism lead to the diseases phenyl-ketonuria (PKU) (see p. 404), tyrosinemia (see p. 274), and alkapton-uria (see p. 405) as well as the condition of albinism (see p. 408).\nE. Amino acids that form succinyl CoA: Methionine\nMethionine is one of four amino acids that form succinyl CoA. This sulfur-containing amino acid deserves special attention because it is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl group \ndonor in one-carbon metabolism (\nFig. 25.8 ). Methionine is also the \nsource of homocysteine (Hcy), a metabolite associated with atheroscle-rotic vascular disease and thrombosis (see p. 401).\n 1. S-Adenosylmethionine synthesis:  Methionine condenses with \nATP , forming SAM, a high-energy compound that is unusual in that it contains no phosphate. The formation of SAM is driven by hydro-lysis of all three phosphate bonds in ATP (see \nFig. 25.8 ).\n 2. Activated methyl group:  The methyl group attached to the sulfur \nin SAM is activated and can be transferred by methyltransferases  \nto a variety of acceptors such as norepinephrine in the synthesis of epinephrine. The methyl group is usually transferred to nitrogen or oxygen atoms (as with epinephrine synthesis and degradation, respectively; see p. 423) and sometimes to carbon atoms (as with cytosine). The reaction product, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), is \na simple thioether, analogous to methionine. The resulting loss of free energy makes methyl transfer essentially irreversible.\n 3. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolysis:  After donation of the methyl \ngroup, SAH is hydrolyzed to Hcy and adenosine. Hcy has two fates. If there is a deficiency of methionine, Hcy may be remethylated to methionine (see \nFig. 25.8 ). If methionine stores are adequate, Hcy \nmay enter the transsulfuration pathway, where it is converted to cysteine.\n a. Methionine resynthesis:  Hcy accepts a methyl group from \nN\n5-methyltetrahydrofolate (N5-methyl-THF) in a reaction requiring \nmethylcobalamin, a coenzyme derived from vitamin B 12 (see \np. 525). [Note: The methyl group is transferred by methionine \nsynthase  from the B 12 derivative to Hcy, regenerating methio-\nnine. Cobalamin is remethylated from N5-methyl-THF .]\n b. Cysteine synthesis:  Hcy condenses with serine, forming cysta-\nthionine, which is hydrolyzed to \u03b1-ketobutyrate and cysteine \n(see Fig. 25.8 ). This vitamin B 6\u2013requiring sequence has the net \neffect of converting serine to cysteine and Hcy to \u03b1-ketobutyrate, \nwhich is oxidatively decarboxylated to form propionyl CoA. Propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl CoA (see Fig. 21.20, \np. 312). Because Hcy is synthesized from the essential amino acid methionine, cysteine is not an essential amino acid as long as sufficient methionine is available.\n 4.

Mild elevations (hyperhomocysteinemia) are seen \nin ~7% of the population. Epidemiologic studies have shown that plasma Hcy levels are inversely related to plasma levels of folate, B\n12, and B 6, the three vitamins involved in the conversion of Hcy to \nmethionine and cysteine. Supplementation with these vitamins has been shown to reduce circulating levels of Hcy. However, in patients with established CVD, vitamin therapy does not decrease cardiovas-cular events or death. This raises the question as to whether Hcy is a cause of the vascular damage or merely a marker of such damage. [Note: Large elevations in plasma Hcy as a result of rare deficiencies in cystathionine \u03b2-synthase  of the transsulfuration pathway are seen \nin patients with classic homocystinuria (resulting from severe hyperho-mocysteinemia [>100 \u03bcmol/l], see p. 408).] Deficiencies in the remethyl-\nation reaction also result in a rise in Hcy.\nElevated homocysteine and decreased folic acid levels in \npregnant women are associated with increased incidence of neural tube defects (improper closure, as in spina bifida) in the fetus. Periconceptual supplementation with folate reduces the risk of such defects.\nF.

CoA = coenzyme A; PRPP = phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; NAD(H) = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. 1. Valine and isoleucine:  These amino acids are branched-chain \namino acids (BCAA) that generate propionyl CoA, which is converted to methylmalonyl CoA and then succinyl CoA by biotin- and vitamin B\n12\u2013requiring reactions.\n 2. Threonine:  This amino acid is dehydrated to \u03b1-ketobutyrate, which \nis converted to propionyl CoA and then to succinyl CoA. Propionyl CoA, then, is generated by the catabolism of the amino acids methi-onine, valine, isoleucine, and threonine. [Note: Propionyl CoA also is generated by the oxidation of odd-numbered fatty acids (see p. 311).]\nG. Amino acids that form acetyl CoA or acetoacetyl CoA\nTryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, and lysine form acetyl CoA or aceto-acetyl CoA directly, without pyruvate serving as an intermediate. As noted earlier, phenylalanine and tyrosine also give rise to acetoacetate during their catabolism (see\n Fig. 25.7 ). Therefore, there are a total of six \npartly or wholly ketogenic amino acids.\n 1. Tryptophan:  This amino acid is both glucogenic and keto-\ngenic, because its catabolism yields alanine and acetoacetyl CoA (\nFig. 25.10 ). [Note: Quinolinate from tryptophan catabolism is used \nin the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ([NAD], see p. 530).]\n 2. Leucine:  This amino acid is exclusively ketogenic, because its \ncatabolism yields acetyl CoA and acetoacetate (\nFig. 25.11 ). The \nfirst two reactions in the catabolism of leucine and the other BCAA, isoleucine and valine, are catalyzed by enzymes that use all three BCAA (or their derivatives) as substrates (see H. below).\n 3. Isoleucine:  This amino acid is both ketogenic and glucogenic, \nbecause its metabolism yields acetyl CoA and propionyl CoA.\n 4. Lysine:  This amino acid is exclusively ketogenic and is unusual \nin that neither of its amino groups undergoes transamination as the first step in catabolism. Lysine is ultimately converted to acetoacetyl CoA.\nH. Branched-chain amino acid degradation\nThe BCAA isoleucine, leucine, and valine are essential amino acids. In contrast to other amino acids, they are catabolized primarily by the peripheral tissues (particularly muscle), rather than by the liver. Because these three amino acids have a similar route of degradation, it is conve-nient to describe them as a group (see \nFig. 25.11 ).\n 1. Transamination:  Transfer of the amino groups of all three BCAA \nto \u03b1-ketoglutarate is catalyzed by a single, vitamin B 6\u2013requiring \nenzyme, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase , that is \nexpressed primarily in skeletal muscle.\n 2. Oxidative decarboxylation:  Removal of the carboxyl group of the \n\u03b1-keto acids derived from leucine, valine, and isoleucine is catalyzed \nby a single multienzyme complex, branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehy-\ndrogenase (BCKD) complex.  This complex uses thiamine pyrophos-\nphate, lipoic acid, oxidized flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), NAD+, \nand CoA as its coenzymes and produces NADH.

The dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase  (Enzyme 3 , or E3) compo-\nnent is identical in all three complexes.]\n 3. Dehydrogenations:  Oxidation of the products formed in the BCKD  \nreaction produces \u03b1-\u03b2-unsaturated acyl CoA derivatives and FADH 2. \nThese reactions are analogous to the FAD-linked dehydrogenation in the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids (see p. 309). [Note: Deficiency in the \ndehydrogenase  specific for isovaleryl CoA causes neurologic prob-\nlems and is associated with a \u201csweaty feet\u201d odor in body fluids.]\n 4. End products:  The catabolism of isoleucine ultimately yields acetyl \nCoA and succinyl CoA, rendering it both ketogenic and glucogenic. Valine yields succinyl CoA and is glucogenic. Leucine is ketogenic, being metabolized to acetoacetate and acetyl CoA. In addition, NADH and FADH\n2 are produced in the decarboxylation and dehy-\ndrogenation reactions, respectively. [Note: BCAA catabolism also results in glutamine and alanine being synthesized and sent out into the blood from muscle (see p. 386).]\nIV. FOLIC ACID AND AMINO ACID METABOLISM\nSome synthetic pathways require the addition of single-carbon groups that exist in a variety of oxidation states, including formyl, methenyl, meth-ylene, and methyl. These single-carbon groups can be transferred from carrier compounds such as THF and SAM to specific structures that are being synthesized or modified. The \u201cone-carbon pool\u201d refers to the single-carbon units attached to this group of carriers. [Note: CO\n2, coming from \nbicarbonate (HCO 3\u2013), is carried by the vitamin biotin (see p. 533), which \nis a prosthetic group for most carboxylation reactions but is not consid-ered a member of the one-carbon pool. Defects in the ability to add or remove biotin from carboxylases  result in multiple carboxylase  deficiency. \nTreatment is supplementation with biotin.]\nA. Folic acid and one-carbon metabolism\nThe active form of folic acid, THF , is produced from folate by dihy-\ndrofolate reductase  in a two-step reaction requiring two nicotinamide \nadenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The one-carbon unit carried by THF is bound to N\n5 or N10 or to both N5 and N10. Figure 25.12  shows \nthe structures of the various members of the THF family and their inter-conversions and indicates the sources of the one-carbon units and the synthetic reactions in which the specific members participate. [Note: Folate deficiency presents as a megaloblastic anemia because of decreased availability of the purines and of the thymidine monophos-phate needed for DNA synthesis (see p. 584).]\nV.  BIOSYNTHESIS OF NONESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS\nNonessential amino acids are synthesized from intermediates of metabo-\nlism or, as in the case of tyrosine and cysteine, from the essential amino acids phenylalanine and methionine, respectively.

Synthesis from \u03b1-keto acids\nAlanine, aspartate, and glutamate are synthesized by transfer of an amino \ngroup to the \u03b1-keto acids pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, \nrespectively. These transamination reactions ( Fig. 25.13 ; also see \np. 250) are the most direct of the biosynthetic pathways. Glutamate is unusual in that it can also be synthesized by reversal of oxidative deam-ination, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase , when ammonia levels \nare high (see p. 382).\nB. Synthesis by amidation\n 1. Glutamine:  This amino acid, which contains an amide linkage with \nammonia at the \u03b3-carboxyl, is formed from glutamate by glutamine \nsynthetase  (see Fig. 24.18, p. 389). The reaction is driven by the \nhydrolysis of ATP . In addition to producing glutamine for protein synthesis, the reaction also serves as a major mechanism for the transport of ammonia in a nontoxic form. (See p. 388 for a discus-sion of ammonia metabolism.)\n 2. Asparagine:  This amino acid, which contains an amide linkage with \nammonia at the \u03b2-carboxyl, is formed from aspartate by asparagine \nsynthetase,  using glutamine as the amide donor. Like the synthesis \nof glutamine, the reaction requires ATP and has an equilibrium far in the direction of amide synthesis.\nC. Proline\nGlutamate via glutamate semialdehyde is converted to proline by cycli-zation and reduction reactions. [Note: The semialdehyde can also be transaminated to ornithine.]\nD. Serine, glycine, and cysteine\nThe pathways of synthesis for these amino acids are interconnected.\n 1. Serine:  This amino acid arises from 3-phosphoglycerate, a glyco-\nlytic intermediate (see Fig. 13.18, p. 198), which is first oxidized to 3-phosphopyruvate and then transaminated to 3-phosphoserine. Serine is formed by hydrolysis of the phosphate ester. Serine can also be formed from glycine through transfer of a hydroxymethyl group by serine hydroxymethyltransferase  using N\n5,N10-MTHF as \nthe one-carbon donor (see Fig. 25.6A ). [Note: Selenocysteine (Sec), \nthe 21st genetically encoded amino acid, is synthesized from serine and selenium (see p. 561), while serine is attached to transfer RNA. Sec is found in ~25 human proteins including glutathione peroxi-\ndase  (see p. 148) and thioredoxin reductase  (see p. 579).]\n 2. Glycine:  This amino acid is synthesized from serine by removal of a \nhydroxymethyl group, also by serine hydroxymethyltransferase  (see \nFig. 25.6A ). THF is the one-carbon acceptor.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   403 24-10-2020   12:10:43"

Cysteine:  This amino acid is synthesized by two consecutive reac-\ntions in which Hcy combines with serine, forming cystathionine, which, in turn, is hydrolyzed to \u03b1-ketobutyrate and cysteine (see \nFig. 25.8 ). [Note: Hcy is derived from methionine, as described on \np. 400. Because methionine is an essential amino acid, cysteine synthesis requires adequate dietary intake of methionine.]\nE. Tyrosine\nTyrosine is formed from phenylalanine by PAH (see p. 398). The reac-\ntion requires molecular oxygen and the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\n4), which is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate. One atom \nof molecular oxygen becomes the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, and the other atom is reduced to water. During the reaction, BH\n4 is oxidized \nto dihydrobiopterin (BH 2). BH 4 is regenerated from BH 2 by NADH-\nrequiring dihydropteridine reductase.  Tyrosine, like cysteine, is formed \nfrom an essential amino acid and is, therefore, nonessential only in the presence of adequate dietary phenylalanine.\nVI. AMINO ACID METABOLISM DISORDERS\nThese single gene disorders, a subset of the inborn errors of metabo-lism, are caused by mutations that generally result in abnormal proteins, most often enzymes. The inherited defects may be expressed as a total loss of enzyme activity or, more frequently, as a partial deficiency in cata-lytic activity. Without treatment, the amino acid disorders almost invari-ably result in intellectual disability or other developmental abnormalities as a consequence of harmful accumulation of metabolites. Although >50 of these disorders have been described, many are rare, occurring in <1 per 250,000 in most populations (\nFig. 25.14 ). Collectively, however, they consti-\ntute a very significant portion of pediatric genetic diseases ( Fig. 25.15 ).\nA. Phenylketonuria\nPKU is the most common clinically encountered inborn error of amino acid metabolism (incidence 1:15,000). It is caused by a deficiency of PAH (\nFig. 25.16 ). Biochemically, PKU is characterized by hyperphenyl-\nalaninemia. Phenylalanine is present in high concentrations (ten times normal) not only in plasma but also in urine and body tissues. Tyrosine, which normally is formed from phenylalanine by PAH, is deficient. \nTreatment includes dietary restriction of phenylalanine and supplemen-tation with tyrosine. [Note: Hyperphenylalaninemia may also be caused by rare deficiencies in any of the several enzymes required to synthesize BH\n4 or in dihydropteridine reductase , which regenerates BH 4 from BH 2 \n(Fig. 25.17 ). Such deficiencies indirectly raise phenylalanine concentra-\ntions, because PAH requires BH 4 as a coenzyme. BH 4 is also required for \ntyrosine hydroxylase  and tryptophan hydroxylase , which catalyze reac-\ntions leading to the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and the catecholamines. Simply restricting dietary phenylalanine does not reverse the central nervous system effects due to deficiencies in neurotransmitters. Supplementation with BH\n4 and replacement therapy \nwith L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (products \nof the affected tyrosine hydroxylase\u2013  and tryptophan hydroxylase \u2013cata-\nlyzed reactions) improves the clinical outcome in these variant forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, although the response is unpredictable.]a-KETOGLUTARATEOXALOACETATEPYRUVATE\nGlutamateAspartateAlanineAmino acid a-Keto acid\nAmino acid a-Keto acid\nAmino acid a-Keto acidAminotransferase\nPLP\nAminotransferase\nPLP\nAminotransferase\nPLP\nFigure 25.13\nFormation of alanine, aspartate, and \nglutamate from the corresponding \u03b1-keto \nacids by transamination.

Amino Acids: Degradation and Synthesis\nScreening of newborns for a number of treatable disorders, \nincluding inborn errors of amino acid metabolism, is done by tandem mass spectrometry of blood obtained from a heel prick. By law, all states must screen for >20 disorders, with some screening for >50. All states screen for PKU.\n 1. Additional characteristics:  As the name suggests, PKU is also \ncharacterized by elevated levels of a phenylketone in the urine.\n a. Elevated phenylalanine metabolites:  Phenylpyruvate (a \nphenylketone), phenylacetate, and phenyllactate, which are not normally produced in significant amounts in the presence of functional PAH, are elevated in PKU (\nFig. 25.18 ). These metab-\nolites give urine a characteristic musty (\u201cmousy\u201d) odor.\n b. Central nervous system effects:  Severe intellectual disability, \ndevelopmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures are charac-teristic findings in untreated PKU. The affected individual typi-cally shows symptoms of intellectual disability by age 1 year and rarely achieves an intelligence quotient (IQ) >50 (\nFig. 25.19 ). \n[Note: These clinical manifestations are now rarely seen as a result of newborn screening programs, which allow early diag-nosis and treatment.]\n c. Hypopigmentation:  Patients with untreated PKU may show a \ndeficiency of pigmentation (fair hair, light skin color, and blue eyes). The hydroxylation of tyrosine by copper-requiring tyros-\ninase , which is the first step in the formation of the pigment \nmelanin, is decreased in PKU because tyrosine is decreased.\n 2.

However, the infant with PKU frequently has normal blood levels of phenylalanine at birth because the mother clears increased blood phenylalanine in her affected fetus through the placenta. Normal levels of phenylalanine may persist until the newborn is exposed to 24\u201348 hours of protein feeding. Thus, screening tests are typically done after this time to avoid false negatives. For newborns with a positive screening test, diagnosis is confirmed through quantitative determination of phenylalanine levels.\n 3. Prenatal diagnosis:  Classic PKU is caused by any of 100 or more \ndifferent mutations in the gene that encodes PAH. The frequency \nof any given mutation varies among populations, and the disease is often doubly heterozygous (that is, the PAH gene has a different \nmutation in each allele). Despite this complexity, prenatal diagnosis is possible (see p. 685).\n 4. Treatment:  Because most natural protein contains phenylalanine, \nan essential amino acid, it is impossible to satisfy the body\u2019s protein requirement without exceeding the phenylalanine limit when ingesting a normal diet. Therefore, in PKU, blood phenylalanine level is main-tained close to the normal range by feeding synthetic amino acid preparations free of phenylalanine, supplemented with some natural foods (such as fruits, vegetables, and certain cereals) selected for their low phenylalanine content. The amount is adjusted according to the tolerance of the individual as measured by blood phenylal-anine levels. The earlier treatment is started, the more completely neurologic damage can be prevented. Individuals who are appro-priately treated can have normal intelligence. [Note: Treatment must begin during the first 7\u201310 days of life to prevent cognitive impair-ment.] Because phenylalanine is an essential amino acid, over-zealous treatment that results in blood phenylalanine levels below normal is avoided. In patients with PKU, tyrosine cannot be synthe-sized from phenylalanine, and, therefore, it becomes an essential amino acid and must be supplied in the diet. Discontinuance of the phenylalanine-restricted diet in early childhood is associated with poor performance on IQ tests. Adult PKU patients show dete-rioration of IQ scores after discontinuation of the diet (\nFig. 25.20 ). \nTherefore, lifelong restriction of dietary phenylalanine is recom-mended. [Note: Individuals with PKU are advised to avoid aspar-tame, an artificial sweetener that contains phenylalanine.]\n 5. Maternal phenylketonuria:  If women with PKU who are not on \na low-phenylalanine diet become pregnant, the offspring can be affected with maternal PKU syndrome. High blood phenylala-nine in the mother has a teratogenic effect, causing microcephaly and congenital heart abnormalities in the fetus. Because these developmental responses to high phenylalanine occur during the first months of pregnancy, dietary control of blood phenylalanine must begin prior to conception and be maintained throughout the pregnancy.\nB.

These BCAA and \ntheir corresponding \u03b1-keto acids accumulate in the blood, causing a \ntoxic effect that interferes with brain functions. The disease is charac-terized by feeding problems, vomiting, ketoacidosis, changes in muscle tone, neurologic problems that can result in coma (primarily because of the rise in leucine), and a characteristic maple syrup\u2013like odor of the urine because of the rise in isoleucine. If untreated, the disease is fatal. If treatment is delayed, intellectual disability results.\n 1. Classification:  MSUD includes a classic type and several variant \nforms. The classic, neonatal-onset form is the most common type of MSUD. Leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts from these patients show little or no BCKD  activity. Infants with classic MSUD show \nsymptoms within the first several days of life. If not diagnosed and treated, classic MSUD is lethal in the first weeks of life. Patients with intermediate forms have a higher level of enzyme activity (up to 30% of normal). The symptoms are milder and show an onset from infancy to adolescence. Patients with the rare thiamine-dependent variant of MSUD respond to large doses of this vitamin.\n 2. Screening and diagnosis:  As with PKU, prenatal diagnosis and \nnewborn screening are available, and most affected individuals are compound heterozygotes.\n 3. Treatment:  MSUD is treated with a synthetic formula that is free of \nBCAA, supplemented with limited amounts of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to allow for normal growth and development without producing toxic levels. [Note: Elevated leucine is the cause of the neurologic damage in MSUD, and its level is carefully monitored.] Early diagnosis and lifelong dietary treatment are essential if the child with MSUD is to develop normally. [Note: BCAA are an impor-tant energy source in times of metabolic need, and individuals with MSUD are at risk of decompensation during periods of increased protein catabolism.]\nC. Albinism\nAlbinism refers to a group of conditions in which a defect in tyrosine metabolism results in a deficiency in the production of melanin. These defects result in the partial or full absence of pigment from the skin, hair, and eyes. Albinism appears in different forms, and it may be inherited by one of several modes: autosomal recessive (primary mode), autosomal dominant, or X linked. Total absence of pigment from the hair, eyes, and skin (\nFig. 25.21 ), tyrosinase -negative oculocutaneous albinism (type 1 \nalbinism), results from an absent or defective copper-requiring tyrosi-\nnase . It is the most severe form of the condition. In addition to hypopig-\nmentation, affected individuals have vision defects and photophobia (sunlight hurts their eyes). They are at increased risk for skin cancer.\nD. Homocystinuria\nThe homocystinurias are a group of disorders involving defects in the metabolism of Hcy. These autosomal-recessive diseases are \nFigure 25.21\nPatient with oculocutaneous albinism, showing white eyebrows and lashes and eyes that appear red in color.012370\nYears after discontinuation of diet100\n8090110IQ\nFigure 25.20\nChanges in intelligence quotient (IQ) \nscores after discontinuation of low-phenylalanine diet in patients with phenylketonuria.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   408 24-10-2020   12:10:46"

The most common cause of homocystinuria is a defect in the enzyme cystathi-\nonine \u03b2-synthase , which converts Hcy to cystathionine (\nFig. 25.22 ). \nIndividuals homozygous for cystathionine \u03b2-synthase  deficiency exhibit \ndislocation of the lens (ectopia lentis), skeletal anomalies (long limbs and fingers), intellectual disability, and an increased risk for devel-oping thrombi (blood clots). Thrombosis is the major cause of early death in these individuals. Treatment includes restriction of methionine and supplementation with vitamin B\n12 and folate. Additionally, some \npatients are responsive to oral administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B 6), \nwhich is converted to pyridoxal phosphate, the coenzyme of cystathi-\nonine \u03b2-synthase.  These patients usually have a milder and later onset \nof clinical symptoms compared with B 6-nonresponsive patients. [Note: \nDeficiencies in methylcobalamin (see Fig. 25.8 ) or N5,N10-MTHF reduc-\ntase ([MTHFR ]; see Fig. 25.12 ) also result in elevated Hcy.]\nE. Alkaptonuria\nAlkaptonuria is a rare organic aciduria involving a deficiency in homo-\ngentisic acid oxidase , resulting in the accumulation of homogentisic \nacid (HA), an intermediate in the degradative pathway of tyrosine (see \nFig. 25.15  on p. 405). The condition has three characteristic symptoms: \nhomogentisic aciduria (the urine contains elevated levels of HA, which is oxidized to a dark pigment on standing, as shown in \nFig. 25.23A ), early \nonset of arthritis in the large joints, and deposition of black pigment (ochronosis) in cartilage and collagenous tissue (see \nFig. 25.23B ). Dark \nstaining of diapers can indicate the disease in infants, but usually no symptoms are present until about age 40 years. Treatment includes dietary restriction of phenylalanine and tyrosine to reduce HA levels. Although alkaptonuria is not life threatening, the associated arthritis may be severely crippling. [Note: Deficiencies in fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase , the terminal enzyme of tyrosine metabolism, result in tyro-\nsinemia type I (see \nFig. 25.15 ) and a characteristic cabbage-like odor \nto urine.]\nVII. Medical Perspectives\nNewborn screening is advised for all neonates to check for inborn errors of \nmetabolism at the very early stage. Late diagnosis of these disorders may lead to mental retardation and other irreparable damages. The common diseases required to be tested are hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, G6PD deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, phenylketonuria and galactosemia. Tandem mass spectroscopy is used to detect amino acid disorders like phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, maple syrup urine disease and hypermethioninemia. Some of these disorders can be well managed if diag-nosed early before irreparable damage has taken place, e.g., phenylketon-uria can be well managed by a lifelong low-protein phenylalanine restricted diet. But if mental retardation has set in because of delayed diagnosis and treatment, that cannot be reversed.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   409 24-10-2020   12:10:47"

Chapter Summary\nAmino acids  whose catabolism yields pyruvate  or an intermediate  of \nthe tricarboxylic acid cycle  are termed glucogenic  (Fig. 25.24 ). They \ncan give rise to the net formation of glucose  in the liver and kidneys . \nThe solely glucogenic amino acids are glutamine, glutamate, proline, argi-nine, histidine, alanine, serine, glycine, cysteine, methionine, valine, thre-onine, aspartate, and asparagine. Amino acids whose catabolism yields either acetoacetate  or one of its precursors, acetyl coenzyme A  (CoA) \nor acetoacetyl CoA , are termed ketogenic . Leucine and lysine are solely \nketogenic. Tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and isoleucine are both ketogenic and glucogenic. Nonessential amino acids  can be synthesized \nfrom metabolic intermediates or from the carbon skeletons of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids  need to be obtained from the diet. \nThey include histidine, methionine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, phenylala-nine, tryptophan, leucine, and lysine. Phenylketonuria  (PKU ) is caused by \na deficiency  of phenylalanine hydroxylase  (PAH), which converts phenyl-\nalanine to tyrosine. Hyperphenylalaninemia  may also be caused by defi-\nciencies in the enzymes that synthesize or regenerate the coenzyme for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin . Untreated individuals with PKU suffer from \nsevere intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, and a characteristic musty (mousy) smell of the urine. Treatment involves controlling dietary phenylalanine. Tyrosine  becomes an essential dietary \ncomponent for people with PKU. Maple syrup urine disease  (MSUD ) is \ncaused by a partial or complete deficiency in branched-chain a-keto acid \ndehydrogenase , the enzyme that decarboxylates the branched-chain \namino acids  (BCAA ) leucine , isoleucine , and valine . Symptoms include \nfeeding problems, vomiting, ketoacidosis, changes in muscle tone, and a characteristic sweet smell of the urine. If untreated, the disease leads to neurologic problems that result in death. Treatment involves controlling BCAA intake. Other important genetic diseases associated with amino acid metabolism include albinism , homocystinuria , methylmalonic acidemia , \nalkaptonuria , histidinemia , tyrosinemia , and cystathioninuria .\nThe specimen on the left, \nwhich has been standing for 15 minutes, shows some darkening at the surface, due to the oxidation of homogentisic acid.After 2 hours, the \nurine is entirely black.\n12\nDense, black pigment is deposited on the intervertebral disks of the vertebrae.BUrine from a patient \nwith alkaptonuria\nVertebrae from a patient\nwith alkaptonuriaA\nFigure 25.23\nSpecimens from a patient with \nalkaptonuria.

OVERVIEW\nUnlike fats and carbohydrates, amino acids are not stored by the body. \nThat is, no protein exists whose sole function is to maintain a supply of \namino acids for future use. Therefore, amino acids must be obtained from \nthe diet, synthesized de novo, or produced from the degradation of body \nprotein. Any amino acids in excess of the biosynthetic needs of the cell \nare rapidly degraded. The first phase of catabolism involves the removal \nof the \u03b1-amino groups (usually by transamination and subsequent oxida-\ntive deamination), forming ammonia and the corresponding \u03b1-keto acids, \nthe carbon skeletons of amino acids. A portion of the free ammonia is \nexcreted in the urine, but most is used in the synthesis of urea ( Fig. 24.1 ), \nwhich is quantitatively the most important route for disposing of nitrogen \nfrom the body. In the second phase of amino acid catabolism, described \nin Chapter 25, the carbon skeletons of the \u03b1-keto acids are converted to \ncommon intermediates of energy-producing metabolic pathways. These \ncompounds can be metabolized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H 2O), \nglucose, fatty acids, or ketone bodies by the central pathways of metabo-\nlism described in Units III and IV.\nII.

Most babies with metabolic disorders look normal at birth. Newborn screening is commonly done for hypothyroidism, congen-ital adrenal hypoplasia, G6PD deficiency, phenylketon-uria and galactosemia. Delayed milestones, poor feeding, choking episodes, puffy face and thick protruding tongue are features suggestive of neonatal hypothyroidism. A diagnosis in time can save the baby from mental retarda-tion, morbidity and mortality. Hence the pediatrician chose to get this screening done while looking for infective and other causes of delayed milestones.25.1. An 8-month-old baby was brought to the pedia-\ntrician by a mother of three children. The mother is a known case of hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. The doctor observed that the child cannot sit without support. The mother also reports poor feeding and choking episodes. He was born at home and not shown to any doctor.

OVERVIEW\nIn addition to serving as building blocks for proteins, amino acids are \nprecursors of many nitrogen-containing compounds that have important physiologic functions (\nFig. 26.1 ). These molecules include porphyrins, \nneurotransmitters, hormones, purines, and pyrimidines. [Note: See p. 256 for the synthesis of nitric oxide from arginine.]\nII. PORPHYRIN METABOLISM\nPorphyrins are cyclic compounds that readily bind metal ions, usually ferrous (Fe\n2+) or ferric (Fe3+) iron. The most prevalent metalloporphyrin in \nhumans is heme, which consists of one Fe2+ coordinated in the center of \nthe tetrapyrrole ring of protoporphyrin IX (see p. 416). Heme is the prosthetic group for hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, the cytochromes, the cytochrome \nP450  (CYP) monooxygenase  system, catalase , nitric oxide synthase , and \nperoxidase . These hemeproteins are rapidly synthesized and degraded. For \nexample, 6\u20137 g of Hb is synthesized each day to replace heme lost through the normal turnover of erythrocytes. The synthesis and degradation of the associated porphyrins and recycling of the iron are coordinated with the turnover of hemeproteins.\nA.

Porphyrinogens:  These porphyrin precursors (for example, uropor-\nphyrinogen) exist in a chemically reduced, colorless form and serve as intermediates between porphobilinogen (PBG) and the oxidized, colored protoporphyrins in heme biosynthesis.\nB. Heme biosynthesis\nThe major sites of heme biosynthesis are the liver, which synthesizes a number of heme proteins (particularly the CYP proteins), and the \nerythrocyte-producing cells of the bone marrow, which are active in Hb synthesis. In the liver, the rate of heme synthesis is highly vari-able, responding to alterations in the cellular heme pool caused by fluctuating demands for hemeproteins. In contrast, heme synthesis in erythroid cells is relatively constant and is matched to the rate of globin synthesis. [Note: Over 85% of all heme synthesis occurs in erythroid tissue. Mature red blood cells (RBC) lack mitochondria and are unable to synthesize heme.] The initial reaction and the last three steps in the formation of porphyrins occur in mitochondria, whereas the interme-diate steps of the biosynthetic pathway occur in the cytosol. [Note: \nFig. 26.8  summarizes heme synthesis.]\n 1. \u03b4-Aminolevulinic acid formation:  All the carbon and nitrogen \natoms of the porphyrin molecule are provided by glycine (a nones-sential amino acid) and succinyl coenzyme A (a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate) that condense to form \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid \n(ALA) in a reaction catalyzed by ALA synthase  ([ALAS ], \nFig. 26.3 ). \nThis reaction requires pyridoxal phosphate ([PLP], see p. 529) as a coenzyme and is the committed and rate-limiting step in porphyrin biosynthesis. [Note: There are two ALAS  isoforms, each produced \nby different genes and controlled by different mechanisms. ALAS1  \nis found in all tissues, whereas ALAS2  is erythroid specific. Loss-of-\nfunction mutations in ALAS2  result in X-linked sideroblastic anemia \nand iron overload.]\n a. Heme (hemin) effects:  When porphyrin production exceeds \nthe availability of the apoproteins that require it, heme accumu-lates and is converted to hemin by the oxidation of Fe\n2+ to Fe3+. \nHemin decreases the amount (and, thus, the activity) of ALAS1  \nby repressing transcription of its gene, increasing degradation of its messenger RNA, and decreasing import of the enzyme into mitochondria. [Note: In erythroid cells, ALAS2  is controlled \nby the availability of intracellular iron (see p. 666).]Figure 26.3 \nPathway of porphyrin synthesis: \nFormation of porphobilinogen.

Drug effects:  Administration of any of a large number of drugs \nresults in a significant increase in hepatic ALAS1  activity. \nThese drugs are metabolized by the microsomal CYP mono-\noxygenase  system, a hemeprotein oxidase  system found in the \nliver (see p. 254). In response to these drugs, the synthesis of CYP proteins increases, leading to an enhanced consumption \nof heme, a component of these proteins. This, in turn, causes a decrease in the concentration of heme in liver cells. The lower intracellular heme concentration leads to an increase in the synthesis of ALAS1  and prompts a corresponding increase in \nthe synthesis of ALA.\n 2. Porphobilinogen formation:  The cytosolic condensation of \ntwo ALA to form PBG by zinc-containing ALA dehydratase (PBG \nsynthase)  is extremely sensitive to inhibition by heavy metal ions (for \nexample, lead) that replace the zinc (see \nFig. 26.3 ). This inhibition is, \nin part, responsible for the elevation in ALA and the anemia seen in lead poisoning.\n 3. Uroporphyrinogen formation:  The condensation of four PBG \nproduces the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane, which is cyclized and isomerized by uroporphyrinogen III synthase  to \nproduce the asymmetric uroporphyrinogen III. This cyclic tetrapyr-role undergoes decarboxylation of its acetate groups by uroporphy-\nrinogen III decarboxylase  (UROD ), generating coproporphyrinogen III \n(\nFig. 26.4 ). The reactions occur in the cytosol.\n 4. Heme formation:  Coproporphyrinogen III enters the mitochondrion, \nand two propionate side chains are decarboxylated by copropor-\nphyrinogen III oxidase  to vinyl groups generating protoporphyrin-\nogen IX, which is oxidized to protoporphyrin IX. The introduction of iron (as Fe\n2+) into protoporphyrin IX produces heme. This step can \noccur spontaneously, but the rate is enhanced by ferrochelatase , an \nenzyme that, like ALA dehydratase , is inhibited by lead ( Fig. 26.5 ).\nC. Porphyrias\nPorphyrias are rare, inherited (or sometimes acquired) defects in heme \nsynthesis, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors (see \nFig. 26.8 ). [Note: Inherited \nporphyrias are autosominal-dominant (AD) or autosomal-recessive (AR) disorders.] Each porphyria results in the accumulation of a unique pattern of intermediates caused by the deficiency of an enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway. [Note: Porphyria, derived from the Greek for purple, refers to the red-blue color caused by pigment-like porphyrins in the urine of some patients with defects in heme synthesis.]\n 1. Clinical manifestations:  The porphyrias are classified as erythro-\npoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in the erythropoietic cells of the bone marrow or in the liver. Hepatic porphyrias can be further classified as chronic or acute. In general, individuals with an enzyme defect prior to the synthesis of the tetrapyrroles manifest abdominal and neuropsychiatric signs, whereas those with enzyme defects leading to the accumulation of tetrapyrrole intermediates show photosensitivity (that is, their skin itches and burns [pruritus] when exposed to sunlight). [Note: Photosensitivity is a result of the oxidation of colorless porphyrino-gens to colored porphyrins, which are photosensitizing molecules \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   417 24-10-2020   12:10:52"

These radicals can oxidatively damage membranes and cause the release of destructive enzymes from lysosomes.]\n a. Chronic hepatic porphyria:  Porphyria cutanea tarda, the most \ncommon porphyria, is a chronic disease of the liver. The disease is associated with severe deficiency of UROD , but clinical \nexpression of the deficiency is influenced by various factors, such as hepatic iron overload, exposure to sunlight, alcohol ingestion, estrogen therapy, and the presence of hepatitis B or C or HIV infections. [Note: Mutations to UROD  are found in only \n20% of affected individuals. Inheritance is AD.] Clinical onset is typically during the fourth or fifth decade of life. Porphyrin accu-mulation leads to cutaneous symptoms (\nFig. 26.6 ) as well as \nurine that is red to brown in natural light ( Fig. 26.7 ) and pink to \nred in fluorescent light.\n b. Acute hepatic porphyrias:  Acute hepatic porphyrias ( ALA \ndehydratase \u2013deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, \nhereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria) are char-acterized by acute attacks of gastrointestinal (GI), neuropsy-chiatric, and motor symptoms that may be accompanied by photosensitivity (\nFig. 26.8 ). Porphyrias leading to accumulation \nof ALA and PBG, such as acute intermittent porphyria, cause abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric disturbances, ranging from anxiety to delirium. Symptoms of the acute hepatic porphyrias are often precipitated by use of drugs, such as barbiturates and ethanol, which induce the synthesis of the heme-containing CYP \nmicrosomal drug-oxidation system. This further decreases the amount of available heme, which, in turn, promotes increased synthesis of ALAS1 .\n c. Erythropoietic porphyrias:  The chronic erythropoietic \nporphyrias (congenital erythropoietic porphyria and erythropoi-etic protoporphyria) cause photosensitivity characterized by skin rashes and blisters that appear in early childhood (see \nFig. 26.8 ).\n 2. Increased \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity:  One common \nfeature of the hepatic porphyrias is decreased synthesis of heme. In the liver, heme normally functions as a repressor of the ALAS1  gene. \nTherefore, the absence of this end product results in an increase in the synthesis of ALAS1  (derepression). This causes an increased \nsynthesis of intermediates that occur prior to the genetic block. The accumulation of these toxic intermediates is the major pathophysi-ology of the porphyrias.\n 3. Laboratory diagnosis of porphyrias:  The samples for PBG should \nbe collected preferably during an acute attack.\nIn hereditary coproporphyria, urine and fecal coproporphyrin-III are \nelevated. In variegate porphyria, urine and fecal coproporphyrin-III and fecal protoporphyrin-IX are elevated. \nAcidified urine or fecal extracts containing porphyrins absorb light \nat 400 nm, which can be detected spectrophotometrically \u2013 the so-called Soret band or Soret peak.

Treatment:  During acute porphyria attacks, patients require medical \nsupport, particularly treatment for pain and vomiting. The severity of acute symptoms of the porphyrias can be diminished by intrave-nous injection of hemin and glucose, which decreases the synthesis of ALAS1 . Protection from sunlight, ingestion of \u03b2-carotene (provi-\ntamin A; see p. 534) that scavenges free radicals, and phlebotomy (removes porphyrins) are helpful in porphyrias with photosensitivity.\nD. Heme degradation\nAfter ~120 days in the circulation, RBC are taken up and degraded by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), particularly in the liver and spleen (\nFig. 26.9 ). Approximately 85% of heme destined for degrada-\ntion comes from senescent RBC. The remainder is from the degrada-tion of hemeproteins other than Hb.\n 1. Bilirubin formation:  The first step in the degradation of heme is \ncatalyzed by microsomal heme oxygenase  in macrophages of the \nMPS. In the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos-phate and oxygen, the enzyme catalyzes three successive oxygen-ations that result in opening of the porphyrin ring (converting cyclic heme to linear biliverdin), production of carbon monoxide (CO), and release of Fe\n2+ (see Fig. 26.9 ). [Note: The CO has biologic func-\ntion, acting as a signaling molecule and anti-inflammatory. Iron is discussed in Chapter 33.] Biliverdin, a green pigment, is reduced, forming the red-orange bilirubin. Bilirubin and its derivatives are collectively termed bile pigments. [Note: The changing colors of a bruise reflect the varying pattern of intermediates that occurs during heme degradation.]\nBilirubin, unique to mammals, appears to function at low \nlevels as an antioxidant. In this role, it is oxidized to biliverdin, which is then reduced by biliverdin reductase , regenerating \nbilirubin.\n 2. Bilirubin uptake by the liver:  Because bilirubin is only slightly \nsoluble in plasma, it is transported through blood to the liver by binding noncovalently to albumin. [Note: Certain anionic drugs, such as salicylates and sulfonamides, can displace bilirubin from albumin, permitting bilirubin to enter the central nervous system (CNS). This causes the potential for neural damage in infants (see p. 422).] Bilirubin dissociates from the carrier albumin molecule, enters a hepatocyte via facilitated diffusion, and binds to intracel-lular proteins, particularly the protein ligandin.\n 3. Bilirubin diglucuronide formation:  In the hepatocyte, bilirubin \nsolubility is increased by the sequential addition of two molecules of glucuronic acid in a process called conjugation. The reactions are catalyzed by microsomal bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase  (bili-\nrubin UGT ) using uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronic acid as the \nglucuronate donor. The bilirubin diglucuronide product is referred to as conjugated bilirubin (CB). [Note: Varying degrees of deficiency of bilirubin UGT  result in Crigler-Najjar I and II and Gilbert syndrome, \nwith Crigler-Najjar I being the most severe.]\n 4. Bilirubin secretion into bile:  CB is actively transported against \na concentration gradient into the bile canaliculi and then into the \nFigure 26.9 \nFormation of bilirubin from heme and its conversion to bilirubin diglucuronide.

Urobilin formation in the intestine:  CB is hydrolyzed and reduced \nby gut bacteria to yield urobilinogen, a colorless compound. Most of the urobilinogen is further oxidized by bacteria to stercobilin, which gives feces the characteristic brown color. However, some is reab-sorbed from the gut and enters the portal blood. A portion of this urobilinogen participates in the enterohepatic urobilinogen cycle in which it is taken up by the liver and then resecreted into the bile. The remainder of the urobilinogen is transported by the blood to the kidney, where it is converted to yellow urobilin and excreted, giving urine its characteristic color.

Jaundice\nJaundice (or, icterus) refers to the yellow color of skin, nail beds, and \nsclerae (whites of the eyes) caused by bilirubin deposition, secondary to increased bilirubin levels in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) as shown in \nFigure 26.11 . Although not a disease, jaundice is usually a symptom \nof an underlying disorder. [Note: Blood bilirubin levels are normally \u22641 mg/dl. Jaundice is seen at 2\u20133 mg/dl.]\n 1. Types:  Jaundice can be classified into three major types described \nbelow. However, in clinical practice, jaundice is often more complex than indicated in this simple classification. For example, the accu-mulation of bilirubin may be a result of defects at more than one step in its metabolism.\n a. Hemolytic (prehepatic):  The liver has the capacity to conjugate \nand excrete >3,000 mg of bilirubin/day, whereas the normal production of bilirubin is only 300 mg/day. This excess capacity allows the liver to respond to increased heme degradation with a corresponding increase in conjugation and secretion of CB. However, extensive hemolysis (for example, in patients with sickle cell anemia or deficiency of pyruvate kinase  or glucose \n6-phosphate dehydrogenase ) may produce bilirubin faster \nthan it can be conjugated. UCB levels in the blood become elevated (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia), causing jaundice (\nFig. 26.12A ). [Note: With hemolysis, more CB is made and \nexcreted into the bile, the amount of urobilinogen entering the enterohepatic circulation is increased, and urinary urobilinogen is increased.]\n b. Hepatocellular (hepatic):  Damage to liver cells (for example, \nin patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis) can cause unconju-gated hyperbilirubinemia as a result of decreased conjugation. Urobilinogen is increased in the urine because hepatic damage decreases the enterohepatic circulation of this compound, allowing more to enter the blood, from which it is filtered into the urine. The urine consequently darkens, whereas stools may be a pale, clay color. Plasma levels of alanine  and aspartate trans-\naminases  (ALT and AST, respectively; see p. 383) are elevated. \nIf CB is made but is not efficiently secreted from the liver into bile (intrahepatic cholestasis), it can leak into the blood (regur-gitation), causing a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n c. Obstructive (posthepatic):  In this instance, jaundice is not \ncaused by overproduction of bilirubin or decreased conjuga-tion but, instead, results from obstruction of the common bile duct (extrahepatic cholestasis). For example, the presence of a tumor or bile stones may block the duct, preventing passage of CB into the intestine. Patients with obstructive jaundice experience GI pain and nausea and produce stools that are a pale, clay color. The CB regurgitates into the blood (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia). The CB is eventually excreted in the urine (which darkens over time) and is referred to as urinary bilirubin. Urinary urobilinogen is absent.\n 2. Jaundice in newborns:  Most newborn infants (60% of full term and \n80% of preterm) show a rise in UCB in the first postnatal week (and a transient, physiologic jaundice) because the activity of hepatic bili-\nrubin UGT  is low at birth (it reaches adult levels in about 4 weeks), Figure 26.11 \nJaundiced patient with the sclerae of his \neyes appearing yellow.\nFigure 26.12 \nAlterations in the metabolism of heme.

Elevated UCB, in excess \nof the binding capacity of albumin (20\u201325 mg/dl), can diffuse into the basal ganglia, causing toxic encephalopathy (kernicterus) and a pathologic jaundice. Therefore, newborns with significantly elevated bilirubin levels are treated with blue fluorescent light (phototherapy), as shown in \nFigure 26.14 , which converts bilirubin to more polar \nand, therefore, water-soluble isomers. These photoisomers can be excreted into the bile without conjugation to glucuronic acid. [Note: Because of solubility differences, only UCB crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, and only CB appears in urine.]\n 3. Bilirubin measurement:  Bilirubin is commonly measured by the \nvan den Bergh reaction, in which diazotized sulfanilic acid reacts with bilirubin to form red azodipyrroles that are measured colori-metrically. In aqueous solution, the water-soluble CB reacts rapidly with the reagent (within 1 minute) and is said to be direct reacting. The UCB, which is much less soluble in aqueous solution, reacts more slowly. However, when the reaction is carried out in methanol, both CB and UCB are soluble and react with the reagent, providing the total bilirubin value. The indirect-reacting bilirubin, which corre-sponds to the UCB, is obtained by subtracting the direct-reacting bilirubin from the total bilirubin. [Note: In normal plasma, only ~4% of the total bilirubin is conjugated, or direct reacting, because most is secreted into bile.]\nIII. OTHER NITROGEN-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS\nA. Catecholamines\nDopamine, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (or, adrenaline) are biologically active (biogenic) amines that are collectively termed cate-cholamines. Dopamine and NE are synthesized in the brain and func-tion as neurotransmitters. Epinephrine is synthesized from NE in the adrenal medulla.\n 1. Function:  Outside the CNS, NE and its methylated derivative, \nepinephrine, are hormone regulators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. NE and epinephrine are released from storage vesi-cles in the adrenal medulla in response to fright, exercise, cold, and low levels of blood glucose. They increase the degradation of glycogen and triacylglycerol as well as increase blood pressure and the output of the heart. These effects are part of a coordinated response to prepare the individual for stress and are often called the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d reactions.\n 2. Synthesis:  The catecholamines are synthesized from tyrosine, as \nshown in \nFigure 26.15 . Tyrosine is first hydroxylated by tyrosine \nhydroxylase  to form L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in a reac-\ntion analogous to that described for the hydroxylation of phenylal-anine (see p. 398). The tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\n4)-requiring enzyme \nis abundant in the CNS, the sympathetic ganglia, and the adrenal medulla, and it catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the pathway. DOPA is decarboxylated in a reaction requiring PLP to form dopa-mine, which is hydroxylated by dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase  to yield NE \nin a reaction that requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and copper. Epinephrine is formed from NE by an N-methylation reaction using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor (see p. 399).Figure 26.13\nNeonatal jaundice.

Amino Acids: Conversion to Specialized Products Including Porphyrins\nParkinson disease, a neurodegenerative movement disorder, \nis due to insufficient dopamine production as a result of the idiopathic loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Administration of \nL-DOPA (levodopa) is the most common \ntreatment, because dopamine cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n 3. Degradation:  The catecholamines are inactivated by oxida-\ntive deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase  (MAO ) and by \nO-methylation catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase  (COMT ) \nusing SAM as the methyl donor ( Fig. 26.16 ). The reactions can \noccur in either order. The aldehyde products of the MAO  reaction \nare oxidized to the corresponding acids. The products of these reactions are excreted in the urine as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) from epinephrine and NE and homovanillic acid (HVA) from dopa-mine. [Note: VMA and the metanephrines are increased with pheo-chromocytomas, rare tumors of the adrenal gland characterized by excessive production of catecholamines.]\n 4. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors:  MAO  is found in neural and other \ntissues, such as the intestine and liver. In the neuron, this enzyme oxidatively deaminates and inactivates any excess neurotrans-mitter molecules (NE, dopamine, or serotonin) that may leak out of synaptic vesicles when the neuron is at rest. MAO  inhibitors \n(MAOI) may irreversibly or reversibly inactivate the enzyme, permit-ting neurotransmitter molecules to escape degradation and, there-fore, both to accumulate within the presynaptic neuron and to leak into the synaptic space.

Histamine\nHistamine is a chemical messenger that mediates a wide range of \ncellular responses, including allergic and inflammatory reactions and gastric acid secretion. A powerful vasodilator, histamine is formed by decarboxylation of histidine in a reaction requiring PLP (\nFig. 26.17 ). It \nis secreted by mast cells as a result of allergic reactions or trauma. Histamine has no clinical applications, but agents that interfere with the action of histamine have important therapeutic applications.\nC. Serotonin\nSerotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is synthesized and/or stored at several sites in the body (\nFig. 26.18 ). The largest amount by \nfar is found in the intestinal mucosa. Smaller amounts occur in the CNS, where it functions as a neurotransmitter, and in platelets. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan, which is hydroxylated in a BH\n4-requiring \nreaction analogous to that catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase . The \nproduct, 5-hydroxytryptophan, is decarboxylated to 5-HT. Serotonin has multiple physiologic roles including pain perception and regulation of sleep, appetite, temperature, blood pressure, cognitive functions, and mood (causes a feeling of well-being). [Note: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) maintain serotonin levels, thereby functioning as antidepressants.] Serotonin is degraded by MAO  to 5-hydroxy-\n3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).\nD. Creatine\nCreatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine), the phosphorylated derivative of creatine found in muscle, is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phos-phates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (\nFig. 26.19 ) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few \nminutes of intense muscular contraction. [Note: The amount of creatine phosphate in the body is proportional to the muscle mass.]\n 1. Synthesis:  Creatine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from \nglycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM (see \nFig. 26.19 ). Animal products are dietary sources. \nCreatine is reversibly phosphorylated to creatine phosphate by creatine kinase , using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: The pres-\nence of creatine kinase  (MB isozyme) in the plasma is indicative of \nheart damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (see p. 147).]\n 2. Degradation:  Creatine and creatine phosphate spontaneously \ncyclize at a slow but constant rate to form creatinine, which is excreted in the urine. The amount excreted is proportional to the total creatine phosphate content of the body and, therefore, can be used to estimate muscle mass. When muscle mass decreases for any reason (for example, from paralysis or muscular dystrophy), the creatinine content of the urine falls. In addition, a rise in blood creatinine is a sensitive indicator of kidney malfunction, because creatinine normally is rapidly cleared from the blood and excreted. A typical adult male excretes ~1\u20132 g of creatinine/day.Figure 26.17\nBiosynthesis of histamine. \nPLP = pyridoxal phosphate.CH2\nNH2COO H C\nHNN\nHistidine\nCH2\nNH2NN\nCH2\nHistamineHistidine \ndecarboxylase\nCPLP\nO2\nFigure 26.18 \nSynthesis of serotonin.

Medical Perspectives\nJaundice is commonly seen in clinical practice and is basically a symptom \nof an underlying disease. It is characterized by yellow sclera, nail bed and yellowish color of skin due to deposition of bilirubin. It may be hemolytic (prehepatic), hepatocellular (damage to liver cells) or obstructive (extrahe-patic cholestasis). The type of jaundice is confirmed by testing for levels of conjugated, unconjugated and total blood bilirubin as well as levels of liver enzymes like ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , (see Liver function \ntests in chapter 48 for diagnostic  details).\nParkinsonism is a relatively common neurogenerative movement disorder \nbecause of insufficient production of dopamine in the brain. Replacement by levodopa is a common treatment.\nPorphyrias are very rare inherited disorders of heme synthesis resulting in \naccumulation of porphyrin or porphyrin precursors. The signs and symp-toms range from photosensitivity to neuropsychiatric disorders, depending on the enzymatic defect.\nPorphyrias may be exacerbated by consumption of alcohol, fasting, certain \ndrugs (e.g., barbiturates and antifungals like griseofulvin), and increased progesterone during pregnancy and during the luteal phase of menstrual cycle.E. Melanin\nMelanin is a pigment that occurs in several tissues, particularly the eye, \nhair, and skin. It is synthesized from tyrosine in melanocytes (pigment-forming cells) of the epidermis. It functions to protect underlying cells from the harmful effects of sunlight. [Note: A defect in melanin produc-tion results in oculocutaneous albinism, the most common type being due to defects in copper-containing tyrosinase  (see p. 408).]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   426 24-10-2020   12:11:04"

            "Text": "V. Chapter Summary 427\nV. Chapter Summary\nAmino acids  are precursors  of many nitrogen (N)-containing compounds including porphyrins , which, in combination \nwith ferrous  (Fe2+) iron, form heme  (Fig. 26.20 ). The major sites of heme biosynthesis  are the liver, which synthesizes \na number of hemeproteins (particularly cytochrome P450  enzymes ), and the erythrocyte-producing cells  of the bone \nmarrow, which are active in hemoglobin  synthesis. In the liver, the rate of heme synthesis is highly variable, responding \nto alterations in the cellular heme pool caused by fluctuating demands for hemeproteins. In contrast, heme synthesis in erythroid cells is relatively constant and is matched to the rate of globin synthesis. Heme synthesis starts with glycine  \nand succinyl coenzyme A . The committed step  is the formation of \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid  (ALA). This mitochondrial \nreaction is catalyzed by ALA synthase-1  (ALAS1 ) in the liver (inhibited by hemin , the oxidized form of heme that accu-\nmulates when heme is being underutilized) and ALAS2  in erythroid tissues (regulated by iron). Porphyrias  are caused by \ninherited or acquired ( lead poisoning ) defects in heme synthesis, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of \nporphyrins or porphyrin precursors. Enzymic defects early in the pathway cause abdominal pain  and neuropsychiatric \nsymptoms , whereas later defects cause photosensitivity . Degradation  of heme occurs in the mononuclear phagocyte \nsystem , particularly in the liver and spleen . The first step is the production by heme oxygenase  of biliverdin , which \nis subsequently reduced to bilirubin . Bilirubin is transported by albumin  to the liver, where its solubility is increased by \nthe addition of two molecules of glucuronic acid  by bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase  (bilirubin \nUGT ). Bilirubin diglucuronide  (conjugated bilirubin ) is transported into the bile canaliculi , where it is first hydrolyzed \nand reduced by gut bacteria to yield urobilinogen , which is further oxidized by bacteria to stercobilin . Jaundice  (icterus ) \nrefers to the yellow color of the skin and sclerae that is caused by deposition of bilirubin, secondary to increased bilirubin levels in the blood. Three commonly encountered types of jaundice are hemolytic  (prehepatic ), obstructive  (posthe-\npatic ), and \nhepatocellular  (hepatic ) (see Fig. 26.20 ). Other important N-containing compounds derived from amino acids \ninclude the catecholamines  (dopamine , norepinephrine , and epinephrine ), creatine , histamine , serotonin , melanin , \nand nitric oxide .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   427 24-10-2020   12:11:04"

            "Text": "430 26. Amino Acids: Conversion to Specialized Products Including Porphyrins\nCorrect answer = A.  This child has the acquired porphyria \nof lead poisoning. Lead inhibits both \u03b4-aminolevulinic \nacid dehydratase and ferrochelatase and, consequently, heme synthesis. The decrease in heme derepresses \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (the hepatic isozyme), \nresulting in an increase in its activity. The decrease in heme also results in decreased hemoglobin synthesis, and anemia is seen. Ferrochelatase is directly inhibited by lead. The other choices are enzymes of heme degradation.26.4. A 2-year-old child was brought to his pediatri-\ncian for evaluation of gastrointestinal problems. The parents report that the boy has been listless for the last few weeks.

FerrochelataseD. Heme oxygenaseE. Porphobilinogen synthaseCorrect answer = E.  The disease is associated with a \ndeficiency in uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD), but clinical expression of the enzyme deficiency is influ-enced by hepatic injury caused by environmental (for example, ethanol) and infectious (for example, hepatitis B virus) agents. Exposure to sunlight can also be a precipi-tating factor. Clinical onset is typically during the fourth or fifth decade of life. Porphyrin accumulation leads to cuta-neous symptoms and urine that is red to brown. Treatment of the patient\u2019s seizure disorder with phenytoin caused increased synthesis of \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid synthase and, \ntherefore, of uroporphyrinogen, the substrate of the defi-cient UROD. The laboratory and clinical findings are incon-sistent with other porphyrias.\nCorrect answer = C.  The data are consistent with an \nobstructive jaundice in which a block in the common bile duct decreases the secretion of bile containing conjugated bilirubin (CB) into the intestine (stool will be pale in color). The CB regurgitates into the blood (conjugated hyperbili-rubinemia). The CB is excreted in the urine (which darkens) and is referred to as urinary bilirubin. Urinary urobilinogen is not present because its source is intestinal urobilinogen, which is low. The other choices do not match the data.26.2.

This \nsection describes some additional clinical perspectives.\n\u2022 Vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine) deficiency (e.g., in individuals receiving isoniazid \n[see Chapter 32.V.A]) can lead to anemia because \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid \n(ALA) synthase requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the active form of pyri-doxine, as coenzyme.\n\u2022 Photodynamic therapy  refers to the use of light and a photosensitive \nchemical to bring about toxicity to the cells, in conditions like cancer. Because of the inherent photosensitive nature of porphyrins, porphyrin derivatives are among the chemicals used in photodynamic therapy. An example is porfimer sodium which is used in the treatment of esopha-geal cancer and lung cancer.\n\u2022 In hemolytic anemia, excess bilirubin in bile precipitates with calcium as \ninsoluble calcium bilirubinate, which results in formation of gallstones.\n\u2022 Unconjugated bilirubin, when bound to albumin cannot cross the blood-\nbrain barrier. Two molecules of unconjugated bilirubin bind noncovalently with one molecule of albumin. Certain drugs (like salicylates and sulfon-amides) can displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in individuals with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias.\n\u2022 Conjugated bilirubin in circulation (e.g., in hepatitis and obstructive jaun-\ndice) can bind covalently with albumin to form \u03b4-bilirubin, also known as \nbiliprotein. This leads to persistence of bilirubin in circulation in choles-tatic conditions, since the half-life of bilirubin (originally 4 hours) will now be same as that of albumin (half-life, 14 days). This might mislead the clinicians who encounter otherwise significant clinical improvement in their patients who are being treated for hepatitis or cholestasis.\n\u2022 Blue to blue-green light (460\u2013490 nm) converts insoluble form of uncon-\njugated bilirubin to a water-soluble structural isomer known as lumirubin, in which the moieties involved in internal hydrogen bond formation are exposed. This forms the basis of phototherapy in Crigler-Najjar syndrome and other unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias.\n\u2022 The color changes that is observed in a bruise or a contusion is due \nto the pigments that predominate at different stages of healing.

Insulin and glucagon are two major hormones which control this integration. Insulin, the hormone of abundance, ensures that body conserves energy and proteins when food is readily available. Insulin increases glucose uptake in muscles and adipose tissues and the synthesis of glycogen, protein, and triacylglycerol. When food supplies are low, glucagon, along with catecholamines, ensures that a minimal level of blood glucose is available to carry out body functions. Glucagon increases glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and amino acid uptake (Chapter 27).\n Under the hormonal influences, different organs have different metabolic profile in fed and fasting states. The flow \nof intermediates through metabolic cycles is controlled by availability of substrates, allosteric regulation and covalent modification of enzymes as well as induction and repression of enzyme synthesis. Depending on availability, some organs can also change the metabolic fuel they use (Chapter 28).\n Diabetes mellitus is a condition when blood glucose is persistently elevated, either due to relative or absolute \ndeficiency of insulin. It is the leading cause of several diseases, including renal failure, nerve damage, heart attacks, and stroke. Diabetes can be classified into two groups, type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D), T1D being caused by absolute deficiency of insulin due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2 cells (Chapter 29).\n When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, excess body fat accumulates, causing obesity. It has a major \ninfluence on several health risks. Appetite is influenced by neural signals as well as circulating hormones such as leptin, and metabolites. Lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy and surgical procedure can help in weight management (Chapter 30).\n The primary healthcare physician must be aware that all metabolic pathways are interrelated. Excess carbohydrate \ncan be converted and stored as fat. During energy deficit, fat can be mobilized to provide acetyl CoA and ketone bodies for energy. Excessive ketone bodies, seen in diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation, can alter the blood pH, causing acidosis. Diabetes mellitus has several long-term complications and its early identification helps in reducing the morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a contributing factor to several health problems. Primary healthcare physician must know the assessment methods for obesity and its basic management.\n The importance of understanding the biochemical basis of these diseases can be understood by the fact that the \nGovernment of India launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, CVD and Stroke (NPCDCS) in October 2010. India is home to nearly 50 million people with diabetes and has 15% of the global disease burden. Atherosclerosis is another disease where integration of metabolism is to be understood. Atherosclerosis is one of the main reasons for myocardial infarction and stroke (Unit IV: Chapter 23). Obesity is an emerging health problem in India with more than 21% females and 19% males being obese.\n The flow of information is such that Unit VI must be read after Unit III on Carbohydrates. Further, appendix of Unit VI \ncan be considered as an extension of Unit III.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   434 24-10-2020   12:11:05"

            "Text": "27Metabolic Effects of \nInsulin and Glucagon\nI. OVERVIEW\nFour major tissues play a dominant role in fuel metabolism: liver, adipose, \nmuscle, and brain. These tissues contain unique sets of enzymes, such that each tissue is specialized for the storage, use, or generation of specific fuels. These tissues do not function in isolation but rather form part of a network in which one tissue may provide substrates to another or process compounds produced by other tissues. Communication between tissues is mediated by the nervous system, by the availability of circulating substrates, and by vari-ation in the levels of plasma hormones (\nFig. 27.1 ). The integration of energy \nmetabolism is controlled primarily by the actions of two peptide hormones, insulin and glucagon (secreted in response to changing substrate levels in the blood), with the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine (secreted in response to neural signals) playing a supporting role. Changes in the circulating levels of these hormones allow the body to store energy when food is abundant or to make stored energy available such as during survival crises (for example, famine, severe injury, and \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d situa-tions). This chapter describes the structure, secretion, and metabolic effects of the two hormones that most profoundly affect energy metabolism.\nII. INSULIN\nInsulin is a peptide hormone produced by the \u03b2 cells of the islets of \nLangerhans, which are clusters of cells embedded in the endocrine portion of the pancreas (\nFig. 27.2 ). [Note: \u201cInsulin\u201d is from the Latin for island.] The \nislets make up only about 1%\u20132% of the total cells of the pancreas. Insulin is the most important hormone coordinating the use of fuels by tissues. Its metabolic effects are anabolic, favoring, for example, synthesis of glycogen, triacylglycerol (TAG), and protein.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the structure and secretion of insulin and glucagon\n\u2022 Describe the metabolic effects of insulin and glucagon\u2022 Briefly describe the receptors and signal transduction of insulin and \nglucagon\n\u2022 Enumerate the clinical features and types of hypoglycemia\u2022 Describe the regulation of blood glucose level\nFigure 27.1\nMechanisms of communication between \nfour major tissues.LIVER\nMUSCLEADIPOSE\nBRAIN\nLIVER\nMUSC LE\nADIPOSE\nBRA IN\u2022 Hormones\n\u2022 Nervous system\n\u2022 Availability of \n   circulating substrates\nPancreas\nIslets of Langerhans\nb Cell\nFigure 27.2\nIslets of Langerhans.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   435 24-10-2020   12:11:06"

Structure\nInsulin is composed of 51 amino acids arranged in two polypeptide \nchains, designated A (21 amino acids) and B, which are linked together by two disulfide bonds (\nFig. 27.3A ). The insulin molecule also contains \nan intramolecular disulfide bond between amino acid residues of the A chain. [Note: Insulin was the first peptide for which the primary struc-ture was determined and the first therapeutic molecule made by recom-binant DNA technology (see p. 679).]\nB. Synthesis\nThe processing and transport of intermediates that occur during the synthesis of insulin are shown in \nFigures 27.3B  and 27.4. Biosynthesis \ninvolves production of two inactive precursors, preproinsulin (109 amino acids) and proinsulin (86 amino acids), which are sequentially cleaved to form the active hormone plus the connecting or C-peptide in a 1:1 ratio (see \nFig. 27.4 ). [Note: The C-peptide is essential for proper \ninsulin folding. Also, because its half-life in plasma is longer than that of insulin, the C-peptide level is a good indicator of insulin production and secretion.] Insulin is stored in cytosolic granules that, given the proper stimulus (see C.1. below), are released by exocytosis. (See p. 642 for a discussion of the synthesis of secreted proteins.) Insulin is degraded by insulin-degrading enzyme , which is present in the liver and, to a lesser \nextent, in the kidneys. Insulin has a plasma half-life of ~6 minutes. This short duration of action permits rapid changes in circulating levels of the hormone.\nC.

Increased secretion:  Insulin secretion by the pancreatic \u03b2 cells \nis closely coordinated with the secretion of glucagon by pancre-atic \u03b1 cells (\nFig. 27.5 ). The relative amounts of glucagon and insulin \nreleased are normally regulated such that the rate of hepatic glucose production is kept equal to the use of glucose by peripheral tissues. This maintains blood glucose between 70 and 140 mg/dl. In view of its coordinating role, it is not surprising that the \u03b2 cell responds \nto a variety of stimuli. In particular, insulin secretion is increased by glucose, amino acids, and gastrointestinal peptide hormones.\n a. Glucose:  Ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to a rise \nin blood glucose, the primary stimulus for insulin secretion (see \nFig. 27.5 ).

Like the liver, \u03b2 cells contain GLUT-2 trans-\nporters and express glucokinase  (hexokinase IV ; see p. 193). \nAt blood glucose levels >45 mg/dl, glucokinase  phosphorylates \nglucose in amounts proportional to the glucose concentration. Proportionality results from the lack of direct inhibition of gluco-\nkinase  by glucose 6-phosphate, its product. Additionally, the \nsigmoidal relationship between the velocity of the reaction and substrate concentration (see p. 193) maximizes the enzyme\u2019s responsiveness to changes in blood glucose level. Metabolism of glucose 6-phosphate generates ATP, leading to insulin secre-tion (see blue box below).\n b. Amino acids:  Ingestion of protein causes a transient rise in \nplasma amino acid levels (for example, arginine) that enhances the glucose-stimulated secretion of insulin. [Note: Fatty acids have a similar effect.]\n c. Gastrointestinal peptide hormones:  The intestinal peptides \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypep-tide ([GIP] also called glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide) increase the sensitivity of \u03b2 cells to glucose. They are released \nfrom the small intestine after the ingestion of food, causing an anticipatory rise in insulin levels and, thus, are referred to as incretins. Their action may account for the fact that the same amount of glucose given orally induces a much greater secre-tion of insulin than if given intravenously (IV).\nGlucose-dependent release of insulin into blood is medi-\nated through a rise in calcium (Ca2+) concentration in the \n\u03b2 cell. Glucose taken into \u03b2 cells by GLUT-2 is phosphory-\nlated and metabolized, with subsequent production of ATP . ATP-sensitive potassium (K\n+) channels close, causing depo-\nlarization of the plasma membrane, opening of voltage-gated Ca\n2+ channels, and influx of Ca2+ into the cell. Ca2+ \ncauses vesicles containing insulin to be exocytosed from the \u03b2 cell. Sulfonylureas, oral agents used to treat type 2 \ndiabetes, increase insulin secretion by closing ATP-sensitive K\n+ channels.\n 2. Decreased secretion:  The synthesis and release of insulin are \ndecreased when there is a scarcity of dietary fuels and also during periods of physiologic stress (for example, infection, hypoxia, and vigorous exercise), thereby preventing hypoglycemia. These effects are mediated primarily by the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine, which are made from tyrosine in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the adrenal medulla and then secreted. Secretion is largely controlled by neural signals. The catecholamines (primarily epinephrine) have a direct effect on energy metabolism, causing a rapid mobilization of energy-yielding fuels, including glucose from the liver (produced by glycogenolysis or gluconeogen-esis; see p. 219) and fatty acids (FA) from adipose tissue (produced by lipolysis; see p. 306). In addition, these biogenic amines can override the normal glucose-stimulated release of insulin. Thus, in emergency situations, the SNS largely replaces the plasma glucose concentration as the controlling influence over \u03b2-cell secretion. The \nregulation of insulin secretion is summarized in \nFigure 27.6 .6090\nMinutespg/ml\n0 60 120 180 240100110120\nGlucagon0mU/ml\n4080120\nInsulin80mg/100 ml100120\nGlucoseMeal\nFigure 27.5\nChanges in blood levels of glucose, \ninsulin, and glucagon after ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal.\nGlucoseEpinephrine\nAmino acids\nFatty acidsInsulinPrepro-\ninsulin\nInsulin\nInsulinto\nliver\nBLOOD\u03b2 CELL+\nFigure 27.6\nRegulation of insulin release from \npancreatic \u03b2 cells.

Effects on carbohydrate metabolism:  The effects of insulin on \nglucose metabolism promote its storage and are most prominent in three tissues: liver, muscle, and adipose. In liver and muscle, insulin increases glycogen synthesis. In muscle and adipose, insulin increases glucose uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporters (GLUT-4; see p. 192) in the cell membrane. Thus, the IV administration of insulin causes an immediate decrease in blood glucose level. In the liver, insulin decreases the production of glucose through the inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeo-genesis. [Note: The effects of insulin are due not just to changes in enzyme activity but also in enzyme amount insofar as insulin alters gene transcription.]\n 2. Effects on lipid metabolism:  A rise in insulin rapidly causes a signif-\nicant reduction in the release of FA from adipose tissue by inhib-iting the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase , a key enzyme of TAG \ndegradation in adipocytes. Insulin acts by promoting the dephos-phorylation and, hence, inactivation of the enzyme (see p. 307). Insulin also increases the transport and metabolism of glucose into adipocytes, providing the glycerol 3-phosphate substrate for TAG synthesis (see p. 305). Expression of the gene for lipoprotein \nlipase , which degrades TAG in circulating chylomicrons and very-\nlow-density lipoproteins ([VLDL], see p. 352), is increased by insulin in adipose, thereby providing FA for esterification to the glycerol. [Note: Insulin also promotes the conversion of glucose to TAG in the liver. The TAG are secreted in VLDL.]\n 3. Effects on protein synthesis:  In most tissues, insulin stimulates \nboth the entry of amino acids into cells and protein synthesis (trans-lation). [Note: Insulin stimulates protein synthesis through covalent activation of factors required for translation initiation.]\nE. Mechanism\nInsulin binds to specific, high-affinity receptors in the cell membrane of most tissues, including liver, muscle, and adipose. This is the first step in a cascade of reactions ultimately leading to a diverse array of biologic actions (\nFig. 27.7 ).\n 1.

The extracellular \u03b1 subunits contain the insulin-\nbinding site. A hydrophobic domain in each \u03b2 subunit spans the \nplasma membrane. The cytosolic domain of the \u03b2 subunit is a tyro-\nsine kinase , which is activated by insulin. As a result, the insulin \nreceptor is classified as a tyrosine kinase  receptor.\n 2. Signal transduction:  The binding of insulin to the \u03b1 subunits of \nthe insulin receptor induces conformational changes that are transmitted to the \u03b2 subunits. This promotes a rapid autophos-\nphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on each \u03b2 subunit (see \nFig. 27.7 ). Autophosphorylation initiates a cascade of cell-signaling \nresponses, including phosphorylation of a family of proteins called insulin receptor substrates (IRS). At least four IRS have been iden-tified that show similar structures but different tissue distributions. Phosphorylated IRS proteins interact with other signaling molecules through specific domains (known as SH2), activating a number of pathways that affect gene expression, cell metabolism, and growth. The actions of insulin are terminated by dephosphorylation of the receptor.\n 3. Membrane effects:  Glucose transport in some tissues, such as \nmuscle and adipose, increases in the presence of insulin (\nFig. 27.8 ). \nInsulin promotes movement of insulin-sensitive glucose trans-porters (GLUT-4) from a pool located in intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. [Note: Movement is the result of a signaling cascade in which an IRS binds to and activates a kinase  (phos-\nphoinositide 3-kinase ), leading to phosphorylation of the membrane \nphospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP\n2) to the \n3,4,5-trisphosphate form (PIP 3) that binds to and activates phos-\nphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 . This kinase , in turn, activates Akt \n(or protein kinase B ), resulting in GLUT-4 movement.] In contrast, \nother tissues have insulin-insensitive systems for glucose transport (\nFig. 27.9 ).

Receptor regulation:  Binding of insulin is followed by internaliza-\ntion of the hormone\u2013receptor complex. Once inside the cell, insulin is degraded in the lysosomes. The receptors may be degraded, but most are recycled to the cell surface. [Note: Elevated levels of insulin promote the degradation of receptors, thereby decreasing the number of surface receptors. This is one type of downregulation.]\n 5. Time course:  The binding of insulin provokes a wide range of actions. \nThe most immediate response is an increase in glucose transport into adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells that occurs within seconds of insulin binding to its membrane receptor. Insulin-induced changes in enzymic activity in many cell types occur over minutes to hours and reflect changes in the phosphorylation states of existing proteins. Insulin-induced increase in the amount of many enzymes, such as glucokinas e, liver pyruvate kinase , acetyl coen-\nzyme A  (CoA) carboxylase  (ACC ), and fatty acid synthase , requires \nhours to days. These changes reflect an increase in gene expres-sion through increased transcription (mediated by sterol regulatory element\u2013binding protein-1c; see p. 301) and translation.\nIII. GLUCAGON\nGlucagon is a peptide hormone secreted by the \u03b1 cells of the pancreatic \nislets of Langerhans. Glucagon, along with epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone (the counterregulatory hormones), opposes many of the actions of insulin (\nFig. 27.10 ). Most importantly, glucagon \nacts to maintain blood glucose levels by activation of hepatic glycoge-nolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon is composed of 29 amino acids arranged in a single polypeptide chain. [Note: Unlike insulin, the amino acid sequence of glucagon is the same in all mammalian species examined to date.] Glucagon is synthesized as a large precursor molecule (preproglu-cagon) that is converted to glucagon through a series of selective proteo-lytic cleavages, similar to those described for insulin biosynthesis (see \nFig. 27.3 ). In contrast to insulin, preproglucagon is processed to different \nproducts in different tissues, for example, GLP-1 in intestinal L cells. Like insulin, glucagon has a short half-life.\nA. Increased secretion\nThe \u03b1 cell is responsive to a variety of stimuli that signal actual or \npotential hypoglycemia ( Fig. 27.11 ). Specifically, glucagon secretion is \nincreased by low blood glucose, amino acids, and catecholamines.\n 1. Low blood glucose:  A decrease in plasma glucose concentration \nis the primary stimulus for glucagon release. During an overnight or prolonged fast, elevated glucagon levels prevent hypoglycemia (see Section IV below for a discussion of hypoglycemia).\n 2. Amino acids:  Amino acids (for example, arginine) derived from a meal \ncontaining protein stimulate the release of glucagon. The glucagon effectively prevents the hypoglycemia that would otherwise occur as a result of the increased insulin secretion that also occurs after a protein meal.Figure 27.10\nOpposing actions of insulin and \nglucagon plus epinephrine.Insulin Glucagon\nEpinephrineGlycogenolysis\nGluconeogenesisKetogenesisLipolysisGlycogenolysisGluconeogenesisKetogenesisLipolysis\nEpinephrine\nAmino acidsGlucagonPrecursors\nGlucagon\nGlucagon\u03b1 CELLS\nGlucose\nInsulinto\nliver\nBLOOD\n+\nFigure 27.11\nRegulation of glucagon release from \npancreatic \u03b1 cells.

Catecholamines:  Elevated levels of circulating epinephrine (from the \nadrenal medulla), norepinephrine (from sympathetic innervation of the pancreas), or both stimulate the release of glucagon. Thus, during periods of physiologic stress, the elevated catecholamine levels can override the effect on the \u03b1 cell of circulating substrates. In these situ-\nations, regardless of the concentration of blood glucose, glucagon levels are elevated in anticipation of increased glucose use. In contrast, insulin levels are depressed.\nB. Decreased secretion\nGlucagon secretion is significantly decreased by elevated blood glucose and by insulin. Both substances are increased following ingestion of glucose or a carbohydrate-rich meal (see \nFig. 27.5 ). The regulation of \nglucagon secretion is summarized in Figure 27.11 .\nC. Metabolic effects\nGlucagon is a catabolic hormone that promotes the maintenance of blood glucose levels. Its primary target is the liver.\n 1. Effects on carbohydrate metabolism:  The IV administration of \nglucagon leads to an immediate rise in blood glucose. This results from an increase in the degradation of liver glycogen and an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis.\n 2. Effects on lipid metabolism:  The primary effect of glucagon on \nlipid metabolism is inhibition of FA synthesis through phosphoryla-tion and subsequent inactivation of ACC  by adenosine monophos-\nphate  (AMP )\u2013activated protein kinase  (see p. 301). The resulting \ndecrease in malonyl CoA production removes the inhibition on long-chain FA \u03b2-oxidation (see p. 308). Glucagon also plays a role in \nlipolysis in adipocytes, but the major activators of hormone-sensi-\ntive lipase  (via phosphorylation by protein kinase A ) are the cate-\ncholamines. The free FA released are taken up by liver and oxidized to acetyl CoA, which is used in ketone body synthesis.\n 3. Effects on protein metabolism:  Glucagon increases uptake by the \nliver of amino acids supplied by muscle, resulting in increased avail-ability of carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis. As a consequence, plasma levels of amino acids are decreased.\nD. Mechanism\nGlucagon binds to high-affinity G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCR) on the cell membrane of hepatocytes. The GPCR for glucagon is distinct from the GPCR that bind epinephrine. [Note: Glucagon receptors are not found on skeletal muscle.] Glucagon binding results in activa-tion of adenylyl cyclase  in the plasma membrane (\nFig. 27.12 ; also see \np. 190). This causes a rise in cyclic AMP (cAMP), which, in turn, acti-vates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A  and increases the phosphory-\nlation of specific enzymes or other proteins. This cascade of increasing enzymic activities results in the phosphorylation-mediated activation or inhibition of key regulatory enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. An example of such a cascade in glycogen degradation is shown in Figure 16.9 on p. 232. [Note: Glucagon, like insulin, affects gene transcription. For example, glucagon induces expression of phos-\nphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  (see p. 222).]ATP\nMetabolic effects:Phospho-\ndiesterase\ncAMP-dependent \nprotein kinase\n(inactive)cAMP-dependent \nprotein kinase\n(active)\nEnzyme\n(dephosphorylated)Enzyme\n(phosphorylated)ADP\nH2O5\u00a2-AMP\n+Active\nadenylylcyclase\nATPGlucagon\nG protein\u2013coupledreceptor\ncAMP (  )\nCC\nCCR\nRCCGlucagon\nR\nR\nGlycogenolysis\nGluconeogenesis\nKetogenesis\nUptake of amino\nacids\nGlycogenesis, fatty\nacid synthesisProtein phosphataseP\nPi\nFatty acid oxidation\nFigure 27.12\nMechanism of action of glucagon. \n[Note: For clarity, G-protein activation of adenylyl cyclase  has been omitted.] \nR = regulatory subunit; C = catalytic subunit; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate; ADP = adenosine diphosphate; \nP = phosphate.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   442 24-10-2020   12:11:13"

HYPOGLYCEMIA\nHypoglycemia is characterized by 1) central nervous system (CNS) symp-toms, including confusion, aberrant behavior, or coma; 2) a simultaneous blood glucose level \u226450 mg/dl; and 3) symptoms being resolved within minutes following glucose administration (\nFig. 27.13 ). Hypoglycemia is \na medical emergency because the CNS has an absolute requirement for a continuous supply of bloodborne glucose to serve as a metabolic fuel. Transient hypoglycemia can cause cerebral dysfunction, whereas severe, prolonged hypoglycemia causes brain damage. Therefore, it is not surprising that the body has multiple overlapping mechanisms to prevent or correct hypoglycemia. The most important hormone changes in combating hypoglycemia are increased secretion of glucagon and the catecholamines, combined with decreased insulin secretion.\nA. Symptoms\nThe symptoms of hypoglycemia can be divided into two categories. Adrenergic (neurogenic, autonomic) symptoms, such as anxiety, palpi-tation, tremor, and sweating, are mediated by catecholamine release (primarily epinephrine) regulated by the hypothalamus in response to \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   443 24-10-2020   12:11:13"

The second category of hypoglycemic symptoms is neuroglycopenic. The impaired delivery of glucose to the brain (neuro-glycopenia) results in impairment of brain function, causing headache, confusion, slurred speech, seizures, coma, and death. Neuroglycopenic symptoms often result from a gradual decline in blood glucose, often to levels <50 mg/dl. The slow decline in glucose deprives the CNS of fuel but fails to trigger an adequate adrenergic response.\nB. Glucoregulatory systems\nHumans have two overlapping glucose-regulating systems that are activated by hypoglycemia: 1) the pancreatic \u03b1 cells, which release \nglucagon, and 2) receptors in the hypothalamus, which respond to abnormally low concentrations of blood glucose. The hypothalamic glucoreceptors can trigger both the secretion of catecholamines (medi-ated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system) and release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone by the anterior pituitary (see \nFig. 27.13 ). [Note: ACTH increases cortisol \nsynthesis and secretion in the adrenal cortex (see p. 361).] Glucagon, the catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone are sometimes called the counterregulatory hormones because each opposes the action of insulin on glucose use.\n 1. Glucagon and epinephrine:  Secretion of these counterregulatory \nhormones is most important in the acute, short-term regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. It inhibits insulin secretion, thereby preventing GLUT-4\u2013mediated uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Epinephrine assumes a critical role in hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient, for example, in the late stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see p. 472). The prevention or correction of hypo-glycemia fails when the secretion of both glucagon and epinephrine is deficient.\n 2. Cortisol and growth hormone:  These counterregulatory hormones \nare less important in the short-term maintenance of blood glucose concentrations. They do, however, play a role in the long-term (tran-scriptional) management of glucose metabolism.\nC. Types\nHypoglycemia may be divided into four types: 1) insulin induced, 2) postprandial (sometimes called reactive hypoglycemia), 3) fasting hypoglycemia, and 4) alcohol related.\n 1. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia:  Hypoglycemia occurs frequently in \npatients with diabetes who are receiving insulin treatment, particu-larly those striving to achieve tight control of blood glucose levels. Mild hypoglycemia in fully conscious patients is treated by oral administration of carbohydrate. Unconscious patients are typically given glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly (\nFig. 27.14 ).012 34 5 678080160240\nSaline\nSalineHours\n40\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n 7\n8\nSaline\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n66\nSaline\nHours\n1Patients with type 1\ndiabetes were injected with insulin.\nj\n2AAfter several hours, \nsome patients werealso treated with subcutaneous glucagon.     \nSome patients were\ntreated with saline instead of glucagon.\n3Glucagon increasesblood glucose bymobilizing liver glycogen and stimulating hepaticgluconeogenesis.

It is caused by an exaggerated insulin release following a meal, prompting transient hypoglycemia with mild adren-ergic symptoms. The plasma glucose level returns to normal even if the patient is not fed. The only treatment usually required is that the patient eats frequent small meals rather than the usual three large meals.\n 3. Fasting hypoglycemia:  Low blood glucose during fasting is rare \nbut is more likely to present as a serious medical problem. Fasting hypoglycemia, which tends to produce neuroglycopenic symp-toms, may result from a reduction in the rate of glucose produc-tion by hepatic glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Thus, low blood glucose levels are often seen in patients with hepatocellular damage or adrenal insufficiency or in fasting individuals who have consumed large quantities of ethanol (see 4. below). Alternately, fasting hypo-glycemia may be the result of an increased rate of glucose use by the peripheral tissues because of overproduction of insulin by rare pancreatic tumors. If left untreated, a patient with fasting hypogly-cemia may lose consciousness and experience convulsions and coma. [Note: Certain inborn errors of metabolism, for example, defects in FA oxidation, result in fasting hypoglycemia.]\n 4. Alcohol-related hypoglycemia:  Alcohol (ethanol) is metabo-\nlized in the liver by two oxidation reactions (\nFig. 27.15 ). Ethanol is \nfirst converted to acetaldehyde by zinc-containing alcohol dehy-\ndrogenase . Acetaldehyde is subsequently oxidized to acetate by \naldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH ).

Metabolic Effects of Insulin and Glucagon\nhyperventilation, and nausea.] In each reaction, electrons are \ntransferred to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), \nresulting in an increase in the ratio of the reduced form (NADH) to NAD\n+. The abundance of NADH favors the reduction of pyruvate to \nlactate and of oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate. Recall from p. 118 that pyruvate and OAA are substrates in the synthesis of glucose. Thus, the ethanol-mediated increase in NADH causes these gluconeo-genic precursors to be diverted into alternate pathways, resulting in the decreased synthesis of glucose. This can precipitate hypo-glycemia, particularly in individuals who have depleted their stores of liver glycogen. [Note: Decreased availability of OAA allows acetyl CoA to be diverted to ketone body synthesis in the liver (see p. 313) and can result in alcoholic ketosis that may result in ketoacidosis.] Hypoglycemia can produce many of the behaviors associated with alcohol intoxication, such as agitation, impaired judgment, and combativeness. Therefore, alcohol consumption in vulnerable indi-viduals (such as those who are fasted or have engaged in prolonged, strenuous exercise) can produce hypoglycemia that may contribute to the behavioral effects of alcohol. Because alcohol consump-tion can also increase the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin, those in an intensive insulin treatment protocol (see p. 472) are counseled about the increased risk of hypoglycemia that gener-ally occurs many hours after alcohol ingestion.\nChronic alcohol consumption can also result in alcoholic fatty \nliver because of increased hepatic synthesis of TAG coupled with impaired formation or release of VLDL. This occurs as a result of decreased FA oxidation because of a fall in the NAD\n+/NADH ratio and increased lipogenesis because of the \nincreased availability of FA (decreased catabolism) and of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (the dehydrogenase  is inhibited \nby the low NAD\n+/NADH ratio; see p. 197). With continued \nalcohol consumption, alcoholic fatty liver can progress first to alcoholic hepatitis and then to alcoholic cirrhosis.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   446 24-10-2020   12:11:15"

Chapter Summary\nThe integration of energy metabolism  is controlled primarily by insulin  and the opposing actions of glucagon  and the \ncatecholamines, particularly epinephrine  (Fig. 27.16 ). Changes in the circulating levels of these hormones allow the body \nto store energy when food is abundant or to make stored energy available in times of physiologic stress  (for example, \nduring survival crises, such as famine). Insulin  is a peptide hormone produced by the \u03b2 cells  of the islets of Langerhans  \nof the pancreas . It consists of disulfide-linked A and B chains. A rise in blood glucose is the most important signal for \ninsulin secretion . The catecholamines , secreted in response to stress, trauma, or extreme exercise, inhibit insulin secre-\ntion. Insulin increases glucose uptake (by glucose transporters ( GLUT-4 ) in muscle and adipose tissue) and the synthesis \nof glycogen , protein , and triacylglycerol : It is an anabolic  hormone. These actions are mediated by binding to its \nmembrane tyrosine kinase  receptor . Binding initiates a cascade of cell-signaling responses, including phosphorylation \nof a family of proteins called insulin receptor substrate proteins . Glucagon  is a monomeric peptide hormone produced \nby the \u03b1 cells  of the pancreatic islets (both insulin and glucagon synthesis involve formation of inactive precursors that are \ncleaved to form the active hormones). Glucagon, along with epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone (the counterregulatory hormones ), opposes many of the actions of insulin. Glucagon acts to maintain blood glucose \nduring periods of potential hypoglycemia. Glucagon increases glycogenolysis , gluconeogenesis , fatty acid oxidation , \nketogenesis , and amino acid uptake : It is a catabolic  hormone. Glucagon secretion is stimulated by low blood glucose, \namino acids, and the catecholamines. Its secretion is inhibited by elevated blood glucose and by insulin. Glucagon binds to high-affinity G protein \u2013coupled receptors  on the cell membrane of hepatocytes. Binding results in the activation of \nadenylyl cyclase , which produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP ). Subsequent acti-\nvation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A  results in the phosphorylation -mediated activation or inhibition of key \nregulatory enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Both insulin and glucagon affect gene transcrip-\ntion. Hypoglycemia  is characterized by low blood glucose accompanied by adrenergic  and neuroglycopenic symp-\ntoms  that are rapidly resolved by the administration of glucose. Insulin-induced, postprandial, and fasting hypoglycemia \nresult in release of glucagon and epinephrine. The rise in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  (NADH ) that accompa-\nnies ethanol  metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia in individuals with depleted stores. Alcohol \nconsumption also increases the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver disease .V. Medical Perspectives\nInsulin is secreted from the pancreas in a biphasic manner, a short-lasting rapid-release phase 1 and a sustained-release \nphase 2. Interestingly, in type II diabetes mellitus, selective loss of first phase secretion precedes other manifestations of the disease.\nInsulinomas are rare tumors of beta cells of pancreas, which secrete insulin unregulated by glucose levels. Patients have \nsymptoms of hypoglycemia. Blood assays show low glucose and elevated insulin and C-peptide levels. Most of the insu-linomas are benign.\nGlucagonomas are tumors of alpha cells of pancreas, which secrete glucagon. A large proportion of glucagonomas are \nmalignant.\nInsulin prepared by recombinant DNA technology is used by diabetic patients. Human insulin can be short acting (regular) \nor intermediate acting (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn, NPH). Action of short-acting insulin starts about 30 minutes after injecting, peak occurring between 2 and 3 hours and the duration is up to 10 hours. Effect of intermediate-acting insulin starts 2\u20134 hours after injection, peaks between 4 and 10 hours and lasts up to 18 hours. Mixtures of these are prescribed for maintaining daylong glucose control.\nOral medicines, which lower blood glucose levels by several mechanisms are also available. Alpha-glucosidase inhib-\nitors (acarbose, miglitol) are drugs which lower blood sugar levels by blocking the breakdown of starches. Biguanides (metformin) act primarily by decreasing the hepatic output of glucose. Sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, meglitinide and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are other antihyperglycemic \ndrugs. As C-peptide is secreted in equimolar concentration to insulin, its serum levels can be used to assess pancreatic beta cell function. Its levels reduce in type 1 diabetes mellitus and exogenous insulin administration.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   447 24-10-2020   12:11:15"

The constant production of glucagon would result in constant gluconeogenesis, using amino acids from proteolysis as substrates. This results in loss of body weight.27.5.

The oxidation of ethanol to acetate \nby dehydrogenases is accompanied by the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\n+) to NADH. The \nrise in the NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate and \noxaloacetate (OAA) to malate, decreasing the availability of substrates for gluconeogenesis and resulting in hypogly-cemia. The rise in NADH also reduces the NAD\n+ needed \nfor fatty acid (FA) oxidation. The decrease in OAA shunts any acetyl coenzyme A produced to ketogenesis. Note that the inhibition of FA degradation results in their reester-ification into triacylglycerol that can result in fatty liver.27.3.

As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399).

Insulinomas are characterized by \nconstant production of insulin (and, therefore, of C-peptide) by the tumor cells. The increase in insulin drives glucose uptake by tissues such as muscle and adipose that have insulin-dependent glucose transporters, resulting in hypo-glycemia. However, the hypoglycemia is insufficient to suppress insulin production and secretion. Insulinomas, then, are characterized by increased blood insulin and decreased blood glucose. Insulin, as an anabolic hormone, results in weight gain.27.4.

During this interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and triacylglycerols (TAG) occur, the latter primarily as compo-nents of chylomicrons synthesized and secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells (see p. 351). Islet tissue of the pancreas responds to the elevated level of glucose with increased secretion of insulin and decreased secretion of glucagon. The elevated insulin/glucagon ratio and the ready availability of circulating substrates make the absorptive state an anabolic period charac-terized by increased synthesis of TAG and glycogen to replenish fuel stores as well as increased synthesis of protein. During this absorptive period, virtually all tissues use glucose as a fuel, and the metabolic response of the body is dominated by alterations in the metabolism of liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain. In this chapter, an \u201corgan map\u201d is introduced that traces the movement of metabolites between tissues. The goal is to create an expanded and clinically useful vision of whole-body metabolism.\nII. REGULATORY MECHANISMS\nThe flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric regulation of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis, primarily through regulation of transcription. Although this scheme may at first seem redundant, each mechanism operates on a different timescale (\nFig. 28.1 ) and allows the body to adapt to a wide \nvariety of physiologic situations. In the absorptive state, these regulatory mechanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen, TAG, and protein.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the metabolism in liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and \nbrain in fed state\n\u2022 Describe the metabolism in kidney, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and \nbrain in fasting state\nAvailability of\nsubstrates\n0\n20\n304050 10\nminutes\nAllosteric activators\nand inhibitors\n0\n20\n304050 10\nminutes\nCovalent modification\nof enzymes\n121\n2\n3\n4\n567891011\nminutes to\nhours \nSynthesis of new\nenzyme molecules\nhours to days \nFigure 28.1\nControl mechanisms of metabolism and \nsome typical response times.

For \nexample, glycolysis in the liver is stimulated following a meal by an increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of phos-\nphofructokinase-1  ([PFK-1 ], see p. 195). In contrast, gluconeogenesis is \ndecreased by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric inhibitor of fruc-\ntose 1,6-bisphosphatase  (see p. 222).\nB. Covalent modification\nThe activity of many enzymes is regulated by the addition (via kinases , \nsuch as cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]\u2013dependent protein \nkinase A  [PKA] and adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase  \n[AMPK ]) or removal (via phosphatases ) of phosphate groups from \nspecific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues of the protein. In \nthe absorptive state, most of the covalently regulated enzymes are in the dephosphorylated form and are active (\nFig. 28.2 ). \nThree exceptions are glycogen phosphorylase kinase  (see \np. 233), glycogen phosphorylase  (see p. 233), and hormone-\nsensitive lipase  (HSL) (see p. 306), which are inactive in their \ndephosphorylated form. [Note: In the liver, the phosphatase  \ndomain of bifunctional phosphofructokinase-2  (PFK-2 ) is inac-\ntive when the protein is dephosphorylated (see p. 196).]\nC. Induction and repression of enzyme synthesis\nIncreased (induction of) or decreased (repression of) enzyme synthesis leads to changes in the number of enzyme mole-cules, rather than changing the activity of existing enzyme molecules. Enzymes subject to synthesis regulation are often those that are needed under specific physiologic conditions. For example, in the well-fed state, elevated insulin levels result in an increase in the synthesis of key enzymes, such as acetyl \ncoenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase  (ACC ) and fatty acid synthase  \n(see p. 441), involved in anabolic metabolism. In the fasted state, glucagon induces expression of phosphoenolpyru-\nvate carboxykinase  (PEPCK ) of gluconeogenesis (see p. 442). \n[Note: Both hormones affect gene transcription.]\nIII. LIVER: NUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION CENTER\nThe liver is uniquely situated to process and distribute dietary nutrients because the venous drainage of the gut and pancreas passes through the hepatic portal vein before entry into the general circulation. Thus, after a meal, the liver is bathed in blood containing absorbed nutrients and elevated levels of insulin secreted by the pancreas. During the absorp-tive period, the liver takes up carbohydrates, lipids, and most amino acids. These nutrients are then metabolized, stored, or routed to other tissues. In this way, the liver smooths out potentially broad fluctuations in the avail-ability of nutrients for the peripheral tissues.\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\nThe liver is normally a glucose-producing rather than a glucose-using organ. However, after a meal containing carbohydrate, the liver becomes Figure 28.2\nImportant reactions of intermediary metabolism regulated by enzyme phosphorylation. \nBlue text  = intermediates of \ncarbohydrate metabolism; brown text  \n= intermediates of lipid metabolism; P = phosphate; CoA = coenzyme A; CO\n2 = carbon dioxide.Glycogen\nGlucose 1-P\nGlucose 6-P Glucose \nFructose 6-P\nFructose 1,6-bis-P\nGlyceraldehyde 3-P\n1,3-bis-Phosphoglycerate\n3-Phosphoglycerate\n2-Phosphoglycerate\nPhosphoenolpyruvate\nPyruvateDihydroxyacetone-P\nGlycerol-P Glycerol\nTriacyl-\nglycerol\nFatty acyl CoA Fatty acids\nMalonyl CoA CO2\nCitrate\nIsocitrate\n\u03b1-Ketoglutarate\nSuccinyl CoA SuccinateLactate\nOxaloacetate\nMalate\nFumarateCO2\nCO2CO2\nAcetyl CoAGlycogen\nphosphorylase kinase\nGlycogen \nphosphorylaseGlycogen \nsynthase\nAcetyl CoA carboxylasePyruvate\nkinase(hepatic)Fructose \nbisphosphate phosphatase-2 domain (hepatic) \nHormone-\nsensitive lipaseUDP-Glucose\nFructose 2,6-PEnzymes that are \ninactive in their dephosphorylated stateEnzymes that are \nactive in their dephosphorylated state\nPyruvate\ndehydrog-\nenasePhosphofructokinase-2 \ndomain (hepatic)\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   452 24-10-2020   12:11:17"

This increased use reflects increased glucose uptake by the hepatocytes. Their insulin-independent glucose transporter (GLUT-2) has a low affinity (high K\nm [Michaelis constant]) for \nglucose and, therefore, takes up glucose only when blood glucose is high (see p. 193). Processes that are upregulated when hepatic glucose is increased include the following.\n 1. Increased glucose phosphorylation:  The elevated levels of glucose \nwithin the hepatocyte (as a result of elevated extracellular levels) allow glucokinase  to phosphorylate glucose to glucose 6-phosphate \n(\nFig. 28.3 , 1). [Note: Glucokinase  has a high K m for glucose, is not \nsubject to direct product inhibition, and has a sigmoidal reaction curve (see p. 193).]\n 2. Increased glycogenesis:  The conversion of glucose 6-phosphate \nto glycogen is favored by the activation of glycogen synthase , \nboth by dephosphorylation and by increased availability of glucose 6-phosphate, its positive allosteric effector (see \nFig. 28.3 , 2).\n 3. Increased pentose phosphate pathway activity:  The increased \navailability of glucose 6-phosphate, combined with the active use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in hepatic lipogenesis, stimulates the pentose phosphate pathway (see p. 250). This pathway typically accounts for 5%\u201310% of the glucose metab-olized by the liver (see \nFig. 28.3 , 3).\n 4. Increased glycolysis:  In the liver, glycolysis is significant only \nduring the absorptive period following a carbohydrate-rich meal.

The Feed\u2013Fast Cycle \ninsulin/glucagon ratio that results in increased amounts of the regu-\nlated enzymes of glycolysis: glucokinase , PFK-1 , and pyruvate kinase  \n([PK], see p. 201). Additionally, PFK-1  is allosterically activated by \nfructose 2,6-bisphosphate generated by the active (dephosphory-lated) kinase  domain of bifunctional PFK-2 . PK is dephosphorylated \nand active. Pyruvate dehydrogenase  (PDH), which converts pyru-\nvate to acetyl CoA, is active (dephosphorylated) because pyruvate inhibits PDH kinase  (see \nFig. 28.3 , 4). The acetyl CoA either is used \nas a substrate for fatty acid (FA) synthesis or is oxidized for energy in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. (See\n Fig. 28.4  for the central \nrole of glucose 6-phosphate.)\n 5. Decreased glucose production:  While glycolysis and glycogen-\nesis (pathways that promote glucose storage) are being stimulated in the liver in the absorptive state, gluconeogenesis and glycogenol-ysis (pathways that generate glucose) are being inhibited. Pyruvate \ncarboxylase  (PC), which catalyzes the first step in gluconeogenesis, \nis largely inactive because of low levels of acetyl CoA, its allosteric activator (see p. 218). [Note: The acetyl CoA is being used for FA synthesis.] The high insulin/glucagon ratio also favors inactivation of other gluconeogenic enzymes such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase  \n(see Fig. 13.17, p. 196). Glycogenolysis is inhibited by dephosphor-ylation of glycogen phosphorylase  and phosphorylase kinase . [Note: \nThe increased uptake and decreased production of blood glucose in the absorptive period prevents hyperglycemia.]\nB. Fat metabolism\n 1. Increased fatty acid synthesis:  Liver is the primary site of de novo \nsynthesis of FA (see Fig. 28.3 , 5). FA synthesis, a cytosolic process, \nis favored in the absorptive period by availability of the substrates acetyl CoA (from glucose and amino acid metabolism) and NADPH (from glucose metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway) and by the activation of ACC , both by dephosphorylation and by the \npresence of its allosteric activator, citrate. [Note: Inactivity of AMPK  \nfavors dephosphorylation.] ACC  catalyzes the formation of malonyl \nCoA from acetyl CoA, the rate-limiting reaction for FA synthesis (see p. 300). [Note: Malonyl CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I  \n(CPT-I ) of FA oxidation (see p. 308). Thus, citrate directly activates \nFA synthesis and indirectly inhibits FA degradation.]\n a. Source of cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A:  Pyruvate from aerobic \nglycolysis enters mitochondria and is decarboxylated by PDH. \nThe acetyl CoA product is combined with oxaloacetate (OAA) to form citrate via citrate synthase  of the TCA cycle. Citrate leaves \nthe mitochondria (as a result of the inhibition of isocitrate dehy-\ndrogenase  by ATP) and enters the cytosol. Citrate is cleaved by \nATP citrate lyase  (induced by insulin), producing the acetyl CoA \nsubstrate of ACC  plus OAA.\n b. Additional source of NADPH:  The OAA is reduced to malate, \nwhich is oxidatively decarboxylated to pyruvate by malic enzyme  \nas NADPH is formed (see Fig. 21.11, p. 304).\n 2.

Glycerol \n3-phosphate, the backbone for TAG synthesis, is provided by glycolysis (see p. 306). The liver packages these endogenous TAG into very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles that are secreted into the blood for use by extrahepatic tissues, particularly adipose and muscle tissues (see \nFig. 28.3 , 6).\nC. Amino acid metabolism\n 1. Increased amino acid degradation:  In the absorptive period, more \namino acids are present than the liver can use in the synthesis of proteins and other nitrogen-containing molecules. The surplus amino acids are not stored but are either released into the blood for other tissues to use in protein synthesis or deaminated, with the resulting carbon skeletons being degraded by the liver to pyruvate, acetyl CoA, or TCA cycle intermediates. These metabolites can be oxidized for energy or used in FA synthesis (see \nFig. 28.3 , 7). The liver has limited \ncapacity to initiate degradation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They pass through the liver essentially unchanged and are metabolized in muscle (see p. 401).\n 2. Increased protein synthesis:  The body does not store protein for \nenergy in the same way that it maintains glycogen or TAG reserves. However, a transient increase in the synthesis of hepatic proteins does occur in the absorptive state, resulting in replacement of any proteins that may have been degraded during the previous period of fasting (see \nFig. 28.3 , 8).\nIV. ADIPOSE TISSUE: ENERGY STORAGE DEPOT\nAdipose tissue is second only to the liver in its ability to distribute fuel mole-cules. In a 70-kg man, white adipose tissue (WAT) weighs ~14 kg, or about half as much as the total muscle mass. Nearly the entire volume of each adipocyte in WAT can be occupied by a droplet of anhydrous, calorically dense TAG (\nFig. 28.5 ).\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\n 1. Increased glucose transport:  Circulating insulin levels are elevated \nin the absorptive state, resulting in an influx of glucose into adipo-cytes via insulin-sensitive GLUT-4 recruited to the cell surface from intracellular vesicles (\nFig. 28.6 , 1). The glucose is phosphorylated by \nhexokinase .\n 2. Increased glycolysis:  The increased intracellular availability of \nglucose results in an enhanced rate of glycolysis (see Fig. 28.6 , 2). \nIn adipose tissue, glycolysis serves a synthetic function by supplying glycerol 3-phosphate for TAG synthesis (see p. 305). [Note: Adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase .]\n 3. Increased pentose phosphate pathway activity:  Adipose tissue \ncan metabolize glucose by means of the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby producing NADPH, which is essential for FA synthesis (see p. 306 and \nFig. 28.6 , 3). However, in humans, de novo synthesis is \nnot a major source of FA in adipose tissue, except when refeeding a previously fasted individual (see \nFig. 28.6 , 4).VLDL\n(from liver)Acetyl CoA\nTCA\ncycleADIPOCYTEGlucose\nGlucose Glucose 6-P\nPyruvate NADPH\nFatty acid\nChylomicrons \n(from gut)\nChylomicron\nremnants\n(to liver)23 2\n64\nADADIADIDIPOPOCPOCCYTETEYTE\nse\nAdipocytes contain the \ninsulin-sensitive GLUT-4.\n551\nVLDL\n(from liver)\nChylomicrons \n(from gut)\nChylomicron\nremnants\n(to liver )\n5\nFat stored in adipose tissue is derived \nfrom dietary fatty acids packaged as TAG in chylomicrons and endogenous fatty acids made in the liver and packaged as TAG in VLDL.

Fat metabolism\nMost of the FA added to the TAG stores of adipocytes after consump-\ntion of a lipid-containing meal are provided by the degradation of exogenous (dietary) TAG in chylomicrons sent out by the intestine and endogenous TAG in VLDL sent out by the liver (see \nFig. 28.6 , 5). The FA \nare released from the lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase  (LPL), an extra-\ncellular enzyme attached to the endothelial cells of capillary walls in many tissues, particularly adipose and muscle (see p. 351). In adipose tissue, LPL is upregulated by insulin. Thus, in the fed state, elevated \nlevels of glucose and insulin favor storage of TAG (see \nFig. 28.6 , 6), all \nthe carbons of which are supplied by glucose. [Note: Elevated insulin favors the dephosphorylated (inactive) form of HSL (see p. 306), thereby \ninhibiting lipolysis in the well-fed state.]\nV. RESTING SKELETAL MUSCLE\nSkeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of the body mass in individuals of healthy weight, and it can use glucose, amino acids, FA, and ketone bodies as fuel. In the well-fed state, muscle takes up glucose via GLUT-4 (for energy and glycogen synthesis) and amino acids (for energy and protein synthesis). In contrast to liver, there is no covalent regulation of PFK-2  in \nskeletal muscle. However, in the cardiac isozyme, the kinase  domain is \nactivated by epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation (see p. 196).\nSkeletal muscle is unique in being able to respond to substan-\ntial changes in the demand for ATP that accompanies contrac-tion. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O\n2) \nconsumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%. This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue.\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\n 1. Increased glucose transport:  The transient increase in plasma \nglucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 192 and \nFig. 28.7 , 1), thereby reducing blood \nglucose. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase  and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes.\n 2. Increased glycogenesis:  The increased insulin/glucagon ratio and \nthe availability of glucose 6-phosphate favor glycogen synthesis, particularly if glycogen stores have been depleted as a result of exercise (see p. 227 and \nFig. 28.7 , 2).\nB. Fat metabolism\nFA are released from chylomicrons and VLDL by the action of LPL (see \npp. 351 and 354). However, FA are of secondary importance as a fuel for resting muscle during the well-fed state, in which glucose is the primary source of energy.Amino\nacids(includingBCAA)\nAmino\nacids\nProtein\nMUSCLE\nM\nM\nM\nM\nMU\nU\nU\nUS\nS\nSC\nC\nC\nCL\nLE\nE\nMuscle contains \ninsulin-sensitive GLUT-4.Glucose 6-P Glycogen\nGlucose\nGlucose123\nino\nds\ncludin g\nAA)\nn\nno\ni\ni\ni\nin\nin\nino\nino\nino\nino\nino\nino\nno\nno\nno\nno\no\noo\ns\nss\ns\nds\nds\ndss\ndss\ndss\ndss\ndss\ndss\ndss\nd\nd\nd\nds\nds\n3Any tissue proteins\ndegraded during the postabsorptive period are resynthesized.\nAcetyl CoA\nPyruvateTCA\ncycle\nFigure 28.7\nMajor metabolic pathways in skeletal \nmuscle in the absorptive state.

Increased protein synthesis:  An increase in amino acid uptake \nand protein synthesis occurs in the absorptive period after ingestion of a meal containing protein (see \nFig. 28.7 , 3 and 4). This synthesis \nreplaces protein degraded since the previous meal.\n 2. Increased branched-chain amino acid uptake:  Muscle is the \nprincipal site for degradation of the BCAA because it contains the required transaminase  (see p. 401). The dietary BCAA escape \nmetabolism by the liver and are taken up by muscle, where they are used for protein synthesis (see \nFig. 28.7 , 3) and as energy sources.\nVI. BRAIN\nAlthough contributing only 2% of the adult weight, the brain accounts for a consistent 20% of the basal O\n2 consumption of the body at rest. Because \nthe brain is vital to the proper functioning of all organs of the body, special priority is given to its fuel needs. To provide energy, substrates must be able to cross the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in the brain (the blood\u2013brain barrier [BBB]). In the fed state, the brain exclusively uses glucose as a fuel (GLUT-1 of the BBB is insulin independent), completely oxidizing ~140 g/day to carbon dioxide and water. Because the brain contains no significant stores of glycogen, it is completely dependent on the availability of blood glucose (\nFig. 28.8 , 1). [Note: If blood glucose levels \nfall to <50 mg/dl (normal fasted blood glucose is 70\u201399 mg/dl), cerebral function is impaired (see p. 443).] The brain also lacks significant stores of TAG, and the FA circulating in the blood make little contribution to energy production for reasons that are unclear. The intertissue exchanges charac-teristic of the absorptive period are summarized in \nFigure 28.9 .\nVII. OVERVIEW OF THE FASTED STATE\nFasting begins if no food is ingested after the absorptive period. It may result from an inability to obtain food, the desire to lose weight rapidly, or clinical situations in which an individual cannot eat (for example, because of trauma, surgery, cancer, or burns). In the absence of food, plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio and the decreased availability of circulating substrates make the postabsorptive period of nutrient deprivation a catabolic period characterized by degra-dation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need to maintain adequate plasma levels of glucose to sustain energy metabolism in the brain, red blood cells, and other glucose-requiring tissues and 2) the need to mobilize FA from TAG in WAT for the synthesis and release of ketone bodies by the liver to supply energy to other tissues and spare body protein. As a result, blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range in fasting, while FA and ketone body levels increase.

            "Text": "VIII. Liver in Fasting 459\nB. Enzymic changes\nIn fasting (as in the well-fed state), the flow of intermediates through the \npathways of energy metabolism is controlled by four mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric regulation of enzymes, 3) cova-lent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. The metabolic changes observed in fasting are generally opposite those described for the absorptive state (see \nFig. 28.9 ). For \nexample, although most of the enzymes regulated by covalent modifi-cation are dephosphorylated and active in the well-fed state, they are phosphorylated and inactive in the fasted state. Three exceptions are glycogen phosphorylase  (see p. 233), glycogen phosphorylase kinase  \n(see p. 233), and HSL (see p. 306), which are active in their phosphor-\nylated states. In fasting, substrates are not provided by the diet but are available from the breakdown of stores and/or tissues, such as glyco-genolysis with release of glucose from the liver, lipolysis with release of FA and glycerol from TAG in adipose tissue, and proteolysis with release of amino acids from muscle. Recognition that the changes in fasting are the reciprocal of those in the fed state is helpful in under-standing the ebb and flow of metabolism.\nVIII. LIVER IN FASTING\nThe primary role of the liver in fasting is maintenance of blood glucose through the production of glucose (from glycogenolysis and gluconeogen-esis) for glucose-requiring tissues and the synthesis and distribution of ketone bodies for use by other tissues. Therefore, hepatic metabolism is distinguished from peripheral (or extrahepatic) metabolism.\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\nThe liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase  in the liver allows the \nproduction of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and from gluco-neogenesis (see \nFig. 28.4 ).]\n 1. Increased glycogenolysis:  Figure 28.11 shows the sources of blood \nglucose after ingestion of 100 g of glucose. During the brief absorp-tive period, ingested glucose is the major source of blood glucose. Several hours later, blood glucose levels have declined sufficiently to cause increased secretion of glucagon and decreased secretion of insulin. The increased glucagon/insulin ratio causes a rapid mobi-lization of liver glycogen stores (which contain ~80 g of glycogen in the fed state) because of PKA-mediated phosphorylation (and acti-\nvation) of glycogen phosphorylase kinase  that phosphorylates (and \nactivates) glycogen phosphorylase  (see p. 233). \nFigure 28.11  shows \nthat because liver glycogen is exhausted by 24 hours of fasting, hepatic glycogenolysis is a transient response to early fasting. \nFigure 28.12 , 1, shows glycogen degradation as part of the overall \nmetabolic response of the liver during fasting. [Note: Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase  simultaneously inhibits glycogenesis.]\n 2. Increased gluconeogenesis:  The synthesis of glucose and its \nrelease into the circulation are vital hepatic functions during short- and long-term fasting (see \nFig. 28.12 , 2). The carbon skeletons Figure 28.10\nMetabolic fuels present in a 70-kg man at the beginning of a fast.

Gluconeogenesis, favored by activation of fructose 1,6-bispho-\nsphatase  (because of decreased availability of its inhibitor fruc-\ntose 2,6-bisphosphate; see p. 219) and by induction of PEPCK  by \nglucagon (see p. 222), begins 4\u20136 hours after the last meal and becomes fully active as stores of liver glycogen are depleted (see \nFig. 28.11 ). [Note: The decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate simul-\ntaneously inhibits glycolysis at PFK-1  (see p. 195).]\nB. Fat metabolism\n 1. Increased fatty acid oxidation:  The oxidation of FA obtained from \nTAG hydrolysis in adipose tissue is the major source of energy in hepatic tissue in the fasted state (see \nFig. 28.12 , 3). The fall in \nmalonyl CoA because of phosphorylation (inactivation) of ACC  by \nAMPK  removes the brake on CPT-I , allowing \u03b2-oxidation to occur \n(see p. 308). FA oxidation generates NADH, flavin adenine dinucle-otide (FADH\n2), and acetyl CoA. The NADH inhibits the TCA cycle \nand shifts OAA to malate. This results in acetyl CoA being avail-able for ketogenesis. The acetyl CoA is also an allosteric activator of PC and an allosteric inhibitor of PDH, thereby favoring use of \npyruvate in gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 15.9, p. 222). [Note: Acetyl CoA cannot be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, in part because the PDH reaction is irreversible.] Oxidation of NADH and \nFADH\n2 coupled with oxidative phosphorylation supplies the energy \nrequired by the PC and PEPCK  reactions of gluconeogenesis.\n 2. Increased ketogenesis:  The liver is unique in being able to synthe-\nsize and release ketone bodies, primarily 3-hydroxybutyrate but also acetoacetate, for use as fuel by peripheral tissues but not by the liver itself because liver lacks thiophorase  (see p. 315).

[Note: Ketogenesis releases CoA, insuring its availability for continued FA oxidation.] The availability of circulating water-soluble ketone bodies is impor-tant in fasting because they can be used for fuel by most tissues, including the brain, once their blood level is high enough. Ketone body concentration in blood increases from ~50 \u03bcM to ~6 mM in \nfasting. This reduces the need for gluconeogenesis from amino acid carbon skeletons, thus preserving essential protein (see\n Fig. 28.11 ). \nKetogenesis as part of the overall hepatic response to fasting is shown in \nFigure 28.12 , 4. [Note: Ketone bodies are organic acids \nand, when present at high concentrations, can cause ketoacidosis.]\nIX. ADIPOSE TISSUE IN FASTING\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\nGlucose transport by insulin-sensitive GLUT-4 into the adipocyte and its subsequent metabolism are decreased because of low levels of circulating insulin. This results in decreased TAG synthesis.\nB. Fat metabolism\n 1. Increased fat degradation:  The PKA-mediated phosphorylation \nand activation of HSL (see p. 306) and subsequent hydrolysis of \nstored fat (TAG) are enhanced by the elevated catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine. These hormones, which are secreted from the sympathetic nerve endings in adipose tissue and/or from the adrenal medulla, are physiologically important activators of HSL (\nFig. 28.14 , 1).\n 2. Increased fatty acid release:  FA obtained from hydrolysis of TAG \nstored in adipocytes are primarily released into the blood (see \nFig. 28.14 , 2). Bound to albumin, they are transported to a variety \nof tissues for use as fuel. The glycerol produced from TAG degra-dation is used as a gluconeogenic precursor by the liver, which contains glycerol kinase . [Note: FA can also be oxidized to acetyl \nCoA, which can enter the TCA cycle, thereby producing energy for the adipocyte. They also can be reesterified to glycerol 3-phosphate (from glyceroneogenesis, see p. 307), generating TAG and reducing plasma FA concentration.]\n 3. Decreased fatty acid uptake:  In fasting, LPL activity of adipose \ntissue is low. Consequently, FA in circulating TAG of lipoproteins are less available to adipose tissue than to muscle.\nX. RESTING SKELETAL MUSCLE IN FASTING\nResting muscle switches from glucose to FA as its major fuel source in fasting. [Note: By contrast, exercising muscle initially uses creatine phos-phate and its glycogen stores. During intense exercise, glucose 6-phos-phate from glycogenolysis is converted to lactate by anaerobic glycolysis (see p. 217). The lactate is used by the liver for gluconeogenesis (Cori cycle; see p. 217).

The contraction-based rise in AMP activates AMPK  that phosphor-\nylates and inactivates the muscle isozyme of ACC , decreasing malonyl CoA \nand allowing FA oxidation (see p. 300).]\nA. Carbohydrate metabolism\nGlucose transport into skeletal myocytes via insulin-sensitive GLUT-4 (see p. 192) and subsequent glucose metabolism are decreased because circulating insulin levels are low. Therefore, the glucose from hepatic gluconeogenesis is unavailable to muscle and adipose.\nB. Lipid metabolism\nEarly in fasting, muscle uses FA from adipose tissue and ketone bodies from the liver as fuels (\nFig. 28.15 , 1 and 2). In prolonged fasting, \nmuscle decreases its use of ketone bodies (thus sparing them for the brain) and oxidizes FA almost exclusively. [Note: The acetyl CoA from FA oxidation indirectly inhibits PDH (by activation of PDH kinase ) and \nspares pyruvate, which is transaminated to alanine and used by the liver for gluconeogenesis (glucose\u2013alanine cycle; see p. 386).]\nC. Protein metabolism\nDuring the first few days of fasting, there is a rapid breakdown of muscle protein (for example, glycolytic enzymes), providing amino acids that are used by the liver for gluconeogenesis (see \nFig. 28.15 , 3). Because \nmuscle does not have glucagon receptors, muscle proteolysis is initi-ated by a fall in insulin and sustained by a rise in glucocorticoids. [Note: Alanine and glutamine are quantitatively the most important glucogenic amino acids released from muscle. They are produced by the catabolism of BCAA (see p. 402). The glutamine is used as a fuel by enterocytes, for example, which send out alanine that is used in hepatic gluconeo-genesis (glucose\u2013alanine cycle)]. In the second week of fasting, the rate of muscle proteolysis decreases, paralleling a decline in the need for glucose as a fuel for the brain, which has begun using ketone bodies as a source of energy.\nXI. BRAIN IN FASTING\nDuring the early days of fasting, the brain continues to use only glucose as a fuel (\nFig. 28.16 , 1). Blood glucose is maintained by hepatic gluconeo-\ngenesis from glucogenic precursors, such as amino acids from proteol-ysis and glycerol from lipolysis. In prolonged fasting (beyond 2\u20133 weeks), plasma ketone bodies (see \nFig. 28.12 ) reach significantly elevated levels \nand replace glucose as the primary fuel for the brain (see Figs. 28.16 , 2 \nand 28.17 ). This reduces the need for protein catabolism for gluconeo-\ngenesis: Ketone bodies spare glucose and, thus, muscle protein. [Note: As the duration of a fast extends from overnight to days to weeks, blood glucose levels initially drop and then are maintained at the lower level (65\u201370 mg/dl).] The metabolic changes that occur during fasting insure that all tissues have an adequate supply of fuel molecules.

The renal cortex expresses the enzymes of gluconeo-genesis, including glucose 6-phosphatase , and, in late fasting, ~50% of \ngluconeogenesis occurs here. [Note: A portion of this glucose is used by the kidney itself.] The kidney also provides compensation for the acidosis that accompanies the increased production of ketone bodies (organic acids). The glutamine released from the muscle\u2019s metabolism of BCAA is taken up by the kidney and acted upon by renal glutaminase  and gluta-\nmate dehydrogenase  (see p. 389), producing \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which can \nbe used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, plus ammonia (NH\n3). The NH 3 \npicks up protons from ketone body dissociation and is excreted in the urine as ammonium (NH\n4+), thereby decreasing the acid load in the body \n(Fig. 28.19 ). Therefore, in long-term fasting, there is a switch from nitrogen \ndisposal in the form of urea to disposal in the form of NH 4+. [Note: As \nketone body concentration rises, enterocytes, typically consumers of gluta-mine, become consumers of ketone bodies. This allows more glutamine to be available to the kidney.]\nXIII. Medical Perspectives\nFor estimation of serum lipoproteins, a fasting sample is preferred, as triglycerides (TGs) are elevated for several hours \nafter a meal. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), TG and high-density lipoprotein choles-terol (HDL-C) can be measured directly by spectrophotometry. However, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is usually calculated as TG/5. LDL may also be calculated using Friedewald equation.\nFriedewald equation says that the TC = LDL-C + HDL-C + VLDL-C. Therefore, a raised TG will lead to an erroneously \ndecreased LDL-C in calculations. LDL-C is an important target of lipid lowering therapy.\nIntermittent fasting includes diet patterns with little or no energy intake for extended periods. It is expected to promote \nweight loss by utilizing fats for energy, after muscle glycogen stores have been depleted. \nThe branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, valine and isoleucine are used by sportspersons as dietary supple-\nments to produce an anabolic response for muscle protein synthesis. However, this belief is scientifically unsubstantiated as for synthesis of new muscle protein, all the essential amino acids along with non-essential amino acids must be present in adequate amounts. Increasing intake of just BCAAs, without a concurrent increased consumption of other essential amino acids doesn\u2019t provide any additional benefit.Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)\nGlutamate + NH3 \u00c6 NH4+\na-Ketoglutarate + NH3 \u00c6 NH4+Glutaminase\nGlutamate\ndehydrogenase\nH+H+Glutamine\nFigure 28.19\nUse of glutamine from BCAA catabolism \nin muscle to generate ammonia (NH 3) \nused for the excretion of protons (H+) as \nammonium (NH 4+) in the kidneys.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   464 24-10-2020   12:11:33"

Chapter Summary\nThe flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four regulatory mechanisms : 1) the availability \nof substrates, 2) allosteric activation and inhibition of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. In the absorptive state , the 2- to 4-hour period after ingestion of a meal, these mech-\nanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen , triacylglycerol  (TAG), and protein  (\nFig. 28.20 ). During \nthis interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and TAG occur, the last primarily as components of chylomicrons  synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cells. The pancreas  responds to the elevated levels of glucose with \nan increased secretion of insulin and a decreased secretion of glucagon. The elevated insulin/glucagon ratio  and the \nready availability of circulating substrates make the absorptive state an anabolic period  during which virtually all tissues \nuse glucose  as a fuel. In addition, the liver replenishes its glycogen stores, replaces any needed hepatic proteins, and \nincreases TAG synthesis. The latter are packaged in very-low-density lipoproteins , which are exported to the peripheral \ntissues. Adipose tissue  increases TAG synthesis and storage, whereas muscle  increases protein synthesis to replace \nprotein degraded since the previous meal. In the fed state, the brain  uses glucose exclusively as a fuel. In fasting , plasma \nlevels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon and epinephrine  secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio  and the decreased availability of circu-\nlating substrates make the fasting state a catabolic period . This sets into motion an exchange of substrates  among the \nliver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need to maintain adequate plasma levels of glucose to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues and 2) the need to mobi-lize fatty acids (FA) from adipose tissue and release ketone bodies  from liver to supply energy to other tissues. To accom-\nplish these goals, the liver degrades glycogen and initiates gluconeogenesis , using increased FA oxidation  to supply \nthe energy and reducing equivalents needed for gluconeogenesis and the acetyl coenzyme A building blocks for keto-\ngenesis . The adipose tissue degrades stored TAG, thus providing FA and glycerol  to the liver. The muscle can also use \nFA as fuel as well as ketone bodies supplied by the liver. The liver uses the glycerol for gluconeogenesis. Muscle protein  \nis degraded to supply amino acids for the liver to use in gluconeogenesis but decreases as ketone bodies increase. The brain can use both glucose and ketone bodies as fuels. From late fasting into starvation, the kidneys  play important roles \nby synthesizing glucose and excreting the protons  from ketone body dissociation as ammonium  (NH\n4+).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   465 24-10-2020   12:11:33"

GlucagonAnswer\u2014A:  As ketone bodies are present in urine, it may \nbe due to diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation. Low blood glucose (57 mg/dl) rules out diabetic ketoacidosis. Also, total protein and albumin are decreased in this patient. Therefore, this is a case of starvation.\nAnswer\u2014B:  During starvation, the concentration of acetyl \nCoA is increased because of excessive fatty acid oxida-tion. However, because of a paucity of oxaloacetate (which is diverted to gluconeogenesis), citrate cannot be synthesized. Therefore, excess acetyl CoA is now diverted to ketone body formation to generate some energy.28.1. A 35-year-old male patient was brought to the \nemergency room with behavioral disturbances, including aggressiveness. History revealed volun-tary complete fasting for over a week.

OVERVIEW\nDiabetes mellitus (diabetes) is not one disease but rather is a heteroge-\nneous group of multifactorial, primarily polygenic syndromes characterized by an elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) caused by a relative or abso-lute deficiency in insulin. Over 29 million people in the United States (~9% of the population) have diabetes. Of this number, ~8 million are as yet undiagnosed. Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness and ampu-tation and a major cause of renal failure, nerve damage, heart attacks, and strokes. Most cases of diabetes mellitus can be separated into two groups (\nFig. 29.1 ), type 1 ([T1D] formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes \nmellitus) and type 2 ([T2D] formerly called non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). The incidence and prevalence of T2D is increasing because of the aging of the U.S. population and the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles (see p. 482). The increase in children with T2D is particularly disturbing.\nII. TYPE 1\nT1D constitutes <10% of the ~21 million known cases of diabetes in the United States. The disease is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin caused by an autoimmune attack on the islet \u03b2 cells of the \npancreas. In T1D, the islets of Langerhans become infiltrated with acti-vated T lymphocytes, leading to a condition called insulitis. Over a period of years, this autoimmune attack on the \u03b2 cells leads to gradual depletion of \nthe \u03b2-cell population (\nFig. 29.2 ). However, symptoms appear abruptly when \n80%\u201390% of the \u03b2 cells have been destroyed. At this point, the pancreas \nfails to respond adequately to ingestion of glucose, and insulin therapy is required to restore metabolic control and prevent life-threatening ketoac-idosis. \u03b2-Cell destruction requires both a stimulus from the environment Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the cause of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus \n\u2022 Describe the metabolic changes associated with diabetes mellitus\u2022 Explain the acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus with \nbiochemical reasoning \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   469 24-10-2020   12:11:34"

This contrasts with T2D (see p. 473), in which the genetic influence is stronger and, in virtually all monozygotic twinships, the disease eventually develops in both individuals.]\nA. Diagnosis\nThe onset of T1D is typically during childhood or puberty, and symp-toms develop suddenly. Individuals with T1D can usually be recognized by the abrupt appearance of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and polyphagia (excessive hunger), often triggered by physiologic stress such as an infection. These symptoms are usually accompanied by fatigue and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed \nby blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin levels (Appendix Unit III: Carbohydrates, p. 281).\nWhen blood glucose is >180 mg/dl, the ability of renal sodium-\ndependent glucose transporters (SGLT) to reclaim glucose is impaired, and glucose \u201cspills\u201d into urine. The loss of glucose is accompanied by the loss of water, resulting in the charac-teristic polyuria (with dehydration) and polydipsia of diabetes.\n Figure 29.1\nComparison of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

            "Text": "II. Type 1 471\nB. Metabolic changes\nThe metabolic abnormalities of T1D result from a deficiency of insulin \nthat profoundly affects metabolism in three tissues: liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose (\nFig. 29.3 ).\n 1. Hyperglycemia and ketonemia:  Elevated levels of blood glucose \nand ketone bodies are the hallmarks of untreated T1D (see \nFig. 29.3 ). Hyperglycemia is caused by increased hepatic produc-\ntion of glucose via gluconeogenesis, combined with diminished peripheral utilization (muscle and adipose tissue have the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT-4; see p. 192). Ketonemia results from increased mobilization of fatty acids (FA) from triacylg-lycerol (TAG) in adipose tissue, combined with accelerated hepatic FA \u03b2-oxidation and synthesis of 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoac-\netate (ketone bodies; see p. 313). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A from \u03b2-oxidation is the substrate for ketogenesis and the allosteric acti-\nvator of pyruvate carboxylase , a gluconeogenic enzyme.] Diabetic \nketoacidosis (DKA), a type of metabolic acidosis caused by an imbalance between ketone body production and use, occurs in 25%\u201340% of those newly diagnosed with T1D and may recur if the patient becomes ill (most commonly with an infection) or does not comply with therapy. DKA is treated by replacing fluid and elec-trolytes and administering short-acting insulin to gradually correct hyperglycemia without precipitating hypoglycemia.\n 2. Hypertriacylglycerolemia:  Not all of the FA flooding the liver can \nbe disposed of through oxidation and ketone body synthesis. These excess FA are converted to TAG, which are packaged and secreted in very-low-density lipoproteins ([VLDL], see p. 353). Chylomicrons rich in dietary TAG are secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells following a meal (see p. 351). Because lipoprotein TAG degrada-tion catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase  in the capillary beds of adipose \ntissue (see p. 352) is low in diabetes (synthesis of the enzyme is decreased when insulin levels are low), the plasma chylomicron and VLDL levels are elevated, resulting in hypertriacylglycerolemia (see \nFig. 29.3 ).\nC. Treatment\nIndividuals with T1D must rely on exogenous insulin delivered subcu-taneously (subq) either by periodic injection or by continuous pump-assisted infusion to control the hyperglycemia and ketonemia. Two types of therapeutic injection regimens are currently used, standard and intensive. [Note: Pump delivery is also considered intensive therapy.]\n 1. Standard versus intensive treatment:  Standard treatment is typi-\ncally two to three daily injections of recombinant human insulin. Mean blood glucose levels obtained are typically 225\u2013275 mg/dl, with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA\n1c) level (see p. 111) of 8%\u20139% of \nthe total hemoglobin (blue arrow in Fig. 29.4 ). In contrast to stan-\ndard therapy, intensive treatment seeks to more closely normalize blood glucose through more frequent monitoring and subsequent injections of insulin, typically \u22654 times a day. Mean blood glucose levels of 150 mg/dl can be achieved, with HbA\n1c ~7% of the total \nhemoglobin (see red arrow in Fig. 29.4 ).

Nonetheless, patients on intensive therapy show a \u226550% reduction in the long-term microvascular complications of diabetes (that is, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) compared with patients receiving standard care. This confirms that the complications of diabetes are related to an elevation of plasma glucose.\n 2. Hypoglycemia:  One of the therapeutic goals in cases of diabetes is \nto decrease blood glucose levels in an effort to minimize the devel-opment of long-term complications of the disease (see p. 477 for a discussion of the chronic complications of diabetes). However, appropriate dosage of insulin is difficult to achieve. Hypoglycemia caused by excess insulin is the most common complication of insulin therapy, occurring in >90% of patients. The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, seizures, and coma is particularly high with intensive treatment regimens designed to achieve tight control of blood glucose (\nFig. 29.5 ). In normal individuals, hypoglycemia \ntriggers a compensatory secretion of counterregulatory hormones, most notably glucagon and epinephrine, which promote hepatic production of glucose (see p. 443). However, patients with T1D also develop a deficiency of glucagon secretion.

However, as the disease progresses, T1D patients show diabetic autonomic neuropathy and impaired ability to secrete epinephrine in response to hypoglycemia. The combined deficiency of glucagon and epinephrine secretion creates a symptom-free condition sometimes called \u201chypoglycemia unawareness.\u201d Thus, patients with long-standing T1D are particu-larly vulnerable to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also be caused by strenuous exercise. Because exercise promotes glucose uptake into muscle and decreases the need for exogenous insulin, patients are advised to check blood glucose levels before or after intensive exercise to prevent or abort hypoglycemia.\n 3. Contraindications for tight control:  Children are not put on \na program of tight control of blood glucose before age 8 years because of the risk that episodes of hypoglycemia may adversely affect brain development. Elderly people typically do not go on tight control because hypoglycemia can cause strokes and heart attacks in this population. Also, the major goal of tight control is to prevent complications many years later. Tight control, then, is most worth-while for otherwise healthy people who can expect to live at least 10 more years. [Note: For most nonpregnant adults with diabetes, the individual treatment strategies and goals are based on the duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, and known comorbid conditions.]\nIII. TYPE 2\nT2D is the most common form of the disease, afflicting >90% of the U.S. population with diabetes. [Note: American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic and Latino Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans have the highest prevalence.] Typically, T2D develops gradually without obvious symptoms. The disease is often detected by routine screening tests. However, many individuals with T2D have symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia of several weeks\u2019 duration. Polyphagia may be present but is less common. Patients with T2D have a combination of insulin resistance and dysfunctional \u03b2 cells (\nFig. 29.6 ) but do not require insulin to sustain \nlife. However, in >90% of these patients, insulin eventually will be required to control hyperglycemia and keep HbA\n1c <7%. The metabolic alterations \nobserved in T2D are milder than those described for type 1, in part because insulin secretion in T2D, although inadequate, does restrain ketogenesis and blunts the development of DKA. [Note: Insulin suppresses the release of glucagon (see p. 442).] Diagnosis is based on the presence of hyper-glycemia as described above. The pathogenesis does not involve viruses or autoimmune antibodies and is not completely understood. [Note: An acute complication of T2D in the elderly is a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state characterized by severe hyperglycemia and dehydration and altered mental status.]\nT2D is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, \nimpaired insulin secretion, and, ultimately, \u03b2-cell failure.

Insulin resistance\nInsulin resistance is the decreased ability of target tissues, such as the \nliver, white adipose, and skeletal muscle, to respond properly to normal (or elevated) circulating concentrations of insulin. For example, insulin resistance is characterized by increased hepatic glucose production, decreased glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue, and increased adipose lipolysis with production of free fatty acids (FFA).\n 1. Insulin resistance and obesity:  Although obesity is the most \ncommon cause of insulin resistance and increases the risk of T2D, most people with obesity and insulin resistance do not develop diabetes. In the absence of a defect in \u03b2-cell function, obese indi-\nviduals can compensate for insulin resistance with elevated levels of insulin. For example, \nFigure 29.7A  shows that insulin secretion is \ntwo to three times higher in obese subjects than it is in lean individ-uals. This higher insulin concentration compensates for the dimin-ished effect of the hormone (as a result of insulin resistance) and produces blood glucose levels similar to those observed in lean individuals (\nFig. 29.7B ).\n 2. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes:  Insulin resistance alone \nwill not lead to T2D. Rather, T2D develops in insulin-resistant indi-viduals who also show impaired \u03b2-cell function. Insulin resistance \nand subsequent risk for the development of T2D is commonly observed in individuals who are obese, physically inactive, or elderly and in the 3%\u20135% of pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes. These patients are unable to sufficiently compensate for insulin resistance with increased insulin release.\n Figure 29.8  shows \nthe time course for the development of hyperglycemia and the loss of \u03b2-cell function.\n 3. Causes of insulin resistance:  Insulin resistance increases with \nweight gain and decreases with weight loss, and excess adipose tissue (particularly in the abdomen, known as central obesity) is key in the development of insulin resistance. Adipose is not simply an energy storage tissue, but also a secretory tissue. With obesity, there are changes in adipose secretions that result in insulin resis-tance (\nFig. 29.9 ). These include secretion of proinflammatory cyto-\nkines such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 by activated \nmacrophages (inflammation is associated with insulin resistance); LIVER \nMUSCLE Glucose Increased\nproductionof glucose Insulin resistance in \nperipheral tissues \nADIPOSE\nTISSUEDecreased\nglucose uptakeby insulin-sensitive GLUT-4 \nInadequate insulin \nsecretion from b cells \nPANCREAS Insulin 1\n2\nFigure 29.6\nMajor factors contributing to \nhyperglycemia observed in type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 475\nincreased synthesis of leptin, a protein with proinflammatory effects \n(see p. 486 for additional effects of leptin); and decreased secretion of adiponectin (see p. 483), a protein with anti-inflammatory effects. The net result is chronic, low-grade inflammation. One effect of insulin resistance is increased lipolysis and production of FFA (see \nFig. 29.9 ). FFA availability decreases use of glucose, contributing \nto hyperglycemia, and increases ectopic deposition of TAG in liver (hepatic steatosis). [Note: Steatosis results in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). If accompanied by inflammation, a more serious condition, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), can develop.] FFA also have a proinflammatory effect. In the long term, FFA impair insulin signaling. [Note: Adiponectin increases FA \u03b2-oxidation (see \np. 484). Consequently, a decrease in this adipocyte protein contrib-utes to FFA availability.]\nB. Dysfunctional \u03b2 cells\nIn T2D, the pancreas initially retains \u03b2-cell capacity, resulting in insulin \nlevels that vary from above normal to below normal. However, with time, the \u03b2 cell becomes increasingly dysfunctional and fails to secrete \nenough insulin to correct the prevailing hyperglycemia. For example, insulin levels are high in typical, obese, T2D patients but not as high as in similarly obese individuals who do not have diabetes. Thus, the natural progression of the disease results in a declining ability to control hyperglycemia with endogenous secretion of insulin (\nFig. 29.10 ). \nDeterioration of \u03b2-cell function may be accelerated by the toxic effects \nof sustained hyperglycemia and elevated FFA and a proinflammatory environment.\u201310200250\n150\n100\n50\n0250300\n200\n150\n100\n50\n\u20135 0 5 10 15 20 25\u2013 1 0 \u2013 5 5 1 01 52 02 5Glucose\n(mg/dl)Insulin secretion\n(percent of normal)\nYears of diabetesInsulin levels in untreated type 2 diabetesNormalNormalFasting glucose in untreated type 2 diabetes\nDiagnosis of diabetesYears of diabetes\n\u201310\u201310\n \u20135\nDiagno sis of diabbe\neetes\n20\n 25\nNormal\nbetes\nNNNormal\nbetes\n5\n 10\n 15\nYearrrs of diabeetes\n5\nPatients diagnosed with type 2 \ndiabetes initially show insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia.

            "Text": "IV. Chronic Effects and Prevention 477\n 1. Hyperglycemia:  Hyperglycemia is caused by increased hepatic \nproduction of glucose, combined with diminished use of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Ketonemia is usually minimal or absent in patients with T2D because the presence of insulin, even in the presence of insulin resistance, restrains hepatic ketogenesis.\n 2. Dyslipidemia:  In the liver, FFA are converted to TAG, which are \npackaged and secreted in VLDL. Dietary TAG\u2013rich chylomicrons are synthesized and secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells following a meal. Because lipoprotein TAG degradation catalyzed by lipoprotein \nlipase  in adipose tissue is low in diabetes, the plasma chylomicron \nand VLDL levels are elevated, resulting in hypertriacylglycerolemia (see \nFig. 29.10 ). Low levels of high-density lipoproteins are also \nassociated with T2D, likely as a result of increased degradation.\nD. Treatment\nWeight reduction, exercise, and medical nutrition therapy (dietary modi-fications) often correct the hyperglycemia of newly diagnosed T2D. Oral hypoglycemic agents, or subq insulin therapy may be required to achieve satisfactory plasma glucose levels. [Note: Bariatric surgery in morbidly obese individuals with T2D has been shown to result in disease remission in most patients. Remission may not be permanent.]\nIV. CHRONIC EFFECTS AND PREVENTION\nAs noted previously, available therapies moderate the hyperglycemia of diabetes but fail to completely normalize metabolism. The long-standing elevation of blood glucose is associated with the chronic vascular compli-cations of diabetes including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke (macrovascular complications) as well as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (microvascular). Intensive insulin treatment (see p. 472) delays the onset and slows the progression of some long-term complications. For example, the incidence of retinopathy decreases as control of blood glucose improves and HbA\n1c levels decrease ( Fig. 29.12 ). [Note: Data concerning \nthe effect of tight control on CVD in T2D are less clear.] The benefits of tight control of blood glucose outweigh the increased risk of severe hypogly-cemia in most patients. How hyperglycemia causes the chronic complica-tions of diabetes is unclear. In cells in which glucose uptake is not dependent on insulin, elevated blood glucose leads to increased intracellular glucose and its metabolites. For example, increased intracellular sorbitol contrib-utes to cataract formation (see p. 243) in diabetes. Additionally, hypergly-cemia promotes glycation of cellular proteins in a reaction analogous to the formation of HbA\n1c. These glycated proteins undergo additional reac-\ntions and become advanced glycation end products (AGE) that mediate some of the early microvascular changes of diabetes and can reduce wound healing. Some AGE bind to a membrane receptor (RAGE), causing the release of proinflammatory molecules. There is currently no preventa-tive treatment for T1D. The risk for T2D can be significantly decreased by a combined regimen of medical nutrition therapy, weight loss, exercise, and aggressive control of hypertension and dyslipidemias. For example, \nFigure 29.13  shows the incidence of disease in normal and overweight indi-\nviduals with varying degrees of exercise.24\nLength of follow-up (years)10%\n9%\n8%\n7%Prevalence of retinopathy (%)12\n01234567890Mean HbA 1c = 11%\n24\n10%\n9%\nMean Hb A\n1c\n = 11%The benefits of an improvement \nin glycemic control occurred over the entire range of HbA\n1c values. \nThus, any improvement in glycemic control is beneficial.\nFigure 29.12\nRelationship of glycemic control and \ndiabetic retinopathy.

Chapter Summary\nDiabetes mellitus  is a heterogeneous group of syndromes characterized by an elevation  of fasting blood glucose  that \nis caused by a relative or absolute deficiency of insulin ( Fig. 29.14 ). Diabetes mellitus affects 415 million people in the \nworld with 69.2 million in India alone. Asia has more than 75% of the global burden of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness  and amputation  and a major cause of renal failure , nerve damage , heart attacks , \nand stroke . Diabetes can be classified into two groups, type 1  (T1D) and type 2  (T2D). T1D constitutes about 10% of \ntotal diabetes cases in India. The disease is characterized by an absolute deficiency  of insulin  caused by an autoim-\nmune attack  on the pancreatic \u03b2 cells . This destruction requires an environmental stimulus  (such as a viral infection) \nand a genetic determinant  that causes the \u03b2 cell to be mistakenly identified as \u201cnonself.\u201d The metabolic abnormalities  \nof T1D include hyperglycemia , diabetic ketoacidosis  (DKA ), and hypertriacylglycerolemia  that result from a deficiency \nof insulin. Those with T1D must rely on exogenous insulin  delivered subcutaneously to control hyperglycemia and keto-\nacidosis. T2D has a strong genetic  component. It results from a combination of insulin resistance  and dysfunctional \n\u03b2 cells . Insulin resistance is the decreased ability of target tissues, such as liver, white adipose, and skeletal muscle, \nto respond properly to normal (or elevated) circulating concentrations of insulin. Obesity  is the most common cause of \ninsulin resistance. However, most people with obesity and insulin resistance do not develop diabetes. In the absence of a defect in \u03b2-cell function, obese individuals without diabetes can compensate for insulin resistance with elevated levels \nof insulin. Insulin resistance alone will not lead to T2D. Rather, T2D develops in insulin-resistant individuals who also show impaired \u03b2-cell function. The acute metabolic alterations  observed in T2D are milder  than those described for the \ninsulin-dependent form of the disease, in part because insulin secretion in T2D, although inadequate, does restrain keto-\ngenesis  and blunts the development of DKA. Available treatments for diabetes moderate the hyperglycemia but fail to \ncompletely normalize metabolism. The long-standing elevation of blood glucose is associated with the chronic compli-\ncations  of diabetes including cardiovascular disease  and stroke  (macrovascular ) as well as retinopathy , nephrop-\nathy, and neuropathy  (\nmicrovascular ).V. Medical Perspectives\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a major global health problem. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults is nearly 8.5%, \nwith DM being a leading cause of death. Asians are at higher risk to develop insulin resistance, which may be linked to central obesity, genetic factors, dietary and lifestyle patterns. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart  \nattacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. Besides the micro- and macrovascular complications, diabetic patients are also more prone to infections, especially of skin and urinary tract.\nKetosis may be seen in starvation and diabetes. Salient features of ketosis include Kussmaul respiration and smell of \nacetone in patient\u2019s breath. Excessive ketone bodies in blood can cause metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. Ketone bodies in urine can be diagnosed by urine dipstick test and Rothera\u2019s test. Normal level for ketones in blood is <1 mg/dl. The urine ketone dipstick test is a simple, semi-quantitative method for detection (based on nitro-prusside reaction) of acetoacetate. It can even be done by patient himself. It does not detect \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate.\nDiabetic patients, due to neuropathy, may not manifest symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI), a condition known as \nsilent MI. Lack of pain in silent MI increases morbidity and mortality, since patients do not seek medical treatment in time.\nHomeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is a method for assessing \u03b2-cell function and insulin \nresistance (IR) from fasting glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations. The relationship between glucose and insulin in the fasting (basal) state reflects the balance between hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion.\nDiabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with lifestyle modifications (diet, physical activity), \nmedication and regular screening and treatment for complications. Acute complications of diabetics are mainly ketoaci-dosis and hypoglycemia (because of treatment overdose or lack of food after insulin medication).\nLong-term diabetics should be routinely assessed for retinopathy, cataract, peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy and \nmacrovascular complications like cardiovascular risk.\nBlood glucose values can be expressed in mg/dl or mmol/l. Values in mmol/l can be multiplied with 18 to get the value \nin mg/dl.\nWorld Diabetes Day is observed on 14 November every year.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   478 24-10-2020   12:11:41"

In primitive societies, in which daily life required a high level of physical activity and food was only available intermittently, a genetic tendency favoring storage of excess calories as fat may have had a survival value. Today, however, the sedentary lifestyle and abundance and wide variety of palatable, inexpensive foods in indus-trialized societies has undoubtedly contributed to an obesity epidemic. As adiposity has increased, so has the risk of developing associated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), hyperten-sion, cancer, and arthritis. Particularly alarming is the explosion of obesity in children and adolescents, which has shown a threefold increase in prev-alence over the last four decades. [Note: Approximately 17% of those age 2\u201319 years are obese.] In the United States, the lifetime risk of becoming overweight or obese is ~50% and 25%, respectively. Obesity has increased globally, and, by some estimates, there are more obese than undernour-ished individuals worldwide.\nII. ASSESSMENT\nBecause the amount of body fat is difficult to measure directly, it is usually determined from an indirect measure, the body mass index (BMI), which has been shown to correlate with the amount of body fat in most individ-uals. [Note: Exceptions are athletes who have large amounts of lean muscle mass.] Measuring the waist size with a tape measure is also used to screen for obesity, because this measurement reflects the amount of fat in the central abdominal area of the body. The presence of excess central fat is associated with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality, independent of the BMI. [Note: A waist size \u226540 in (men) and \u226535 in (women) is consid-ered a risk factor.]Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the causes (including dietary habits) of obesity\n\u2022 Discuss the metabolic effects of obesity\u2022 Describe the health risks associated with being overweight/obese\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   482 24-10-2020   12:11:43"

            "Text": "II. Assessment 483\nA. Body mass index\nThe BMI (defined as weight in kg/[height in m]2) provides a measure of \nrelative weight, adjusted for height. This allows comparisons within and between populations. The healthy range for the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. Individuals with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 are considered overweight, those with a BMI \u226530 are defined as obese, and a BMI >40 is considered severely (morbidly) obese (\nFig. 30.1 ). These cutoffs are \nbased on studies examining the relationship of BMI to premature death and are similar in men and women. Nearly two thirds of U.S. adults are overweight, and more than one third of those are obese. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (\u226523.0 kg/m\n2) and obesity (\u226525.0 kg/m2) \nare lower due to other risk factors and morbidities. Children with a BMI-for-age above the 95th percentile are considered obese.\nB. Anatomic differences in fat deposition\nThe anatomic distribution of body fat has a major influence on asso-ciated health risks. A waist/hip ratio (WHR) >0.8 for women and >1.0 for men is defined as android, apple-shaped, or upper-body obesity and is associated with more fat deposition in the trunk (\nFig. 30.2A ). In \ncontrast, a lower WHR reflects a preponderance of fat distributed in the hips and thighs and is called gynoid, pear-shaped, or lower-body obesity. It is defined as a WHR of <0.8 for women and <1.0 for men. The pear shape, more commonly found in women, presents a much lower risk of metabolic disease, and some studies indicate that it may actually be protective. Thus, the clinician can use simple indices of body shape to identify those who may be at higher risk for metabolic diseases associated with obesity.\nAbout 80%\u201390% of human body fat is stored in subcutaneous \n(subq) depots in the abdominal (upper body) and the gluteal-femoral (lower body) regions. The remaining 10%\u201320% is in visceral depots located deep within the abdominal cavity (\nFig. 30.2B ). Excess fat in visceral and abdominal subq stores \nincreases health risks associated with obesity.\n \nC. Biochemical differences in regional fat depots\nThe regional types of fat described above are biochemically different. \nSubq adipocytes from the lower body, particularly in women, are larger, very efficient at fat (triacylglycerol [TAG]) deposition, and tend to mobi-lize fatty acids (FA) more slowly than subq adipocytes from the upper body. Visceral adipocytes are the most metabolically active. In obese individuals, both abdominal subcutaneous and visceral depots have high rates of lipolysis and contribute to increased availability of free fatty acids (FFA). These metabolic differences may contribute to the higher health risk found in individuals with upper body (abdominal) obesity. [Note: FFA impair insulin signaling and are proinflammatory (see p. 475).]\n 1. Endocrine function:  White adipose tissue, once thought to be a \npassive reservoir of TAG, is now known to play an active role in body weight regulatory systems. For example, the adipocyte is an endo-crine cell that secretes a number of protein regulators (adipokines), such as the hormones leptin and adiponectin.

Adiponectin reduces \nFFA levels in the blood (by increasing FA oxidation in muscles) and has been associated with improved lipid profiles, increased insulin sensitivity resulting in better glycemic control, and reduced inflam-mation in patients with diabetes. [Note: Adiponectin levels decrease as body weight increases, whereas leptin levels increase.]\n 2. Importance of portal circulation:  With obesity, there is increased \nrelease of FFA and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1), from \nadipose tissue. [Note: Cytokines are small proteins that regulate the immune system.] One hypothesis for why abdominal adipose depots have such a large influence on metabolic dysfunction in obesity is that the FFA and cytokines released from these depots enter the portal vein and, therefore, have direct access to the liver. In the liver, they may lead to insulin resistance (see p. 475) and increased hepatic synthesis of TAG, which are released as compo-nents of very-low-density lipoprotein particles and contribute to the hypertriacylglycerolemia associated with obesity. By contrast, FFA from lower body subq adipose depots enter the general circulation, where they can be oxidized in muscle and, therefore, reach the liver in lower concentration.\nD. Adipocyte size and number\nAs TAG are stored, adipocytes can expand to an average of two to three times their normal volume (\nFig. 30.3 ). However, the ability of fat \ncells to expand is limited. With prolonged overnutrition, preadipocytes within adipose tissue are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into mature fat cells, increasing the number of adipocytes. Thus, most obesity is due to a combination of increased fat cell size (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia). Obese individuals can have up to five times the normal number of adipocytes. [Note: Like other tissues, the adipose tissue undergoes continuous remodeling. Contrary to early dogma, we now know that adipocytes can die. The estimated average lifespan of an adipocyte is 10 years.] If excess calories cannot be accommodated within adipose tissue, the excess FA \u201cspill over\u201d into other tissues, such as muscle and the liver. The amount of this ectopic fat is strongly associ-ated with insulin resistance. With weight loss in an obese individual, the size of the fat cells is reduced, but the number is not usually affected. Thus, a normal amount of body fat is achieved by decreasing the size of the fat cell below normal. However, small fat cells are very efficient at reaccumulating fat, and this may drive appetite and weight regain.\nIII. BODY WEIGHT REGULATION\nThe body weight of most individuals tends to be relatively stable over time. This observation prompted the hypothesis that each individual has a biologically predetermined \u201cset point\u201d for body weight. The body attempts to add to adipose stores when the body weight falls below the set point and to lose adipose from stores when the body weight rises above the set point. Thus, the body defends the set point. For example, with weight loss, appetite increases and energy expenditure falls, whereas with overfeeding, appetite falls and energy expenditure may slightly increase (\nFig. 30.4 ). \nHowever, a strict set point model explains neither why some individuals fail \nApple shape  =\nupper-body\nobesityPear shape  =\nlower-body\nobesityHipsWaist Waist\nSubcutaneous fat\nVisceral fatBody shape\nLocation of\nsubcutaneous andvisceral fat A\nBThighs\nFigure 30.2\nA.

Genetic contributions\nIt is now evident that genetic mechanisms play a major role in deter-mining body weight.\n 1. Biologic origin:  The importance of genetics as a determinant of \nobesity is indicated by the observation that children who are adopted usually show a body weight that correlates with their biologic rather than adoptive parents. Furthermore, identical twins have very similar BMI (\nFig. 30.5 ), whether reared together or apart, and their BMI are \nmore similar than those of nonidentical, dizygotic twins.\n 2. Mutations:  Rare, single gene mutations can cause human obesity. \nFor example, mutations in the gene for leptin (causing decreased production) or its receptor (decreased function) result in hyper-phagia (increased appetite for and consumption of food) and severe obesity (\nFig. 30.6 ), underscoring the importance of the leptin system \nin regulating human body weight (see IV below). [Note: Most obese humans have elevated leptin levels but are resistant to the appetite-regulating effects of this hormone.]\nB. Environmental and behavioral contributions\nThe epidemic of obesity occurring over the last several decades cannot be simply explained by changes in genetic factors, which are stable on this short time scale. Clearly, environmental factors, such as the ready availability of palatable, energy-dense foods, play a role. Furthermore, sedentary lifestyles decrease physical activity and enhance the tendency to gain weight. Eating behaviors, such as portion size, variety of foods consumed, an individual\u2019s food preferences, and the number of people present during eating, also influence food consumption. However, it is important to note that many individuals in this same environment do not become obese. The susceptibility to obesity appears to be explained, at least in part, by an interaction of an individual\u2019s genes and his or her environment and can be influenced by additional factors such as maternal under- or overnutrition that may \u201cset\u201d the body regulatory systems to defend a higher or lower level of body fat. Thus, epigenetic changes (see p. 667) likely influence the risk for obesity.\nIV. MOLECULAR INFLUENCES\nThe cause of obesity can be summarized in a deceptively simple appli-cation of the first law of thermodynamics: Obesity results when energy (caloric) intake exceeds energy expenditure. However, the mechanism underlying this imbalance involves a complex interaction of biochemical, neurologic, environmental, and psychologic factors. The basic neural and humoral pathways that regulate appetite, energy expenditure, and body weight involve systems that regulate short-term food intake (meal to meal), and signals for the long-term (day to day, week to week, year to year) regu-lation of body weight (\nFig. 30.7 ).\nWeight \ngain\nWeight \nlossWeight \ngain\nWeight \ngainPre-\nadipocyteModest weight gain or loss in a non-\nobese person mainly affects the size,but not the number, of adipocytes.\nWhen adipocytes \nreach their maximumsize, further weightgain is achieved by recruitment and proliferation of new preadipocytes.\nloss\nWeight loss occurs mainly by a \ndecrease in adipocyte size.\nFigure 30.3\nHypertrophic (increased size) and \nhyperplastic (increased number) changes to adipocytes are thought to occur in severe obesity.\nPeriod of\nforced under-eatingPeriod of \nforced over-eatingNo restrictions\non food consumption\nNo restrictions\non food consumptionBody weight Body weightStarting weight\nStarting weight\nPeriod of\nforced under-\neating\nNo restrictions\non food\nconsumption\nBody w\n weight\nBody weight returns to its initial \nstarting point after either experimentaloverfeeding or underfeeding.\nFigure 30.4\nWeight changes following episodes of \noverfeeding or underfeeding followed by feeding with no restrictions.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   485 24-10-2020   12:11:44"

            "Text": "486 30. Obesity\nA. Long-term signals\nLong-term signals reflect the status of fat (TAG) stores.\n 1. Leptin:  Leptin is an adipocyte peptide hormone that is made and \nsecreted in proportion to the size of fat stores. It acts on the brain to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. When we consume more calories than we need, body fat increases, and leptin produc-tion by adipocytes increases. The body adapts by increasing energy use (increasing activity) and decreasing appetite (an anorexigenic effect). When body fat decreases, the opposite effects occur. Unfortunately, most obese individuals are leptin resistant, and the leptin system may be better at preventing weight loss than preventing weight gain. [Note: Leptin\u2019s effects are mediated through binding to receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.]\n 2. Insulin:  Obese individuals are also hyperinsulinemic. Like leptin, \ninsulin acts on hypothalamic neurons to dampen appetite. (See Chapter 27 for the effects of insulin on metabolism.) [Note: Obesity is associated with insulin resistance (see p. 474).]\nB. Short-term signals\nShort-term signals from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract control hunger and satiety, which affect the size and number of meals over a time course of minutes to hours. In the absence of food intake (between meals), the stomach produces ghrelin, an orexigenic (appetite-stimu-lating) hormone that drives hunger. As food is consumed, GI hormones, including cholecystokinin and peptide YY , among others, induce satiety (an anorexigenic effect), thereby terminating eating, through actions on gastric emptying and neural signals to the hypothalamus. Within the hypothalamus, neuropeptides (such as orexigenic neuropeptide Y [NPY] and anorexigenic \u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone [ \u03b1-MSH]) \nand neurotransmitters (such as anorexigenic serotonin and dopamine) are important in regulating hunger and satiety. Long-term and short-term signals interact, insofar as leptin increases secretion of \u03b1-MSH and \ndecreases secretion of NPY . Thus, there are many complex regulatory loops that control the size and number of meals in relationship to the status of body fat stores. [Note: \u03b1-MSH, a cleavage product of proopi-\nomelanocortin, binds to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). Loss-of-function mutations to MC4R are associated with early-onset obesity.]\nV. METABOLIC EFFECTS\nThe primary metabolic effects of obesity include dyslipidemias, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance expressed primarily in the liver, skel-etal muscle, and adipose tissue. These metabolic abnormalities reflect molecular signals originating from the increased mass of adipocytes (see Fig. 29.9, p. 475, and \nFig. 30.7 ). [Note: About 30% of obese individuals do \nnot show these metabolic abnormalities.]\nA. Metabolic syndrome\nAbdominal obesity is associated with a cluster of metabolic abnormal-ities (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia [low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and elevated TAG], and \nFigure 30.5\nIdentical twins with combined weight of \n1,300 lb.

The low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation seen with obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D and likely plays a role in metabolic syndrome. In obesity, adipocytes release proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1. Additionally, levels of adiponectin, which normally dampens \ninflammation and sensitizes tissues to insulin, are low.\nB. Nonalcoholic liver disease\nObesity is associated with ectopic deposition of TAG in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and results in increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ([NAFLD], see p. 475).\nVI. OBESITY AND HEALTH\nObesity is correlated with an increased risk of death ( Fig. 30.9 ) and is a risk \nfactor for a number of chronic conditions, including T2D, dyslipidemias, hypertension, CVD, some cancers, gallstones, arthritis, gout, pelvic floor disorders (for example, urinary incontinence), NAFLD, and sleep apnea. The relationship between obesity and associated morbidities is stronger among individuals age <55 years. After age 74 years, there is no longer an association between increased BMI and mortality. [Note: Obesity also has social consequences (for example, stigmatization and discrimina-tion).] Weight loss in obese individuals leads to decreased blood pressure, plasma TAG, and blood glucose levels. HDL increase.\nVII. WEIGHT REDUCTION\nWeight reduction can help reduce the complications of obesity. To achieve weight reduction, the obese patient must decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure, although decreasing energy intake is thought to contribute more to inducing weight loss. Typically, a plan for weight reduction combines dietary change; increased physical activity; and behav-ioral modification, which can include nutrition education and meal planning, recording food intake through food diaries, modifying factors that lead to overeating, and relearning cues to satiety. Medications or surgery may be recommended. Once weight loss is achieved, weight maintenance is a separate process that requires vigilance because the majority of patients regain weight after they stop their weight-loss efforts.\nA. Caloric restriction\nDieting is the most commonly practiced approach to weight control. Because 1 lb of adipose tissue corresponds to ~3,500 kcal, the effect that caloric restriction will have on the amount of adipose tissue can be estimated. Weight loss on calorie-restricted diets is determined primarily by caloric intake and not nutrient composition. [Note: However, compo-sitional aspects can affect glycemic control and the blood lipid profile.] Caloric restriction is ineffective over the long term for many individuals. Over 90% of people who attempt to lose weight regain the lost weight when dietary intervention is suspended. Nonetheless, although few individuals will reach their ideal weight with treatment, weight losses of 10% of body weight over a 6-month period often reduce blood pres-sure and lipid levels and enhance control of T2D.Overnourished\nSTOMACHADIPOSE \nTISSUE\nOther factors (such as the availability of \npalatable, energy-dense foods and poor food choices) mediated by complex neural pathwaysPANCREASEfferent signals: \n\u2022 Decreased appetite\n\u2022 Increased energy \n  expenditure\nInsulin\nGhrelin\nCCK, PYYLeptinBHypothalamusUndernourished\nSTOMACHADIPOSE \nTISSUEPANCREASEfferent signals: \n\u2022 Increased appetite\n\u2022 Decreased energy \n  expenditure\nHypothalamusInsulin\nGhrelin\nCCK, PYYLeptinA\nAfferent satiety \nand adiposity signals \nINTESTINEINTESTINE\nAfferent satiety \nand adiposity signals \nFigure 30.7\nSome signals that influence appetite \nand satiety in undernourished (A) and overnourished (B) states. \nCCK = cholecystokinin; PYY = peptide YY.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   487 24-10-2020   12:11:45"

Although \nadding exercise to a hypocaloric regimen may not produce a greater weight loss initially, exercise is a key component of programs directed at maintaining weight loss. In addition, physical activity increases cardio-pulmonary fitness and reduces the risk of CVD, independent of weight loss. Persons who combine caloric restriction and exercise with behav-ioral treatment may expect to lose ~5%\u201310% of initial body weight over a period of 4\u20136 months. Studies show that individuals who maintain their exercise program regain less weight after their initial weight loss.\nC. Pharmacologic treatment\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several weight-loss medications for use in adults. They include orlistat (decreases absorption of dietary fat), lorcaserin and phentermine in combination with topiramate (promote satiety through serotonin signaling), liraglutide (decreases appetite by activating the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor), and buproprion in combination with naltrexone (increase metabolism by increasing norepinephrine). Their effects on weight reduction tend to be modest. [Note: Pharmacologic activation of brown adipocytes (see p. 170) is being explored.]\nD. Surgical treatment\nGastric bypass and restriction surgeries are effective in causing weight loss in severely obese individuals. Through mechanisms that remain poorly understood, these operations greatly improve glycemic control in morbidly obese diabetic individuals.

Medical Perspectives\nObesity rates are increasing worldwide, and it is recognized by the WHO as one of the \u201cgreatest public health challenges \nof the 21st century.\u201d As it is a complex problem with numerous interconnected variables, reducing obesity poses a signif-icant challenge.\nThe cause of obesity is an imbalance between the energy intake and the energy expenditure. The excess energy is stored \nin fat cells that enlarge and/or increase in number. The consequences arise from the increased mass of fat itself (stigma of obesity, behavioral changes, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea) or from the metabolic changes associated with excess fat (diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease).\nHormones and cytokines secreted by adipose tissues are known as adipokines. They can have both pro- and anti-inflam-\nmatory effects and include TNF- \u03b1 and IL-6 (pro-inflammatory), leptin, and adiponectin. Plasma levels of adiponectin are \ninversely related to fat stores and low adiponectin levels are associated with increased insulin resistance, whereas high adiponectin levels indicate improved insulin sensitivity.\nTo assess the body fat composition, surrogate markers such as BMI and waist: hip ratio are commonly used. For better \ncomposition analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can be used. DEXA uses X-rays to measure whole body bone mass and soft tissue composition. It can measure regional body composition by subdividing the body using specific well-defined cut lines.\nThe foremost strategy to manage weight is dietary and lifestyle interventions. WHO recommends at least 150 minutes of \nmoderate intensity exercises every week to maintain good health. Obesity due to other medical disorders like hypothy-roidism, Cushing's syndrome, etc. require the management of underlying diseases.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   488 24-10-2020   12:11:46"

Chapter Summary\nObesity , the accumulation of excess body fat, results when energy  (caloric ) intake  exceeds energy expenditure  \n(Fig. 30.10 ). Obesity is increasing in industrialized countries because of a reduction in daily energy expenditure and an \nincrease in energy intake resulting from the increasing availability of palatable, inexpensive foods. The body mass index  \n(BMI) is easy to determine and highly correlated to body fat. Nearly 69% of U.S. adults are overweight  (BMI \u226525), and \n>33% of this group are obese  (BMI \u226530). The anatomic distribution of body fat has a major influence on associated \nhealth risks. Excess fat located in the abdomen  (upper body, apple shape), as reflected in waist size , is associated with \ngreater risk for hypertension , insulin resistance , diabetes , dyslipidemia , and coronary heart disease  as compared \nto fat located in the hips and thighs (lower body, pear shape). A person\u2019s weight is determined by genetic and environ-mental factors. Appetite  is influenced by afferent, or incoming, signals (that is, neural signals, circulating hormones such \nas leptin , and metabolites) that are integrated by the hypothalamus . These diverse signals prompt release of hypotha-\nlamic peptides (such as neuropeptide Y  and \u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone ) and activate outgoing, efferent neural \nsignals. Obesity is correlated with an increased risk of death  and is also a risk factor for a number of chronic conditions . \nWeight reduction  is achieved best with negative energy balance , that is, by decreasing caloric intake and increasing \nphysical activity. Virtually all diets that limit particular groups of foods or macronutrients lead to short-term weight loss. Long-term maintenance of weight loss is difficult to achieve. Modest reduction in food intake occurs with pharmacologic \ntreatment . Surgical procedures , such as gastric bypass, designed to limit food intake are an option for the severely \nobese patient who has not responded to other treatments.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   489 24-10-2020   12:11:47"

Diabetes may \nremain undiagnosed for long, with continuous disease progression leading to complications. Screening of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) can lead to early diagnosis and management with lifestyle modifications and treatment. Screening can be done by plasma glucose or HbA\n1c level \n(Reference: Appendix Unit III\u2014Carbohydrates).\nIn India, the National Programme for the Prevention and Control of Cancer, \nDiabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) was initiated in 2010 with the focus on screening for common NCDs, at District and Community Health Center (CHC) levels, through NCD clinics.\nDiabetic patients on antihyperglycemic medications can develop hypogly-\ncemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include anxiety, sweating, confusion, feeling lightheaded or dizzy, nausea, blurred vision, etc. In such patients, blood glucose should be checked, and if it is low, patient should be given carbohydrate such as glucose or table sugar. \nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is blood glucose testing at home for people with diabetes. It can be easily done using a glucometer. SMBG helps patients in monitoring their own health. However, there can be signif-icant difference between capillary glucose estimated with glucometers and venous glucose estimated in laboratories. Laboratory estimation is nearer the true value, but glucometer readings have easy monitoring advantage. Chronic diabetic patients should also be monitored for cataract, dyslip-idemia and renal function. Urine microalbumin estimation provides an early indication of diabetic nephropathy. Laboratory diagnostic details for diabetes may be seen from Appendix of Unit III\u2014Carbohydrates.\nAtherosclerosis is another epidemic leading to high prevalence of cardio-\nvascular diseases. This is discussed in detail in chapter 23 of Unit IV. Atherosclerosis can lead to a stable ischemic plaque or a vulnerable isch-emic plaque. The release of thrombus from a vulnerable ischemic plaque in blood vessels supplying end arteries is the main cause of an acute coronary event like myocardial infarction and also stroke. Dyslipidemia is discussed in Unit IV on Lipid Metabolism.\nWhile it has been emphasized that obesity can cause several diseases, obesity itself can be due to several diseases, such as hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Cushing\u2019s syndrome.

All energy (calories) \nis provided by three classes of nutrients: fats, carbohydrates , and proteins . Proteins also help in growth and are \nprecursors of specialized products. Besides these three macronutrients, micronutrients  (vitamins and minerals) are \nalso required for optimal health and growth.\n There is a specific requirement of these nutrients, and a diet which provides all of them in appropriate quantities \nis known as balanced diet . Failure to adhere to balanced diet can lead to either undernutrition  or overnutrition . \nEarlier, undernutrition was a major health concern, but overnutrition, leading to overweight  and obesity  is also a health \nconcern now. Changes in food habits, with more intake of processed food have lead to situation where obesity (due to overnutrition) and micronutrient deficiency coexist.\n Vitamins  are chemically unrelated organic compounds that cannot be synthesized in adequate quantities by \nhumans and, therefore, must be supplied by the diet or obtained from intestinal flora. Vitamins can broadly be classified as water soluble  or fat soluble . Vitamins are required to perform specific cellular functions. For example, many of \nthe water-soluble vitamins are precursors of coenzymes for the enzymes of intermediary metabolism. Water-soluble vitamins can be excreted in urine, so their excess intake is not associated with toxicity. However, fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in larger amounts and excess can lead to toxicity. \n Minerals  are inorganic substances (elements) required in small amounts by the body. They function in a number of \nprocesses including formation of bones and teeth, fluid balance, nerve conduction, muscle contraction, signaling, and catalysis. Several minerals are essential enzyme cofactors. Deficiency of minerals can affect several critical processes and produce deficiency disease, e.g., iron deficiency is a very common treatable cause of anemia, calcium deficiency is common and can lead to bone deformities, etc.\n This unit will cover various macro- and micronutrients, their biochemical role, daily requirement, sources and \ndiseases associated with deficiency/excess.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   496 24-10-2020   12:11:47"

All energy (calories) is provided by three classes of nutri-ents: fats, carbohydrates, and protein (\nFig. 31.1 ). Because the intake of \nthese energy-rich molecules is larger (g amounts) than that of the other dietary nutrients, they are called macronutrients. Energy requirements of an individual depend on many variables, including age, gender, state of growth, disease, etc. Deficiency or excess of any nutrient can cause disease. Balanced diet provides the energy as well as macro- and micro-nutrients in proper proportions to maintain health. This chapter focuses on the kinds and amounts of macronutrients that are needed to maintain optimal health and prevent chronic disease. Those nutrients needed in lesser amounts (mg or \u03bcg), vitamins and minerals, are called micronutrients \nand are considered in Chapters 32 and 33.\nII. DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES\nCommittees of U.S. and Canadian experts organized by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences have compiled Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), which are esti-mates of the amounts of nutrients required to prevent deficiencies and main-tain optimal health and growth. The DRI expands on the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which have been published with periodic revi-sions since 1941. Unlike the RDA, the DRI establishes upper limits on the consumption of some nutrients and incorporates the role of nutrients in life-long health, going beyond deficiency diseases. Both the DRI and the RDA refer to long-term average daily nutrient intakes, because it is not neces-sary to consume the full RDA every day.Learning Objectives\nAt end of the chapter, student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the importance of various dietary components and dietary fiber\n\u2022 Describe types and causes of protein energy malnutrition and its effects \nFigure 31.1\nEssential nutrients obtained from the \ndiet.

Definition\nThe DRI consists of four dietary reference standards for the intake of \nnutrients designated for specific life stage (age) groups, physiologic states, and gender (\nFig. 31.2 ).\n 1. Estimated average requirement (EAR):  The average daily nutrient \nlevel estimated to fulfil the requirement of half of the healthy individ-uals (50%) of a particular age, gender, and life stage is the EAR.\n 2. Recommended dietary allowance:  The average daily nutrient \nlevel estimated to fulfil the requirement of 97%\u201398% individuals of a particular age, gender, and life stage is RDA. It is 2 standard devi-ations (SDs) above the EAR. (that is, RDA = EAR + 2 SD\nEAR).\n 3. Adequate intake (AI):  This is based on nutrient intake by a group \nof apparently healthy individuals. AI is used when sufficient scien-tific data are not available to calculate and EAR or RDA.\nFor example, the AI for young infants, for whom human milk is the \nrecommended sole source of food for the first 6 months, is based on the estimated daily mean nutrient intake supplied by human milk for healthy, full-term infants who are exclusively breast-fed.\n 4. Tolerable upper intake level (UL, or TUL):  It is the highest average \ndaily intake level with which there is no risk of any adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population.\nAs intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse \neffects may increase. The UL is useful because of the increased availability of fortified foods and the increased use of dietary supple-ments. For some nutrients, there may be insufficient data on which to develop a UL.\nB. Using the dietary reference intakes\nMost nutrients have a set of DRI ( Fig. 31.3 ). Usually a nutrient has an \nEAR and a corresponding RDA. Most are set by age and gender and may be influenced by special factors, such as pregnancy and lactation in women (see p. 514). When the data are not sufficient to estimate an EAR (or an RDA), an AI is designated. Intakes below the EAR need to be improved because the probability of adequacy is \u226450% (\nFig. 31.4 ). \nIntakes between the EAR and RDA likely need to be improved because the probability of adequacy is <98%, and intakes at or above the RDA can be considered adequate. Intakes above the AI can be considered adequate. Intakes between the UL and the RDA can be considered to have no risk for adverse effects. [Note: Because the DRI is designed to meet the nutritional needs of the healthy, it does not include any special needs of the sick.]\nIII. ENERGY REQUIREMENT IN HUMANS\nThe Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) is the average dietary energy intake predicted to maintain an energy balance (that is, the calories consumed are equal to the energy expended) in a healthy adult of a defined age, gender, and height whose weight and level of physical activity are consistent with good health.

However, some simple approximations can provide useful estimates. \n\u2022 Sedentary adults require 30 kcal/kg/day\u2022 Moderately active adults require 35 kcal/kg/day\u2022 Very active adults require 40 kcal/kg/day\nA. Energy content of food\nTo plan a proper diet, it is important to know the energy content of \nfood. The energy content of food is calculated from the heat released by the total combustion of food in a calorimeter. It is expressed in kilo-calories (kcal, or Cal). The standard conversion factors for determining the metabolic caloric value of fat, protein, and carbohydrate are shown in \nFigure 31.5 . Note that the energy content of fat is more than twice \nthat of carbohydrate or protein, whereas the energy content of ethanol is intermediate between those of fat and carbohydrate. [Note: The joule (J) is a unit of energy widely used in countries other than the United States. One cal = 4.2 J; 1 kcal = 1,000 cal = 4.2 kJ. For uniformity, many scientists are promoting the use of joules rather than calories in the United States. However, kcal still predominates and is used throughout this text.]\nCalorimeter provides the physical energy content of food, \nas food undergoes complete combustion. However, in the human body, food is broken down in several stages, during which a comparably very small amount of energy is released. This energy, known as physiological energy, is lesser than the physical energy of food.\nB. Use of food energy in the body\nThe energy generated by metabolism of the macronutrients is used for \nthree energy-requiring processes that occur in the body: resting meta-bolic rate (RMR), physical activity, and the thermic effect of food. The number of kcal expended by these processes in a 24-hour period is the total energy expenditure (TEE).\n 1. Resting metabolic rate:  RMR is defined as the energy required by \nthe body in a resting, postabsorptive condition. It represents the energy required to carry out the normal body functions, such as respiration, blood flow, and ion transport. When RMR is estimated for 24 hours, it is called resting energy expenditure (REE) .\nRMR can be determined by measuring oxygen consumed or carbon \ndioxide produced. RMR reflects lean muscle mass, and can be esti-mated factoring in sex, age, height, and weight. A commonly used rough estimate for RMR is 1 kcal/kg/hour for men and 0.9 kcal/kg/hour for women. RMR  is about 10% higher than BMR.\nBasal metabolic rate (BMR)  is measured in more stringent condi-\ntions, such as in the morning after an overnight fast, no exercise for the previous 24 hours, free from emotional stress, familiar with the apparatus, and the subject completely rested. It is not measured routinely.Figure 31.3\nDietary Reference Intakes for vitamins and minerals in individuals age 1 year and older.

REE contributes to 60%\u201375% of TEE in sedentary individuals. As disease conditions are hypercat-abolic states, RMR is multiplied by an injury factor that ranges from 1.0 (mild infection) to 2.0 (severe burns) in calculating their TEE.\nRespiratory quotient: Respiratory quotient, (RQ), is defined as \nthe volume of carbon dioxide released over the volume of oxygen absorbed during respiration. It is a dimensionless number used in calculation for BMR. \nAs the food is metabolized for energy, oxygen is consumed, and \ncarbon dioxide is produced. This uptake of oxygen is measured by a process known as indirect calorimetry.\nCarbohydrates are oxidized through aerobic respiration resulting \nin an equal ratio of CO\n2 release and oxygen consumption, there-\nfore RQ for carbohydrates is 1. Fats undergo beta-oxidation to form acetyl CoA which does not generate carbon dioxide. Therefore, when using fats over carbohydrates as a form of fuel, less CO\n2 is \ngenerated for every oxygen consumed. The RQ for fats and proteins is 0.71 and 0.84, respectively (\nFig. 31.6 ).\n 2. Physical activity:  Muscular activity provides the greatest variation \nin the TEE. The amount of energy consumed depends on the dura-tion and intensity of the exercise. This energy cost is expressed as a multiple of the RMR (range is 1.1 to >8.0) that is referred to as the physical activity ratio (PAR) or the metabolic equivalent of the task (MET). In general, a lightly active person requires ~30%\u201350% more calories than the RMR (see \nFig. 31.7 ), whereas a highly active indi-\nvidual may require \u2265100% calories above the RMR.\n 3.

PROXIMATE PRINCIPLES OF FOOD\nCarbohydrates, fats and proteins are the three proximate principles of food. \nThese are also known as macronutrients as they provide energy. Besides providing energy, these components also have many other structural and functional roles. \nA.  Acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges\nAcceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) are defined as \na range of intakes for a particular macronutrient that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate amounts of essential nutrients. \nThe AMDR for adults is (\nFig. 31.8 ):\n\u2022 45%\u201365% of total calories from carbohydrates\u2022 20%\u201335% of total calories from fats\u2022 10%\u201335% of total calories from proteins\nThe biologic properties of dietary fat, carbohydrate, and protein are \ndescribed below.\nV. DIETARY FATS\nFats are a concentrated source of energy. They provide texture and palat-ability to the food. They are also required for intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) constitute about 90% of dietary fat, with smaller amounts of cholesterol, phospholipids, glycolipids, etc. The type of fatty acid in TAG with respect to number of double bonds (satu-rated vs mono and polyunsaturated), position of double bonds ( \u03c9-3 vs \u03c9-6) \nand configuration (trans vs cis) are important features which affect the influ-ence of TAG on blood lipids.\nThe incidence of a number of chronic diseases is significantly influenced \nby the kinds and amounts of nutrients consumed (\nFig. 31.9 ). Dietary fats \nmost strongly influence the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), but evidence linking dietary fat and the risk for cancer or obesity is much weaker.\nEarlier recommendations emphasized decreasing the total \namount of dietary fat. Unfortunately, this resulted in increased consumption of refined grains and added sugars. Data now show that the type of fat is a more important risk factor than the total amount of fat.\nA. Plasma lipids and coronary heart disease\nPlasma cholesterol may arise from the diet or from endogenous biosyn-\nthesis. In either case, cholesterol is transported between the tissues in combination with protein and phospholipids as lipoproteins.\n 1. Low-density and high-density lipoproteins:  The level of plasma \ncholesterol is not precisely regulated but, rather, varies in response to diet. Elevated levels of total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) result in an increased risk for CHD (\nFig. 31.10 ).

As LDL-C increases, CHD increases. In contrast, elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with a decreased risk for heart disease (see p. 359). [Note: Elevated plasma triacylglyc-erol (TAG) is associated with CHD, but a causative relationship has yet to be demonstrated.] Abnormal levels of plasma lipids (dyslipid-emias) act in combination with smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, insulin resistance, and other risk factors to increase the risk of CHD.\n 2. Benefits of lowering plasma cholesterol:  Dietary or drug treat-\nment of hypercholesterolemia has been shown to be effective in decreasing LDL-C, increasing HDL-C, and reducing the risk for cardiovascular events. The diet-induced changes in plasma choles-terol concentrations are modest, typically 10%\u201320%, whereas treat-ment with statin drugs decreases plasma cholesterol by 30%\u201360% (see p. 347). [Note: Dietary and drug treatment can also lower TAG.]\nB. Dietary fats and plasma lipids\nTAGs are quantitatively the most important class of dietary fats. The influence of TAG on blood lipids is determined by the chemical nature of their constituent fatty acids. The absence or presence and number of double bonds (saturated versus mono- and polyunsaturated), the location of the double bonds ( \u03c9-6 versus \u03c9-3), and the cis versus trans \nconfiguration of the unsaturated fatty acids are the most important structural features that influence blood lipids.\n 1. Saturated fats:  TAG composed primarily of fatty acids whose hydro-\ncarbon chains do not contain any double bonds are referred to as saturated fats. Consumption of saturated fats is positively associ-ated with high levels of total plasma cholesterol and LDL-C and an increased risk of CHD. The main sources of saturated fatty acids are dairy and meat products and some vegetable oils, such as coconut and palm oils (a major source of fat in Latin America and Asia, although not in the United States). Many experts strongly advise limiting intake of saturated fats to <10% of total caloric intake and replacing them with unsaturated fats (and whole grains).\nSaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 14 (myristic) \nand 16 (palmitic) are most potent in increasing the plasma cholesterol level. Stearic acid (18 carbons, found in many foods including chocolate) has little effect on blood cholesterol.\n 2. Monounsaturated fats:  TAG containing primarily fatty acids with \none double bond are referred to as monounsaturated fats. These are important components of membrane structural lipids, particu-larly in nervous tissue myelin. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are generally obtained from plant-based oils. When substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet, MUFA lower both total plasma cholesterol and LDL-C and maintain or increase HDL-C. This ability of MUFA to favorably modify lipoprotein levels may explain, in part, the observation that Mediterranean cultures, with diets rich in olive oil (high in monounsaturated oleic acid), show a low incidence of Figure 31.9\nInfluence of nutrition on some common \ncauses of death in the United States in the year 2010.

The Mediterranean diet:  The Mediterranean diet is an example \nof a diet rich in MUFA (from olive oil) and polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFA (from fish oils, plant oils, and some nuts) but low in saturated fat. For example, \nFigure 31.11  shows the composition \nof the Mediterranean diet in comparison with both a Western diet similar to that consumed in the United States and a typical low-fat diet. The Mediterranean diet contains seasonally fresh food, with an abundance of plant material, low amounts of red meat, and olive oil as the principal source of fat. The Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C, decreased TAG, and increased HDL-C when compared with a typical Western diet higher in saturated fats.\n 3. Polyunsaturated fats:  TAG containing primarily fatty acids with \nmore than one double bond are referred to as polyunsaturated fats. Depending on the location of the double bond, PUFA can be \u03c9-3 or \n\u03c9-6. The effects of PUFA on cardiovascular disease are influenced \nby the location of the double bonds within the molecule.\n a. \ud835\udf88-6 Fatty acids:  These are long-chain PUFA, with the first \ndouble bond beginning at the sixth bond position when starting from the methyl ( \u03c9) end of the fatty acid molecule. [Note: They \nare also called n-6 fatty acids (see p. 299).] Consumption of fats containing \u03c9-6 PUFA, principally linoleic acid (18:2 [9,12]), \nobtained from vegetable oils, lowers plasma cholesterol when substituted for saturated fats. Plasma LDL-C is lowered, but HDL-C, which protects against CHD, is also lowered, partially offsetting the benefits of lowering LDL-C. Nuts, avocados, olives, soybeans, and various oils, including sunflower and corn oil, are common sources of these fatty acids. The AMDR for linoleic acid is 5%\u201310%. [Note: The lower recommendation for intake of PUFA relative to MUFA is because of concern that free radical\u2013mediated oxidation (peroxidation) of PUFA may lead to deleterious products.]\n\u2013OOC\nH3C\u2013OOC\nH3C\nLinoleic acid\n(18:2,    -6)- Linolenic acid\n(18:3,    -3)\n b. \ud835\udf88-3 Fatty acids:  The AMDR for \u03b1-linolenic acid is 0.6%\u20131.2%. \nFor patients with documented CHD, 1 g/day of fish oil is recom-mended while 2\u20134 g/day is recommended to lower TAG.\nThese are long-chain PUFA, with the first double bond begin-\nning at the third bond position from the methyl ( \u03c9) end. Dietary \n\u03c9-3 PUFA suppress cardiac arrhythmias, reduce plasma TAG, \ndecrease the tendency for thrombosis, lower blood pres-sure, and substantially reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality (\nFig. 31.12 ), but they have little effect on LDL-C or HDL-C levels. \nEvidence suggests that they have anti-inflammatory effects.

Fish \noil contains the long-chain \u03c9-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, \n22:6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5). Two fatty fish (for example, salmon) meals per week are recommended. For patients with documented CHD, 1 g/day of fish oils is recom-mended, while 2\u20134 g/day is prescribed to lower TAG. DHA is a structural constituent of membranes specifically in the central nervous system. DHA is known to promote brain development. Since endogenous production of DHA is relatively low, it is included in infant formulas. Linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic acids are \nessential fatty acids (EFA) required for membrane fluidity and synthesis of eicosanoids (see p. 331). EFA deficiency, caused primarily by fat malabsorption, is characterized by scaly derma-titis as a result of the depletion of skin ceramides with long-chain fatty acids (see p. 326).\n 4. Trans fatty acids:  Trans fatty acids (\nFig. 31.13 ) are unsaturated \nfatty acids which contain at least one double bond in the trans configuration. These are chemically classified as unsaturated fatty acids but behave more like saturated fatty acids in the body because they elevate LDL-C and lower HDL-C, thereby increasing the risk of CHD. Trans fatty acids do not occur naturally in plants but occur in small amounts in animals. However, trans fatty acids \nare formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils (for example, in the manufacture of margarine and partially hydrogenated vege-table oil). Trans fatty acids are a major component of many commer-cial baked goods, such as cookies, and most deep-fried foods. Many manufacturers have reformulated their products to be free of trans fats. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required that Nutrition Facts labels (see p. 512) portray the trans fat content of packaged food. By 2018, virtually no industrial trans fatty acids will be permitted in food.\n 5. Dietary cholesterol:  Cholesterol is found only in animal products. \nThe effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma cholesterol (\nFig. 31.14 ) is \nless important than the amount and types of fatty acids consumed. Many experts recommend \u2264300 mg/day. However, having an upper limit has become controversial.\nC. Other dietary factors affecting coronary heart disease\nModerate consumption of alcohol (up to 1 drink/day for women and up to 2 drinks/day for men) decreases the risk of CHD, because there is a positive correlation between moderate alcohol (ethanol) consump-tion and the plasma concentration of HDL-C. However, because of the potential dangers of alcohol abuse, health professionals are reluctant to recommend increased alcohol consumption to their patients. Red wine may provide cardioprotective benefits in addition to those resulting from its alcohol content (for example, red wine contains phenolic compounds that inhibit lipoprotein oxidation; see p. 358). [Note: These antioxidants are also present in raisins and grape juice.] \nFigure 31.15 \nsummarizes the effects of dietary fats.

The rising incidence of obesity has coincided with increased carbohydrate consumption (as fat consump-tion decreased), leading some observers to link obesity with carbohydrate consumption. However, obesity has also been related to increasingly inac-tive lifestyles and to calorie-dense foods served in expanded portion size. Carbohydrates are not inherently fattening.\nA. Dietary carbohydrates can be of two types.\n 1. Digestible carbohydrates: These can be digested and utilized for \nenergy production. Examples are starch, sucrose, etc.\n 2. Indigestible carbohydrates:  These cannot be digested, hence do \nnot provide energy. These are useful as dietary fibers. Examples are cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, and lignin.\n a.

In the United States, HFCS 55 (containing 55% fructose and 42% glucose) is commonly used as a substitute for sucrose in beverages, including soft drinks, with HFCS 42 used in processed foods. The composition and metabolism of HFCS and sucrose are similar, the major difference being that HFCS is ingested as a mixture of monosaccharides (\nFig. 31.16 ). \nMost studies have shown no significant difference between sucrose and HFCS meals in either postprandial glucose or insulin responses.

Dietary fibers:  Dietary fibers are carbohydrates that are not \ndigested in the small intestine and do not provide energy.\n  These include soluble fibers (cellulose and lignin) and insol-\nuble fibers (pectins). Fiber can absorb 10\u201315 times its own weight in water, drawing fluid into the lumen of the intestine and promoting bowel motility. Soluble fibers are completely or partially fermented by bacteria to short-chain fatty acids in the large intestine. Insoluble fibers pass through the large intestine unchanged. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes are rich in fibers.\n  Dietary fibers are an important component of diet.\nii. Advantages of fiber\n\u2022 Dietary fiber retains water, absorbing 10\u201315 times its own \nweight in water, adding bulk to the stool and softening it, making it easier to pass (\nFig. 31.17 ).\n\u2022 A high-fiber diet lowers risk of developing constipation, \nhemorrhoids and diverticulosis.\n\u2022 Fiber delays gastric emptying, resulting in a sensation of \nsatiety. Delayed emptying can also reduce spikes in post-meal blood glucose.\n\u2022 Dietary fiber interferes with intestinal bile acid reabsorp-\ntion, reducing cholesterol and LDL levels. This reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (see p. 348). For example, diets rich (25\u201350 g/day) in the soluble fibers such as oat bran are associated with a modest, but significant reduc-tion in risk for CHD by lowering total cholesterol and LDL-C levels.\n\u2022 A high-fiber diet likely lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. \nIncreasing bowel motility reduces the exposure time of the intestine to carcinogens.\n  The AI for dietary fiber is 25 g/day for women and 38 g/day \nfor men. However, traditional Indian diets are high-fiber diets. However, nowadays urban diets are rich in processed food and have far lower fiber content. [Note: \u201cFunctional fiber\u201d is the term used for isolated fiber that has proven health bene-fits such as commercially available fiber supplements.]\nB. Dietary carbohydrate and blood glucose\nSome carbohydrate-containing foods produce a rapid rise followed by a steep fall in blood glucose concentration, whereas others result in a gradual rise followed by a slow decline (\nFig. 31.18 ). Thus, they differ in \ntheir glycemic response (GR). [Note: Fiber blunts the GR.] \nGlycemic index (GI)  is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates \non blood glucose levels. It ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0\u2013100. Glycemic load is calculated as the area under the 2-hour blood glucose response curve after ingestion of 50 g of carbohydrate. Glycemic load of a food, compared with glycemic load of standard (glucose/white bread) gives the GI.SMALL\nINTESTINEto\nLIVERMOUTH\nPANCREASSTOMACHSTOMACH\nSucrase\nSMALL\nINTESTINEto\nLIVERMOUTH\nPANCREASSTOMACHSTOMACHA\nBSUCROSE\nHFCS 55Fructose \n50%Glucose \n50%\nFructose \n55%Glucose \n42%\nOther sugars 3%\nFigure 31.16\nDigestion of sucrose (A) or high-fructose \ncorn syrup (HFCS) 55 (B) leads to absorption of glucose plus fructose.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   506 24-10-2020   12:11:52"

Food with a low GI tends to create a sense of satiety over a longer period of time and may be helpful in limiting caloric intake. [Note: How much a typical serving size of a food raises blood glucose is referred to as the glycemic load. A food (for example, carrots) can have a high GI and a low glycemic load.]\n 1. Foods with high GI:  White wheat bread, whole wheat/whole meal \nbread, corn flakes, rice porridge, oats porridge, boiled potatoes, boiled white rice. \n 2. Foods with low GI:  Barley, spaghetti, tortilla, boiled carrot, kidney \nbeans, chickpeas, soybeans, milk (full fat/skimmed).\nC. Carbohydrate requirements\nCarbohydrates are not essential nutrients, because the carbon skele-tons of most amino acids can be converted into glucose (see p. 396). However, the absence of dietary carbohydrate leads to ketogenesis (see p. 313) and degradation of body protein whose constituent amino acids provide carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis (see p. 217). The RDA for carbohydrate is set at 130 g/day for adults and children, based on the amount of glucose used by carbohydrate-dependent tissues, such as the brain and erythrocytes. However, this level of intake is usually exceeded. Adults should consume 45%\u201365% of their total calories from carbohydrates. It is now recommended that added sugars repre-sent no more than 10% of total energy intake because of concerns that they may displace nutrient-rich foods from the diet. The added sugars are also associated with increased body weight and type 2 diabetes.\nD. Simple sugars and disease\nThere is no direct evidence that the consumption of simple sugars naturally present in food is harmful. Contrary to folklore, diets high in sucrose do not lead to diabetes or hypoglycemia. Also contrary to popular belief, carbohydrates are not inherently fattening. They yield 4 kcal/g (the same as protein and less than one half that of fat; see \nFig. 31.5 ) and result in fat synthesis only when consumed in excess \nof the body\u2019s energy needs. However, there is an association between sucrose consumption and dental caries, particularly in the absence of fluoride treatment (see p. 560).\nVII. DIETARY PROTEIN\nThe AMDR for protein is 10%\u201335%. Dietary protein provides the essential amino acids (see Fig. 25.2, p. 397). Nine of the 20 amino acids needed for the synthesis of body proteins are essential (that is, they cannot be synthe-sized in humans).\nA. Protein quality\nThe quality of a dietary protein is a measure of its ability to provide the essential amino acids (EAA) required for tissue maintenance. Most government agencies have adopted the Protein Digestibility\u2013Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) as the standard by which to evaluate \nHealth effects\nDecreases plasma cholesterol by\nincreasing bile acid excretionin stool\nDelays gastric emptying\nGenerates sensation of fullnessReduces postprandial blood    glucose concentration\nIncreases bowel motility*Softens stool; reduces risk for\nconstipation, hemorrhoids, anddiverticula\nFigure 31.17\nActions of dietary fiber.

The highest possible score under these guidelines is 1.00. This amino acid score provides a method to balance intakes of poorer-quality proteins with high-quality dietary proteins.\nBiological value\nThe biological value provides a measurement of how efficient \nthe body utilizes protein consumed in the diet. It is estimated by calculating the nitrogen used for tissue formation divided by the nitrogen absorbed from food. A food with a high value correlates to a high supply of the essential amino acids.\nBiological value = \nNitrogen retained\nNitrogen absorbed \u00d7 100\nSome Other Measures of Protein Quality\n(a) Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) = Gain in body weight (g)\nProtein fed (g)\n Animal proteins have high PER (2.5) and plant proteins \nhave low PER (between 0.5 and 2.5).\n(b) Chemical Score = mg of limiting amino acid \nin 1 gram test protein\nmg of same amino acid in \n1 gram of reference protein \u00d7 100\n Egg protein has a chemical score of 100 and is consid-\nered a reference protein.\n(c) Net Protein Utilization (NPU) = Nitrogen retained\nIntake of nitrogen \u00d7 100\n 1. Proteins from animal sources:  Proteins from animal sources (meat, \npoultry, milk, and fish) have a high quality because they contain all the EAA in proportions similar to those required for synthesis of human tissue proteins (\nFig. 31.19 ), and they are more readily digested. \n[Note: Gelatin prepared from animal collagen is an exception. It has a low biologic value as a result of deficiencies in several EAA.]\n 2. Proteins from plant sources:  Plant proteins have a lower quality \nthan do animal proteins. However, proteins from different plant sources may be combined in such a way that the result is equiva-lent in nutritional value to animal protein. This is known as mutual supplementation (see box). Animal proteins can also complement the biologic value of plant proteins.\nLimiting amino acids\nIn any food, the essential amino acid which is in smallest quantity is known as limiting amino acid. Most \nplant-based proteins have a limiting amino acid. Protein synthesis is limited by the rate at which this limiting amino acid is available. For example, for wheat and rice, lysine is the limiting amino acid; for maize, lysine and tryptophan are limiting amino acids. \nTo overcome this limit, two incomplete proteins can be combined to produce a complete protein. This \nis known as mutual supplementation . For example, wheat (lysine deficient but methionine rich) can be \ncombined with kidney beans (lysine rich but methionine deficient) to provide all essential amino acids (\nFig 31.20 ). For vegetables, methionine is a limiting amino acid but combining them with grains or nuts can \nprovide complete protein.Amount of essential amino acid\n(percent of dietary requirements)0Beans Wheat Beans\n+\nWheat\n(1:1)Lysine\nMethionine + cysteine50100150\nNeed \nmore\nFigure 31.20\nCombining two incomplete proteins \nthat have complementary amino acid deficiencies results in a mixture with a higher biologic value.Source\nAnimal proteins\n Egg\n Milk protein Beef/poultry/fish GelatinPDCAAS\nvalue\n 1.00\n1.00\n0.82\u20130.92\n0.08\nPlant proteins\n Soybean protein Kidney beans Whole wheat bread1.00\n0.680.40\nFigure 31.19\nRelative quality of some common \ndietary proteins.

Nitrogen balance\nNitrogen balance occurs when the amount of nitrogen consumed \nequals that of the nitrogen excreted in the urine (primarily as urinary urea nitrogen, or UUN), sweat, and feces. Most healthy adults are normally in nitrogen balance. [Note: There is, on average, 1 g nitrogen in 6.25 g protein.]\n 1. Positive nitrogen balance:  This occurs when nitrogen intake \nexceeds nitrogen excretion. It is observed during situations in which tissue growth occurs, for example, in childhood, pregnancy, or during recovery from an emaciating illness.\n 2. Negative nitrogen balance:  This occurs when nitrogen loss is \ngreater than nitrogen intake. It is associated with inadequate dietary protein; lack of an essential amino acid; or during physiologic stresses, such as trauma, burns, illness, or surgery.\nNitrogen (N) balance (g N in \u2013 g N out) in a 24-hour period can \nbe determined by the formula, N balance = protein intake in g/6.25 \u2013 (UUN + 4 g), where 4 g accounts for urinary loss in forms other than UUN plus loss in skin and feces.\nC. Protein requirements\nThe amount of dietary protein required in the diet varies with its biologic \nvalue. The greater the proportion of animal protein in the diet, the less protein is required. The RDA for protein is computed for proteins of mixed biologic value at 0.8 g/kg of body weight for adults, or ~56 g of protein for a 70-kg individual. People who exercise strenuously on a regular basis may benefit from extra protein to maintain muscle mass, and a daily intake of ~1 g/kg has been recommended for athletes. Women who are pregnant or lactating require up to 30 g/day in addi-tion to their basal requirements. To support growth, infants should consume 2 g/kg/day. [Note: Disease states influence protein needs. Protein restriction may be needed in kidney disease, whereas burns require increased protein intake.]\n 1. Consumption of excess protein:  There is no physiologic advan-\ntage to the consumption of more protein than the RDA. Protein consumed in excess of the body\u2019s needs is deaminated, and the resulting carbon skeletons are metabolized to provide energy or acetyl coenzyme A for fatty acid synthesis. When excess protein is eliminated from the body as urinary nitrogen, it is often accom-panied by increased urinary calcium, thereby increasing the risk of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and osteoporosis.\n 2. The protein-sparing effect of carbohydrates:  The dietary protein \nrequirement is influenced by the carbohydrate content of the diet. When the intake of carbohydrates is low, amino acids are deami-nated to provide carbon skeletons for the synthesis of glucose that is needed as a fuel by the central nervous system. If carbohydrate intake is <130 g/day, substantial amounts of protein are metabo-lized to provide precursors for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, carbo-hydrate is considered to be \u201cprotein-sparing,\u201d because it allows amino acids to be used for repair and maintenance of tissue protein rather than for gluconeogenesis.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   509 24-10-2020   12:11:53"

Protein-energy (calorie) malnutrition\nProtein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a spectrum of conditions caused \nby protein and/or energy deficiencies. In developed countries, protein-energy malnutrition, also known as protein-energy undernutrition (PEU), is most commonly seen in patients with medical conditions that decrease appetite or alter how nutrients are digested or absorbed or in hospitalized patients with major trauma or infections. [Note: Such highly catabolic patients frequently require intravenous (IV, or paren-teral) or tube-based (enteral) administration of nutrients.] PEM may also be seen in children or the elderly who are malnourished. In devel-oping countries, an inadequate intake of protein and/or calories is the primary cause of PEM. Affected individuals show a variety of symp-toms, including a depressed immune system with a reduced ability to resist infection. Death from secondary infection is common. PEM is a spectrum of degrees of malnutrition, and two extreme forms are kwash-iorkor and marasmus (\nFig. 31.21 ). [Note: Marasmic kwashiorkor has \nfeatures of both forms.]\nPEM is caused by deficient intake or absorption of food \n(anorexia, oral intake restriction, malabsorption, etc) or due to conditions associated with increased energy requirements (growth, infection, trauma, cancer, etc). In children, under-nutrition is often termed failure to thrive, in which a child fails to gain weight or linear growth or head circumference appropriately.\n 1. Kwashiorkor:  Kwashiorkor occurs when protein deprivation is rela-\ntively greater than the reduction in total calories. Protein depriva-tion is associated with severely decreased synthesis of visceral protein. Kwashiorkor is commonly seen in developing countries in children after weaning at about age 1 year, when their diet consists predominantly of carbohydrates or when there is very less gap in successive pregnancies. Typical symptoms include stunted growth, skin lesions, depigmented hair, anorexia, fatty liver, bilateral pitting edema, and decreased serum albumin concentration. Edema results from the lack of adequate blood proteins, primarily albumin, to maintain the distribution of water between blood and tissues. It may mask muscle and fat loss. The child has a plump appear-ance due to edema. Therefore, chronic malnutrition is reflected in the level of serum albumin. Nutritional repletion restores hair color, leaving a band of hair with altered pigmentation followed by a band with normal pigmentation (flag sign). \nKwashiorkor\nMarasmus60\u201380\n<60Normal or \u00d8\n  Markedly \u00d8Present\nAbsent\u00d8\nMarkedly \u00d8Type of PEM Weight for age (% expected)Weight for\nheightEdemaMuscle and\nfat content\nFigure 31.21\nPhysical features of extreme protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in children.

Kwashiorkor is, therefore, nonadapted malnutrition.]\n 2. Marasmus:  Marasmus occurs when calorie deprivation is relatively \ngreater than the reduction in protein. It usually occurs in developing countries in children younger than age 1 year when breast milk is supplemented or replaced with watery gruels of native cereals that are usually deficient in both protein and calories. Typical symptoms include arrested growth, extreme muscle wasting and depletion of subcutaneous fat (emaciation), weakness, and anemia (\nFig. 31.22 ). \nIndividuals with marasmus do not show the edema observed in kwashiorkor. [Note: Refeeding severely malnourished individuals can result in hypophosphatemia (see p. 553), because any avail-able phosphate is used to phosphorylate carbohydrate intermedi-ates. Milk is frequently given because it is rich in phosphate.]\nCachexia, a wasting disorder characterized by loss of appe-\ntite and muscle atrophy (with or without increased lipolysis) that cannot be reversed by conventional nutritional support, is seen with a number of chronic diseases, such as cancer and chronic pulmonary and renal disease. It is associated with decreased treatment tolerance and response and decreased survival time.\nVIII. NUTRITION TOOLS\nA set of tools has been developed that gives consumers information about \nwhat (and how much) they should eat as well as the nutritional content of the foods they do eat. Additional tools allow medical professionals to assess whether or not the nutritional needs of an individual are being met.\nA. MyPlate\nMyPlate was designed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to graphically illustrate its recommendations as to what food groups and how much of each should be consumed daily. In MyPlate, the rela-tive amounts of each of five food groups (vegetables, grains, protein, fruit, and dairy) are represented by the relative size of their section on the plate (\nFig. 31.23 ). The number of servings depends on variables \nthat include age and sex. [Note: MyPlate replaced MyPyramid in 2011.]\nB. Nutrition facts label\nMost types of packaged goods are required to have a Nutrition Facts label, or \u201cfood label\u201d (\nFig. 31.24 ), that includes the size of a single \nserving, the Cal it provides, and the number of servings per container. In addition, a percent daily value (%DV) is shown for most nutrients listed. [Note: The %DV is based on a 2,000-Cal diet for healthy adults.]\n 1. Percent daily value:  The %DV compares the amount of a given \nnutrient in a single serving of a product to the recommended daily intake for that nutrient. For example, the %DV for the micronutrients listed, as well as for total carbohydrates and fiber, are based on their recommended minimum daily intake. Thus, if the label lists 20% for \nA\nB\nFigure 31.22\nA. Listless child with kwashiorkor. Note \nthe swollen belly and lower legs. B.

In contrast, the %DV for satu-rated fat, cholesterol, and sodium are based on their recommended maximum daily intake, and the %DV reflects what percentage of this maximum a serving provides. There is no %DV for protein because the recommended intake depends on body weight (see p. 509). [Note: \u201cSugars\u201d represents mono- and disaccharides. The remainder of the carbohydrate (total carbohydrate \u2013 [fiber + sugars]) is the oligo- and polysaccharides.]\n 2. Proposed revisions:  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of \nIndia (FSSAI), in 2019, proposed to make it mandatory to display red color-coding on front-of-the-pack labels on packaged food products that have high-fat, high-sugar and high-salt content levels.\nC. Nutrition assessment\nEvaluation of nutritional status on the basis of clinical information is nutritional assessment. This assessment can help in identifying patients who can benefit from nutritional therapy, that is the change in diet for treatment of disease conditions (for example, replacement of long-chain TAG with medium-chain TAG in malabsorption disorders) and/or the method of intake (for example, enteral [tube] or parenteral [IV] feeding). The assessment includes:\n 1. Dietary history:  This is the record of food intake over a period of \ntime. Food diary can be used to record specific types and amount of food eaten for a period of 3\u20137 days. Food frequency question-naire and 24-hour recall of specific foods can also be used.\n 2. Anthropometric measures:  These are the physical measurements \nof the body. These include weight, height, body mass index (BMI), skin fold thickness of triceps or subscapular (indicator of subcuta-neous fat), and waist circumference (an indicator of abdominal fat).\n 3. Laboratory data:  These are obtained by tests performed on body \nfluids, tissues, and waste. They can include plasma LDL-C (for cardiovascular risk), fecal fat (for malabsorption), red cell indices (for vitamin deficiencies), and N balance and serum proteins (such as albumin and transthyretin [prealbumin]) for protein\u2013energy status. [Note: These proteins are made in the liver and transport molecules such as fatty acids and thyroxine (see p. 560) through blood. Low albumin levels correlate with increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The short half-life (2\u20133 days) of transthyretin as compared to that of albumin (20 days) has led to its use in moni-toring the progress of hospitalized patients.]\nNutritional insufficiency can be the result of inadequate nutrient \nintake (caused, for example, by an inability to eat, loss of appe-tite, or decreased availability), inadequate absorption, decreased utilization, increased excretion, or increased requirements.Figure 31.23\nMyPlate.\nFigure 31.24\nNutrition Facts label (food label).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   512 24-10-2020   12:11:54"

Additionally, each stage has specific nutrition needs.\nA. Infancy, childhood, and adolescence\nThe rapid growth and development in infancy (birth to age 1 year) and childhood (age 1 year to adolescence) necessitate higher energy and protein needs relative to body size than are required in subsequent life stages. In adolescence, the marked increases in height and weight that occur increase nutritional needs. Growth charts (\nFig. 31.25 ) are \nused to compare an individual\u2019s stature (height) and/or weight to the expected values for others of the same age (\u226420 years) and sex. They are based on data from large numbers of normal individuals over time. [Note: Deviations from the expected growth curve, as reflected in the crossing of two or more percentile lines, raise concern.]\n 1. Infants:  Breast milk is ideal infant nutrition because it contains \ncalories as well as most micronutrients in appropriate quantities. Breast milk contains carbohydrates (lactose and nearly 200 unique oligosaccharides), fats and proteins in a 7:3:1 ratio. [Note: About 90% of the microbiota (the population of microbes) in the breast-fed infant\u2019s intestine is represented by one type, Bifidobacterium infantis, which expresses all the enzymes needed to degrade these complex sugars. The sugars, in turn, act as prebiotics that support the growth of B. infantis, a probiotic (helpful bacteria).] Breast milk is low in vitamin D, however, and exclusively breast-fed babies require vitamin D supplementation. [Note: Human milk provides antibodies and other proteins that reduce the risk of infection.]\nThe microbiota in and on the human body plus their genomes \nare referred to as the microbiome. It is acquired at birth from the environment and changes with the life stages. The gut microbiome influences host nutrition by facilitating processing of food consumed and is itself influenced by that food. Its relationship with undernutrition, obesity, and diabetes is under investigation.\n 2. Children:  As with infants, children have increased need for calories \nand nutrients. In children, larger proportion of protein is required for maintenance of nitrogen balance and for meeting the require-ments of growth and development of the body. Additional allow-ances for micronutrients are also required as deficiencies of iron and calcium are a concern at this stage.\n 3. Adolescents:  In the teen years, the increases in height and weight \nincrease the need for calories, protein, calcium, iron, and phos-phorus. Eating patterns in this stage can result in overconsump-tion of fat, sodium, and sugar and underconsumption of vitamin A,  \nthiamine, and folic acid.

Young adults:  Nutrition in young adults focuses on the mainte-\nnance of good health and the prevention of disease. The goal is a diet rich in plant-based foods (with a focus on fiber and whole grains), limited intake of saturated fat and trans fatty acids, and balanced intake of \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 PUFA.\n 2. Pregnant or lactating women:  The requirements for calories, \nprotein, and virtually all micronutrients increase in pregnancy and lactation. \nNutrition during pregnancy affects the growth and development of \nthe fetus and also affects the subsequent health of the offspring. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy is a good indicator of adequate nutrition. Pregnant women should increase their energy intake by 360 kcal/day in the second trimester and by 475 kcal/day in third trimester. Extra protein (1 g, 9 g, and 31 g per day in the first, second and third trimester, respectively) and micronutri-ents are also required. Supplementation with folic acid (to prevent neural tube defects), vitamin D, calcium, iron, iodine, and DHA are recommended.\nSimilarly, during lactation for extra energy, proteins and micronutri-\nents need to be included in the diet.\n 3. Older adults:  Aging increases the risk of malnutrition. Nutrient \nintake may be reduced, due to reduced sense of taste (dysgeusia) and smell (hyposmia), along with physical limitations such as dental problems. Inadequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamins D and B\n12 is common. B 12 deficiency can result from decreased absorp-\ntion caused by achlorhydria (reduced stomach acid, see p. 527). In aging, lean muscle mass decreases and fat increases, resulting in decreased RMR.

However, many popu-\nlations face a challenge in providing optimal nutrition, leading to malnu-trition, stunting and mortality, with children, pregnant and lactating women being most vulnerable. More than a third of the world\u2019s children are affected by protein energy malnutrition. In Asia, most countries have high or very high prevalence . In India, children below 6 years, and preg-\nnant and lactating mothers are given supplementary nutrition in Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme. The school children are also provided nutritious one meal under the Mid-Day Meal scheme. Along with undernutrition, overnutrition, causing obesity, also coexists. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, 39% of world\u2019s adult popula-tion were overweight and about 13% were obese. Obesity is associated with increased prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, such as Diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. The South-East Asians have a higher risk of these diseases at a lower level of obesity as compared to Western populations. Globally, excessive trans fat intake is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths of people from cardiovascular disease every year. Larger amount of trans fat in our food is contributed by industrially-produced trans-fatty acids (iTFA), which are used in baked and fried foods, pre-packaged snacks and food, and cooking oils and spreads. WHO has launched a comprehensive plan, REPLACE action package, to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fats from the global food supply by 2023.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   515 24-10-2020   12:11:55"

Chapter Summary\nThe Dietary Reference Intakes  (DRI) provide estimates of the amounts of nutrients required to prevent deficiencies \nand maintain optimal health and growth. They consist of the Estimated Average Requirement  (EAR), the average daily \nnutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of 50% of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage (age) and gender group; the Recommended Dietary Allowance  (RDA ), the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to \nmeet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%\u201398%) individuals in a life stage and gender group; the Adequate Intake  \n(AI), which is set instead of an RDA if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to calculate the RDA; and the Tolerable \nUpper Intake Level  (UL), the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health \neffects to almost all individuals in the general population. Macronutrients provide energy (9 kcal/g of fat, 4 kcal/g of protei ns \nand carbohydrates) for Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) , which comprises of three components: resting metabolic rate , \nphysical activity,  and thermic effect of food . Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges  (AMDR ) are defined as \nthe ranges of intake for a particular macronutrient that are associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate amounts of essential nutrients. Adults should consume 45%\u201365%  of their total calories  from carbohydrates , \n20%\u201335%  from fat, and 10%\u201335%  from protein  (\nFig. 31.27 ). Dietary fiber  does not provide energy but is important as it \nis protective against several diseases. Glycemic index (GI)  is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood glucose \nlevels. Diets with lower GI help in the management of blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Elevated levels of cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins (LDL-C) result in increased risk for coronary heart disease  (CHD ). In contrast, elevated levels \nof cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) have been associated with a decreased risk for CHD. Dietary or drug treatment of hypercholesterolemia  is effective in decreasing LDL-C, increasing HDL-C, and reducing the risk for CHD. \nConsumption of saturated fats  is strongly associated with high levels of total plasma and LDL-C. When substituted for \nsaturated fatty acids in the diet, monounsaturated fats  lower both total plasma cholesterol and LDL-C but maintain or \nincrease HDL-C. Consumption of fats containing \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids  lowers plasma LDL-C, but HDL-C, \nwhich protects against CHD, is also lowered. Dietary \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fats suppress cardiac arrhythmias and reduce \nplasma triacylglycerols, decrease the tendency for thrombosis, and substantially reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Carbohydrates  provide energy  and fiber  to the diet. When they are consumed as part of a diet in which caloric intake \nis equal to energy expenditure, they do not promote obesity. Dietary protein  provides essential amino acids . Protein \nquality  is a measure of its ability to provide the essential amino acids required for tissue maintenance. Proteins from \nanimal sources, in general, have a higher-quality protein than that derived from plants. However, proteins from different plant sources may be combined in such a way that the result is equivalent in nutritional value to animal protein. Positive \nnitrogen  (N) balance  occurs when N intake exceeds N excretion. It is observed in situations in which tissue growth occurs, \nfor example, in childhood, pregnancy, or during recovery from an emaciating illness. Negative N balance  occurs when \nN losses are greater than N intake. It is associated with inadequate dietary protein; lack of an essential amino acid; or during physiologic stresses such as trauma, burns, illness, or surgery. Kwashiorkor  occurs when protein deprivation is \nrelatively greater than the reduction in total calories. It is characterized by edema. Marasmus  occurs when calorie depri-\nvation is relatively greater than the reduction in protein. No edema is seen. Both are extreme forms of protein-energy \nmalnutrition  (PEM ). Nutrition Facts labels  give consumers information about the nutritional content of packaged foods. \nMedical assessment of nutritional status includes dietary history , anthropometric measures , and laboratory data . Each \nlife stage has specific nutrition needs. Growth charts  are used to monitor the growth pattern of an individual from birth \nthrough adolescence. Drug\u2013nutrient interactions  are of concern, especially in older adults. Balanced diet meets the daily \nenergy, protein, vitamin and mineral requirements. Different stages of life have their special dietary requirements. Specific diets are also required for different disease conditions.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   516 24-10-2020   12:11:55"

Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipopro-tein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.31.7. Which one of the following statements concerning \ndietary fat is correct?\nA. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, \nand olive oil is rich in saturated fats.\nB. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, \nunlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\nC. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and \nlinolenic acids are required components.\nD. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally \ncontain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals.\nCorrect answer = D. The total energy intake is (275 g \ncarbohydrate \u00d7 4 kcal/g) + (75 g protein \u00d7 4 kcal/g) + (65 g fat \u00d7 9 kcal/g) = 1,100 + 300 + 585 = 1,985 total kcal/day. The percentage of calories derived from carbohy-drate is 1,100/1,985 = 55, from protein is 300/1,985 = 15, and from fat is 585/1,985 = 30. These are very close to current recommendations. The amount of fiber or nitrogen balance cannot be deduced from the data presented. If the protein is of low biologic value, a negative nitrogen balance is possible.31.8. Given the information that a 70-kg man is \nconsuming a daily average of 275 g of carbohy-drate, 75 g of protein, and 65 g of fat, which one of the following conclusions can reasonably be drawn?\nA. About 20% of calories are derived from fats.\nB. The diet contains a sufficient amount of fiber.C. The individual is in nitrogen balance.D. The proportions of carbohydrate, protein, \nand fat in the diet conform to current recommendations.\nE. The total energy intake per day is about \n3,000 kcal.\nCorrect answer = C. A treatment goal for the chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO\n2) produced to oxygen consumed, \nthereby minimizing the production of CO 2. Less CO 2 is \nproduced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbo-hydrate. [Note: RQ is determined by indirect calorimetry.]31.9. In chronic bronchitis, excessive mucus production \ncauses airway obstruction that results in hypoxemia (low blood oxygen level), impaired expiration, and hypercapnia (carbon dioxide retention). Why might a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet be recommended for a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by chronic bronchitis?\nA. Fat contains more oxygen atoms relative \nto carbon or hydrogen atoms than do carbohydrates.\nB. Fat is calorically less dense than carbohydrates.C. Fat metabolism generates less carbon dioxide.D. The respiratory quotient (RQ) for fat is higher \nthan the RQ for carbohydrates.Correct answer = B. Kwashiorkor is caused by inade-\nquate protein intake in the presence of fair to good energy (calorie) intake. Typical findings in a patient with kwashi-orkor include abdominal and peripheral edema (note the swollen belly and legs) caused largely by a decreased serum albumin concentration. Body fat stores are depleted, but weight for height can be normal because of edema. Treatment includes a diet adequate in calories and protein.31.6. For the child shown at right, which of the state-\nments would support a diagnosis of kwashiorkor? The child:\nA. appears plump due to \nincreased deposition of fat in adipose tissue.\nB. displays abdominal and \nperipheral edema.\nC. has a serum albumin \nlevel above normal.\nD. has markedly decreased \nweight for height.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   520 24-10-2020   12:11:56"

OVERVIEW\nVitamins are chemically unrelated organic compounds that cannot be \nsynthesized in adequate quantities by humans and, therefore, must be supplied by the diet. Vitamins can broadly be classified as water soluble or fat soluble. Nine vitamins (folic acid, cobalamin, ascorbic acid, pyridoxine, thiamine, niacin, riboflavin, biotin, and pantothenic acid) are classified as water soluble. Because they are readily excreted in the urine, toxicity is rare. However, deficiencies can occur quickly. Four vitamins (A, D, K, and E) are termed fat soluble (\nFig. 32.1 ). They are released, absorbed, and trans-\nported (in chylomicrons, see p. 351) with dietary fat. They are not readily excreted, and significant quantities are stored in the liver and adipose tissue. In fact, consumption of vitamins A and D in excess of the Dietary Reference Intakes (see Chapter 31) can lead to accumulation of toxic quan-tities of these compounds. Vitamins are required to perform specific cellular functions. For example, many of the water-soluble vitamins are precursors of coenzymes for the enzymes of intermediary metabolism. In contrast to the water-soluble vitamins, only one fat-soluble vitamin (vitamin K) has a coenzyme function.\nII. FOLIC ACID (VITAMIN B 9)\nFolic acid (or, folate), which plays a key role in one-carbon metabolism, is essential for the biosynthesis of several compounds. Prevalence of folic acid deficiency varies from 10% to 60% in different Indian states because of dietary differences, particularly among pregnant women and individuals with alcoholism. Leafy, dark-green vegetables are a good source of folic acid.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the classification and enumerate the fat-soluble and water-\nsoluble vitamins and their major dietary sources and recommended daily allowances.\n\u2022 Describe the functions and biochemical role of vitamins A, D, E and K.\u2022 Discuss biochemical role of vitamins of the B-complex group and \nvitamin C.\n\u2022 Describe in brief the diseases associated with the deficiency of each \nof these vitamins.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   522 24-10-2020   12:11:56"

Folate deficiency\nInadequate serum levels of folate can be caused by:\n\u2022 Increased demand:  Seen in pregnancy and lactation (see p. 514).\n\u2022 Poor absorption: Caused by pathology of the small intestine, alco-\nholism, or treatment with drugs (for example, methotrexate) that are dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (see \nFig. 32.2 ). A folate-free diet \ncan cause a deficiency within a few weeks.\n Several folate antagonists, such as methotrexate, aminopterin and \namethopterin, are competitive inhibitors of enzyme DHFR, and are used as anti-cancer agents. As THF is not available for DNA synthesis, DNA synthesis activity of tumor cells is inhibited.\n Many microorganisms can synthesize folic acid from para-amino-\nbenzoic acid (PABA). PABA analogues, such as sulfonamides, can inhibit the synthesis of folic acid, therefore inhibiting bacterial growth. These are used as antibacterial agents.\n\u2022 Folate trap: The only reaction by which methyl-THF can be converted \nto THF is the methylation of homocysteine to methionine, a reac-tion which requires cobalamin (vitamin B\n12, see p. 525). Vitamin B 12 \ndeficiency may lead to accumulation of methyl-THF , decreasing the amount of available free THF . This condition, known as folate trap, can mimic folate deficiency.\nC. Folate deficiency diseases\n 1. Folate and anemia:  A primary result of folic acid deficiency is mega-\nloblastic anemia (see Fig. 32.4 ), caused by diminished synthesis \nof purine nucleotides and TMP , which leads to an inability of cells (including RBC precursors) to make DNA and, therefore, an inability to divide. As protein synthesis continues, hemoglobin accumulates in RBC precursors. The abnormal RBCs are rapidly destroyed in the spleen, causing anemia.Protein-energy malnutritionDeficiency in iron\nDeficiency in pyridoxineDeficiency in ascorbate\nDeficiency in vitamin B\n12\nDeficiency in folate\nNUTRITIONAL\nANEMIAS\nP t i l t itiNORMOCYTIC (MCV = 80\u2013100)\nMICROCYTIC (MCV <80)\nMACROCYTIC (MCV >100)\nFigure 32.3\nClassification of nutritional anemias \nby red cell size.

Folate and neural tube defects:  Spina bifida and anencephaly, \nthe most common neural tube defects (NTD), affect ~3,000 preg-nancies in the United States annually. Folic acid supplementation before conception and during the first trimester has been shown to significantly reduce NTD. Therefore, all women of childbearing age are advised to consume 0.4 mg/day (400 \u03bcg/day) of folic acid \nto reduce the risk of having a pregnancy affected by NTD and ten times that amount if a previous pregnancy was affected.\nAdequate folate nutrition must occur at the time of conception  \nbecause critical folate-dependent development occurs in the first weeks of fetal life, at a time when many women are not yet aware of their pregnancy. In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the addition of folic acid to wheat flour and enriched grain products, resulting in a dietary supplementation of ~0.1 mg/day. This supplementation allows ~50% of all reproductive-aged women to receive 0.4 mg of folate from all sources.\n 3. Folate and homocysteinemia:  As folate is required for conver-\nsion of homocysteine to methionine, its deficiency results in hyperhomocystienemia.\nD. Daily requirements\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for free folate is 500 \u03bcg/day. \nIt increases to 400 \u03bcg/day in pregnancy and 300 \u03bcg/day during lactation.\nIII. COBALAMIN (VITAMIN B 12)\nVitamin B 12 is required in humans for two essential enzymatic reactions: the \nremethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine and the isomerization of methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA), which is produced during the degra-dation of some amino acids (isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine) and fatty acids (FA) with odd numbers of carbon atoms (\nFig. 32.5 ). When \ncobalamin is deficient, unusual (branched) FA accumulate and become incorporated into cell membranes, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). This may account for some of the neurologic manifesta-tions of vitamin B\n12 deficiency. [Note: Folic acid (as N5-methyl THF) is also \nrequired in the remethylation of Hcy. Therefore, deficiency of B 12 or folate \nresults in elevated Hcy levels.]\nA. Structure and coenzyme forms\nCobalamin contains a corrin ring system that resembles the porphyrin ring of heme (see p. 416), but differs in that two of the pyrrole rings are linked directly rather than through a methenebridge. Cobalt (see p. 562) is held in the center of the corrin ring by four coordination bonds with the nitrogens of the pyrrole groups. The remaining coordination bonds of the cobalt are with the nitrogen of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole and with cyanide in commercial preparations of the vitamin in the form of cyanocobalamin (\nFig. 32.6 ). The physiologic coenzyme forms of cobal-\namin are 5 \u2032-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, in which \ncyanide is replaced with 5 \u2032-deoxyadenosine or a methyl group, respec-\ntively (see Fig. 32.6 ).MethionineTetrahydrofolateN5-Methyl-\ntetrahydrofolateHomocysteine\nSuccinyl CoAMethylmalonyl CoA\nCH2CCOO\u2013\nCoACH2\nOCH3CCOO\u2013\nCoA\nOC H\nVitamin B12\n(deoxyadenosyl-\ncobalamin)Methylmalonyl CoA\nmutaseVitamin B12\n(methyl-\ncobalamin)\nOdd-numbered fatty acids\nSome amino acidsMethionine \nsynthaseA\nB\nFigure 32.5\nA, B.

Such tissues need both the N\n5,N10-\nmethylene and N10-formyl forms of THF for the synthesis of nucleo-\ntides required for DNA replication (see pp. 574 and 585). However, in vitamin B\n12 deficiency, the utilization of the N5-methyl form of THF in the \nB12-dependent methylation of Hcy to methionine is impaired. Because \nthe methylated form cannot be converted directly to other forms of THF , folate is trapped in the N\n5-methyl form, which accumulates. The levels \nof the other forms decrease. Thus, cobalamin deficiency leads to a defi-ciency of the THF forms needed in purine and TMP synthesis, resulting in the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia.\nE. Clinical indications for cobalamin\nIn contrast to other water-soluble vitamins, significant amounts (2\u20135 mg) of vitamin B\n12 are stored in the body.

[Note: Deficiency happens much more quickly (in months) if absorption is impaired (see below).\n 1. Pernicious anemia:  Vitamin B\n12 deficiency is most commonly seen \nin patients who fail to absorb the vitamin from the intestine ( Fig. 32.7 ). \nVitamin B 12 is released from food in the acidic environment of the \nstomach. [Note: Malabsorption of cobalamin in the elderly is most often due to reduced secretion of gastric acid (achlorhydria).] Free B\n12 then binds a glycoprotein (R-protein or haptocorrin), and the \ncomplex moves into the intestine. B 12 is released from the R-protein \nby pancreatic enzymes and binds another glycoprotein, intrinsic factor (IF). The cobalamin\u2013IF complex travels through the intestine and binds to a receptor (cubilin) on the surface of mucosal cells in the ileum. The cobalamin is transported into the mucosal cell and, subsequently, into the general circulation, where it is carried by its binding protein (transcobalamin). B\n12 is taken up and stored \nin the liver, primarily. It is released into bile and efficiently reab-sorbed in the ileum. Severe malabsorption of vitamin B\n12 leads to \npernicious anemia.\nThis disease is most commonly caused due to an autoimmune \ndestruction of the gastric parietal cells that are responsible for the synthesis of IF (lack of IF prevents B\n12 absorption).\nPatients who have had a partial or total gastrectomy become IF \ndeficient and, therefore, B 12 deficient.\nIndividuals with cobalamin deficiency are usually anemic (folate \nrecycling is impaired), and they show neuropsychiatric symptoms as the disease develops. The CNS effects are irreversible . Pernicious \nanemia requires lifelong treatment with either high-dose oral B\n12 or \nintramuscular injection of cyanocobalamin. [Note: Supplementation works even in the absence of IF because ~1% of B\n12 uptake is by \nIF-independent diffusion.]\nF. Assessment\nThe Schilling test  evaluates vitamin B 12 absorption. Vitamin B 12 \ndeficiency can be determined by the level of methylmalonic acid in blood, which is elevated in individuals with low intake or decreased absorption of the vitamin.\nELISA : Plasma levels of vitamin B\n12 can be quantified by ELISA.\nMethylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria : As cobalamin defi-\nciency leads to accumulation of methylmalonic acid (methylmalonic aciduria)and homocysteine (homocystinuria), these can be measured.\nG.

Biochemical functions of vitamin C\n\u2022 Vitamin C is a coenzyme in hydroxylation reactions (for example, \nhydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues in collagen; see p. 125), where its role is to keep the iron (Fe) of hydroxylases  in the reduced, \nferrous (Fe\n+2) form. Thus, vitamin C is required for the maintenance \nof normal connective tissue as well as for wound healing.\n\u2022 Vitamin C also facilitates the absorption of dietary nonheme iron from \nthe intestine by reduction of the ferric form (Fe+3) to Fe+2 (see p. 557).\n\u2022 Ascorbate is required in tyrosine catabolism as a coenzyme for \n4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.\n\u2022 It is also required for hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryp-\ntophan, in synthesis of serotonin.\n\u2022 7-alpha-hydroxylase requires ascorbic acid for synthesis of bile \nacids.\n\u2022 It is also required for synthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine by \nthe enzyme dopamine beta-monooxygenase .\n\u2022 Carnitine synthesis requires ascorbate-dependent dioxygenases.\u2022 Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant. The role of Vitamin C in prevention \nof cancer, cardiovascular diseases and cataract is under research.\nB. Deficiency\nAscorbic acid deficiency results in scurvy, a disease characterized by sore and spongy gums, loose teeth, fragile blood vessels, hemorrhage, swollen joints, bone changes, and fatigue (\nFig. 32.9 ). Many of the defi-\nciency symptoms can be explained by the decreased hydroxylation of collagen, resulting in defective connective tissue. A microcytic anemia caused by decreased absorption of iron may also be seen.\nC. Chronic disease prevention\nVitamin C is one of a group of nutrients that includes vitamin E (see p. 544) and \u03b2-carotene (see p. 534), which are known as antioxidants. \n[Note: Vitamin C regenerates the functional, reduced form of vitamin E.] Consumption of diets rich in these compounds is associated with a decreased incidence of some chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and certain cancers. However, clinical trials involving supplementation with the isolated antioxidants have failed to demon-strate any convincing preventive effects.\nD. Dietary sources of vitamin C\nVitamin C is abundant in citrus fruits, such as lime, lemon, amla  (Indian \ngooseberry) and broccoli, strawberries and tomatoes.\nE. Daily requirements\nAn adult requires about 40 mg/day of vitamin C.\nFigure 32.9\nOral manifestations in a patient with \nscurvy.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   528 24-10-2020   12:12:00"

They differ only in the nature of the func-tional group attached to the ring (\nFig. 32.10 ). Pyridoxine occurs primarily \nin plants, whereas pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are found in foods obtained from animals. Yeast, wheat germs, cereals, eggs, milk, tuna, and salmon are rich sources of vitamin B\n6. All three compounds can serve as precur-\nsors of the biologically active coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). PLP functions as a coenzyme for a large number of enzymes, particularly those that catalyze reactions involving amino acids, for example, in the trans-sulfuration of Hcy to cysteine (see p. 400). [Note: PLP is also required by glycogen phosphorylase  (see p. 229).]\nReaction type Example\nTransamination Oxaloacetate + glutamate \n aspartate + \u03b1-ketoglutarate\nDeamination Serine \u2192 pyruvate + NH 3\nDecarboxylation Histidine \u2192 histamine + CO 2\nCondensation Glycine + succinyl CoA \u2192 \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid\nTranssulfuration Homocysteine + Serine \u2192 Cystathionine\nCystathionine \u2192 Homoserine + Cysteine\nPyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor for the enzyme kynuren-\ninase , in catabolism of tryptophan. In deficiency of PLP , \nalternate metabolite, xanthurenic acid is excreted in urine. Increased urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid is an indicator of pyridoxine deficiency.\nA. Clinical indications for pyridoxine\nIsoniazid, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can induce a \nvitamin B 6 deficiency by forming an inactive derivative with PLP . Thus, \ndietary supplementation with B 6 is an adjunct to isoniazid treatment. \nCycloserine, another antitubercular drug, also acts as B 6 antagonist.\nOtherwise, dietary deficiencies in pyridoxine are rare but have been \nobserved in newborn infants fed formulas low in B 6, in women taking \noral contraceptives, and in those with alcoholism.\nThe major manifestations of B 6 deficiency include neurological dysfunc-\ntion and anemia. Due to B 6 deficiency, synthesis of serotonin, epineph-\nrine and GABA is impaired. Decreased synthesis of sphingolipids can cause demyelination of nerves and peripheral neuritis. Decreased GABA formation can produce convulsions. Anemia is caused due to impaired heme synthesis.\nB. Toxicity\nVitamin B 6 is the only water-soluble vitamin with significant toxicity. \nNeurologic symptoms (sensory neuropathy) occur at intakes above 500 mg/day, an amount nearly 400 times the RDA and over 5 times the tolerable upper limit (UL). (See Chapter 31 for a discussion of RDA and UL.) Substantial improvement, but not complete recovery, occurs when the vitamin is discontinued.N. .OH\nCH3\nPyridoxineCH2OH\nN. .OH\nCH3\nPyridoxamineCH2NH2=O3PO\u2013CH2\u2013\nHO\u2013CH2\u2013N+OH\nCH3\nPyridoxal \nphosphateHCH O\nHO\u2013CH2\u2013\nHO\u2013CH2\u2013N+OH\nCH3\nPyridoxalHCH O\nNIsoniazidCONHNH2\nFigure 32.10\nStructures of vitamin B 6 and the \nantituberculosis drug isoniazid.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   529 24-10-2020   12:12:01"

THIAMINE (VITAMIN B 1)\nThiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is the biologically active form of the vitamin, \nformed by the transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to thiamine (\nFig. 32.11 ). TPP serves as a coenzyme in the formation or degradation of \n\u03b1-ketols by transketolase  (Fig. 32.12A ) and in the oxidative decarboxylation \nof \u03b1-keto acids ( Fig. 32.12B ).\nA.

Clinical indications for thiamine\nThe oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which \nplays a key role in energy metabolism of most cells, is particularly important in tissues of the CNS. In thiamine deficiency, the activity of these two dehydrogenase -catalyzed reactions is decreased, resulting in \ndecreased production of ATP and, therefore, impaired cellular function. TPP is also required by branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase  of \nmuscle (see p. 401). [Note: It is the decarboxylase  of each of these \n\u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase  multienzyme complexes that requires TPP .]\n 1. Beriberi:  This severe thiamine-deficiency syndrome is found in \nareas where polished rice is the major component of the diet. Adult beriberi is classified as dry (characterized by peripheral neuropathy with sensory disturbances, especially in the legs) or wet (character-ized by edema because of dilated cardiomyopathy, palpitations and breathlessness). Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants, born to mothers having thiamine deficiency.\n 2. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome:  In the United States, thiamine \ndeficiency, which is seen primarily in association with chronic alco-holism, is due to dietary insufficiency or impaired intestinal absorp-tion of the vitamin. Some individuals with alcoholism develop Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a thiamine-deficiency state char-acterized by mental confusion, gait ataxia, nystagmus (a to-and-fro motion of the eyeballs), and ophthalmoplegia (weakness of eye muscles) with Wernicke encephalopathy as well as memory prob-lems and hallucinations with Korsakoff dementia. The syndrome is treatable with thiamine supplementation, but recovery of memory is typically incomplete.\nC.

Niacin (Vitamin B 3) 531\nVitamin deficiencies in chronic alcoholics\nBoth acute and chronic alcohol consumption can cause \nmalnutrition by multiple mechanisms, which include decreasing dietary caloric intake, impairing nutrient digestion and absorption, and increasing breakdown and excretion of nutrients.\nBoth fat- and water-soluble vitamin deficiencies occur with \nmoderate to severe alcohol use disorder. Vitamin A and K deficiencies are rare in the absence of liver disease or chronic pancreatitis.\nThiamine deficiency is found in up to 80%, pyridoxine defi-\nciency in over 50% and folate deficiency in about one-third of alcoholic patients.\nVII. NIACIN (VITAMIN B 3)\nNiacin, or nicotinic acid, is a substituted pyridine derivative. The biologically \nactive coenzyme forms are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and \nits phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP\n+), as shown in Figure 32.13 . Nicotinamide, a derivative of nicotinic \nacid that contains an amide instead of a carboxyl group, also occurs in the diet. Nicotinamide is readily deaminated in the body and, therefore, is nutri-tionally equivalent to nicotinic acid. NAD\n+ and NADP+ serve as coenzymes \nin oxidation\u2013reduction reactions in which the coenzyme undergoes reduc-tion of the pyridine ring by accepting two electrons from a hydride ion, as shown in \nFigure 32.14 . The reduced forms of NAD+ and NADP+ are NADH \nand NADPH, respectively. NAD+ is used in the catabolic redox reactions, \nwhile NADPH is used in reductive biosynthesis. NAD+ is also a donor of \nADP-ribose in ADP-ribosylation reactions required for DNA repair and post-translational modifications in eukaryotes.\nA metabolite of tryptophan, quinolinate, can be converted to NAD(P).

Clinical indications for niacin\n 1. Deficiency:  A deficiency of niacin causes pellagra, a disease \ninvolving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and CNS. The symptoms of pellagra progress through the three Ds: dermatitis (photosensi-tive), diarrhea, and dementia. If untreated, death (a fourth D) occurs. Hartnup disorder, characterized by defective absorption of trypto-phan, can result in pellagra-like symptoms..]\n 2. Hyperlipidemia treatment:  Niacin at doses of 1.5 g/day, or 100 times \nthe RDA, strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, the primary producer of circulating free fatty acids (FFA). The liver normally uses these circulating FFA as a major precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Thus, niacin causes a decrease in liver TAG synthesis, which is required for very-low-density lipoprotein ([VLDL], see p. 353) production. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the cholesterol-rich lipo-protein) is derived from VLDL in the plasma. Thus, both plasma TAG (in VLDL) and cholesterol (in LDL) are lowered. Therefore, niacin is particularly useful in the treatment of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both VLDL and LDL are elevated. Niacin raises high-density lipoprotein and lowers Lp(a) levels (see p. 360).\nHowever, the high doses of niacin required can cause acute, pros-\ntaglandin-mediated flushing. Aspirin can reduce this side effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis (see p. 333). Itching may also occur.\nC. Daily requirements\nThe RDA for niacin is 16\u201321 mg/day.\nVIII. RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B 2)\nRiboflavin consists of an isoalloxazine ring with a ribitol (alcohol of ribose sugar) side chain. The two biologically active forms of B\n2 are flavin mononu-\ncleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), formed by the transfer of an adenosine monophosphate moiety from ATP to FMN (\nFig. 32.15 ). \nFMN and FAD are each capable of reversibly accepting two hydrogen atoms, forming FMNH\n2 or FADH 2, respectively. FMN and FAD are bound \ntightly, sometimes covalently, to flavoenzymes (for example, NADH dehy-\ndrogenase  [FMN] and succinate dehydrogenase  [FAD]) that catalyze the \noxidation or reduction of a substrate.\nRiboflavin deficiency is uncommon as it is synthesized by the intestinal \nbacteria. Riboflavin deficiency is not associated with a major human disease, although it frequently accompanies other vitamin deficiencies. Deficiency symptoms include dermatitis, cheilosis (fissuring at the corners of the mouth), and glossitis (the tongue appearing smooth and dark).\nRiboflavin is heat stable but sensitive to light. Due to light sensitivity, \nphototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia (see p. 422) may require supplementa-tion with the vitamin.NADHH\nCONH2\nN:H-\nH\nRibose RiboseAdenineNAD+CONH2H\nRibose RiboseAdenine+\nN\nHydride \nion\nPPPP\nFigure 32.14\nReduction of oxidized nicotinamide \nadenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH. \n[Note: The hydride ion consists of a hydrogen (H) atom plus an electron.] = phosphate.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   532 24-10-2020   12:12:02"

BIOTIN (VITAMIN B 7)\nBiotin is a coenzyme in carboxylation reactions, in which it serves as a carrier of activated carbon dioxide (CO\n2) (see Fig. 15.3, p. 218, for the \nmechanism of biotin-dependent carboxylations). Biotin is covalently bound to the \u03b5-amino group of lysine residues in biotin-dependent enzymes \n(\nFig. 32.16 ). Biotin deficiency does not occur naturally because the vitamin \nis widely distributed in food. Also, a large percentage of the biotin require-ment in humans is supplied by intestinal bacteria. However, the addition of raw egg white to the diet as a source of protein can cause biotin defi-ciency. Raw egg white contains the glycoprotein avidin, which tightly binds biotin and prevents its absorption from the intestine. Symptoms of biotin deficiency include dermatitis, hair loss, loss of appetite, and nausea. With a normal diet, however, it has been estimated that 20 eggs/day would be required to induce a deficiency syndrome. [Note: Inclusion of raw eggs in the diet is not recommended because of the possibility of salmonellosis caused by infection with Salmonella enterica.]\nMultiple carboxylase deficiency results from decreased \nability to add biotin to carboxylases  during their synthesis \nor to remove it during their degradation.

CoA contains a thiol group that carries acyl \ncompounds as activated thiol esters. Examples of such structures are succinyl CoA, fatty acyl CoA, and acetyl CoA. Pantothenic acid is also a component of the acyl carrier protein domain of fatty acid synthase  \n(see p. 301).\nEggs, liver, and yeast are the most important sources of pantothenic acid, \nalthough the vitamin is widely distributed. Pantothenic acid deficiency is not well characterized in humans, and no RDA has been established.\nAs pantothenic acid is widely available, deficiency is uncommon but can \nbe seen in chronic alcoholics, renal dialysis patients and during famines. It can cause Burning Feet Syndrome, characterized by burning pain in lower limbs, gait disturbances and sleep disturbances.\nA. Daily requirements\nRDA of pantothenic acid is 5 mg/day.\nXI. VITAMIN A\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that comes primarily from animal sources as retinol (preformed vitamin A), a retinoid. The retinoids, a family of struc-turally related molecules, are essential for vision, reproduction, growth, and maintenance of epithelial tissues. They also play a role in immune func-tion. Retinoic acid, derived from oxidation of retinol, mediates most of the actions of the retinoids, except for vision, which depends on retinal, the aldehyde derivative of retinol.\nA. Structure\nThe retinoids include the natural forms of vitamin A, retinol and its metabolites (\nFig. 32.18 ), and synthetic forms (drugs). Retinoids are \nfound only in animals. Chemically, they are polyisoprenoid compounds having a cyclohexenyl ring with a side chain made up of several isoprene units. The side chain has alternate double bonds, producing trans and cis isomers.\n 1. Retinol:  A primary alcohol containing a \u03b2-ionone ring with an unsat-\nurated side chain, retinol is found in animal tissues as a retinyl ester with long-chain FA. It is the storage form of vitamin A.\n 2. Retinal:  This is the aldehyde derived from the oxidation of retinol. \nRetinal and retinol can readily be interconverted.\n 3. Retinoic acid:  This is the acid derived from the oxidation of retinal. \nRetinoic acid cannot be reduced in the body and, therefore, cannot give rise to either retinal or retinol.\n 4. \ud835\udec3-Carotene:  Plant foods contain \u03b2-carotene (provitamin A), which \ncan be oxidatively and symmetrically cleaved in the intestine to yield two molecules of retinal. In humans, the conversion is inefficient, and the vitamin A activity of \u03b2-carotene is only about 1/12 that of retinol.O\nPantothenic acidCN CC H2OH\nOH CH3CH3\nCHH\nCH2 CH2 CO\n\u2013O\nOCN CC H2O\nOH CH3CH3\nCHH\nCH2 CH2 CO\nNH\nCH2\nCH2\nSHP\nOO O\u2013\nP O O\u2013NH2\nOO\nOH\nO\u2013O P\n\u2013OONN\nN N\nFigure 32.17\nStructure of coenzyme A.\nO C\n11-cis Retinal\n(formed by photoisomerization\nof all-trans retinal)O CRetinol\nRetinal\nRetinoic acid\n(all trans)OH CH2\nO\nHC\nHO\nH\nFigure 32.18\nStructure of the retinoids.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   534 24-10-2020   12:12:04"

            "Text": "XI. Vitamin A 535\nB. Absorption and transport to the liver\nRetinyl esters from the diet are hydrolyzed in the intestinal mucosa, \nreleasing retinol and FFA ( Fig. 32.19 ). Retinol derived from esters and \nfrom the reduction of retinal from \u03b2-carotene cleavage is reesterified \nto long-chain FA within the enterocytes and secreted as a component of chylomicrons into the lymphatic system. Retinyl esters contained in chylomicron remnants are taken up by, and stored in, the liver. Liver stores 90% of body\u2019s vitamin A. [Note: All fat-soluble vitamins are carried in chylomicrons.]\nC. Release from the liver\nWhen needed, retinol is released from the liver and transported through the blood to extrahepatic tissues by retinol-binding protein (RBP) complexed with transthyretin (T4 binding prealbumin). As RBP is a small molecular weight protein, it can be filtered by kidneys. To prevent this loss, RBP is reversibly complexed with transthyretin (see \nFig. 32.19 ). The ternary complex binds to a transport protein on the \nsurface of the cells of peripheral tissues, permitting retinol to enter. An intracellular retinol-binding protein carries retinol to sites in the nucleus where the vitamin regulates transcription in a manner analogous to that of steroid hormones.\nD. Retinoic acid mechanism of action\nRetinol is oxidized to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid binds with high affinity to specific receptor proteins (retinoic acid receptors [RAR]) present in the nucleus of target tissues such as epithelial cells (\nFig. 32.20 ). The \nactivated retinoic acid\u2013RAR complex binds to response elements on DNA and recruits activators or repressors to regulate retinoid-specific RNA synthesis, resulting in control of the production of specific proteins that mediate several physiologic functions. For example, retinoids control the expression of the gene for keratin in most epithelial tissues of the body. [Note: The RAR proteins are part of the superfamily of tran-scriptional regulators that includes the nuclear receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones and vitamin D, all of which function in a similar way (see p. 363).]\nE. Functions\n 1. Visual cycle:  Vitamin A is a component of the visual pigments of \nrod and cone cells. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, consists of 11-cis retinal bound to the protein opsin (see \nFig. 32.19 ). When rhodopsin, a G protein\u2013coupled receptor, is \nexposed to light, a series of photochemical isomerizations occurs, which results in the bleaching of rhodopsin and release of all-trans retinal and opsin. This process activates the G protein transducin, triggering a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. Regeneration of rhodopsin requires isomerization of all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal. All-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol, esterified, and isomerized to 11-cis retinol that is oxidized to 11-cis retinal. The latter combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, thus completing the cycle. This whole cycle of changes in rhodopsin on exposure to light and its regeneration is known as Wald\u2019s visual cycle. Similar reactions, performed by conopsin (similar to rhodopsin), are responsible for color vision in the cone cells. There are three types of conopsin: cyanopsin (for blue color), iodopsin (for green color) and porphyropsin (for red color). Dark adaptation\nWhen a person shifts from \nbright light to dark, there is difficulty in seeing but the vision improves after a few minutes. This delay is due to time taken for regeneration of rhodopsin after its stores are depleted by bright light. This time is known as dark adap-tation time. It increases in vitamin A deficiency.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   535 24-10-2020   12:12:04"

If untreated, xerophthalmia results in corneal ulceration and, ultimately, in blindness because of the formation of opaque scar tissue. The condition is most commonly seen in children in developing tropical countries. Over 500,000 children worldwide are blinded each year by xerophthalmia caused by insufficient vitamin A in the diet.\n\u2022 Gonadal dysfunctions: Testicular degeneration in males and an \nincreased incidence of miscarriage.\nFigure 32.20\nAction of the retinoids.

VITAMIN D\nThe D vitamins are a group of sterols that have a hormone-like func-tion. The active molecule, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ([1,25-diOH-D\n3], \nor calcitriol), binds to intracellular receptor proteins. The 1,25-diOH-D 3\u2013\nreceptor complex interacts with response elements in the nuclear DNA of target cells in a manner similar to that of vitamin A (see \nFig. 32.20 ) and \neither selectively stimulates or represses gene transcription. The most prominent actions of calcitriol are to regulate the serum levels of calcium and phosphorus.\nA. Distribution\n 1. Endogenous vitamin precursor:  7-Dehydrocholesterol, an inter-\nmediate in cholesterol synthesis, is converted to cholecalciferol in the dermis and epidermis of humans exposed to ultraviolet light (290\u2013315 nm) from sunlight and transported to liver bound to vitamin D\u2013binding protein. Vitamin D is also known as \u201csunshine\u201d vitamin.\n 2. Diet:  Ergocalciferol (vitamin D\n2), found in plants, and cholecalcif-\nerol (vitamin D 3), found in animal tissues, are sources of preformed \nvitamin D activity ( Fig. 32.22 ). Vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 differ chem-\nically only in the presence of an additional double-bond and methyl group in the plant sterol. Dietary vitamin D is packaged into chylo-microns. [Note: Preformed vitamin D is a dietary requirement only in individuals with limited exposure to sunlight.]\nB. Metabolism\n 1. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol formation:  Vitamins D 2 and D 3 \nare not biologically active but are converted in vivo to calcitriol, the active form of the D vitamin, by two sequential hydroxylation reactions (\nFig. 32.23 ). The first hydroxylation occurs at the 25 posi-\ntion and is catalyzed by a specific 25-hydroxylase  in the liver.

In the kidney, 25-OH-D 3 is further hydrox-\nylated at the 1 position by 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 1-hydroxylase , \nresulting in the formation of 1,25-diOH-D 3 (calcitriol). [Note: Both \nhydroxylases  are cytochrome P450 proteins (see p. 254).]\n 2. Hydroxylation regulation:  Calcitriol is the most potent vitamin D \nmetabolite. Its formation is tightly regulated by the level of serum phosphate (PO\n43\u2212) and calcium ions (Ca2+) as shown in Figure 32.24 . \n25-Hydroxycholecalciferol 1-hydroxylase  activity is increased directly \nby low serum PO 43\u2212. Low serum Ca2+ triggers the secretion of para-\nthyroid hormone (PTH) from the chief cells of the parathyroid gland, which upregulates the 1-hydroxylase . Thus, hypocalcemia caused \nby insufficient dietary Ca\n2+ results in elevated levels of serum 1,25-\ndiOH-D 3. [Note: 1,25-diOH-D 3 inhibits expression of PTH, forming a \nnegative feedback loop. It also inhibits activity of the 1-hydroxylase .]\nC. Function\nThe overall function of calcitriol is to maintain adequate serum levels of \nCa2+. It performs this function by 1) increasing uptake of Ca2+ by the \nintestine, 2) minimizing loss of Ca2+ by the kidney by increasing reab-\nsorption, and 3) stimulating resorption (demineralization) of bone when blood Ca\n2+ is low (see Fig. 32.23 ).\n 1. Effect on the intestine:  Calbindin is a calcium-binding protein, \nwhich is required for absorption of calcium from the intestinal cell to blood. Calcitriol stimulates intestinal absorption of Ca\n2+ by first \nentering the intestinal cell and binding to a cytosolic receptor. The 1,25-diOH-D\n3\u2013receptor complex then moves to the nucleus where \nit selectively interacts with response elements on the DNA. As a result, Ca\n2+ uptake is enhanced by increased expression of calbi-\nndin. Thus, the mechanism of action of 1,25-diOH-D 3 is typical of \nsteroid hormones (see p. 363).\n 2. Effect on bone:  Bone is composed of collagen and crystals of \nCa5(PO 4)3OH (hydroxyapatite). When blood Ca2+ is low, 1,25-\ndiOH-D 3 stimulates bone resorption by a process that is enhanced \nby PTH. The result is an increase in serum Ca2+. Therefore, bone \nis an important reservoir of Ca2+ that can be mobilized to maintain \nserum levels. [Note: PTH and calcitriol also work together to prevent renal loss of Ca\n2+.]\nVitamin D also increases the mineralization of bone. This effect is \nmediated by multiple mechanisms, including increased production of calbindin-9 and increased local concentration of phosphate in bone which promotes bone mineralization.\n 3. Effect on kidneys:  Calcitriol increases the reabsorption of both \ncalcium and phosphorus by renal tubules.\nD. Distribution and daily requirements\nVitamin D occurs naturally in fatty fish, liver, and egg yolk. Milk, unless it is artificially fortified, is not a good source. The RDA for individuals ages 1\u201370 years is 10 \u03bcg/day.

Clinical indications for vitamin D\n 1. Nutritional rickets:  Vitamin D deficiency causes a net demineral-\nization of bone, resulting in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults (\nFig. 32.25 ). Rickets is characterized by the continued forma-\ntion of the collagen matrix of bone, but incomplete mineraliza-tion results in soft, pliable bones. Weight-bearing bones are bent. Features of rickets include bowed legs, knock-knee, Harrison\u2019s sulcus (transverse depression extending from costal cartilage to axilla), rickety rosary (beading of ribs at costochondral junctions), bossing of frontal bones, and pigeon chest. In osteomalacia, demineralization of preexisting bones increases their susceptibility to fracture. Insufficient exposure to daylight and/or deficiencies in vitamin D consumption occur predominantly in infants and the elderly. In both rickets and osteomalacia, plasma calcium and phos-phorus levels are low and  alkaline phosphatase level (bone fraction) \nis markedly elevated. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the northern latitudes, because less vitamin D synthesis occurs in the skin as a result of reduced exposure to ultraviolet light. [Note: Loss-of-function mutations in the vitamin D receptor result in hereditary vitamin D\u2013deficient rickets.]\n 2. Renal osteodystrophy:  Chronic kidney disease causes decreased \nability to form active vitamin D as well as increased retention of PO\n43\u2212, resulting in hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. The low \nblood Ca2+ causes a rise in PTH and associated bone demineraliza-\ntion with release of Ca2+ and PO 43\u2212. Supplementation with vitamin D \nis an effective therapy. However, supplementation must be accom-panied by PO\n43\u2212 reduction therapy to prevent further bone loss and \nprecipitation of calcium phosphate crystals.\n 3. Hypoparathyroidism:  Parathyroid hormone increases blood \ncalcium level (by increased resorption of bone) and decreases blood phosphate level (by increasing its renal excretion). Lack of PTH causes hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Patients may be treated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation.\nG. Toxicity\nLike all fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin D can be stored in the body and is only slowly metabolized. High doses (100,000 IU for weeks or months) can cause toxicity, manifested by loss of appetite, nausea, thirst, and weakness. Enhanced Ca\n2+ absorption and bone resorption results in \nhypercalcemia, which can lead to deposition of calcium salts in soft tissue (metastatic calcification). The UL is 100 \u03bcg/day (4,000 IU/day) for \nindividuals ages 9 years or older, with a lower level for those under age Figure 32.25\nBowed legs of middle-aged man \nwith osteomalacia, a nutritional vitamin D deficiency that results in demineralization of the skeleton.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   542 24-10-2020   12:12:09"

VITAMIN K\nThe principal role of vitamin K is in the posttranslational modification of a number of proteins (most of which are involved with blood clotting), in which it serves as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues in these proteins. Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin with coenzyme function. Vitamin K exists in several active forms, for example, in plants as phylloquinone (or vitamin K\n1), and in intestinal bacteria as mena-\nquinone (or vitamin K 2). A synthetic form of vitamin K, menadione, is able \nto be converted to K 2.\nA. Function\n 1. \u03b3-Carboxyglutamate formation:  Vitamin K is required in the hepatic \nsynthesis of the blood clotting proteins, prothrombin (factor [F]II) and FVII, FIX, and FX. Formation of the functional clotting factors requires the vitamin K\u2013dependent carboxylation of several glutamic acid residues to \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues (\nFig. 32.26 ). The \ncarboxylation reaction requires \u03b3-glutamyl carboxylase , O 2, CO 2, \nand the hydroquinone form of vitamin K (which gets oxidized to the epoxide form). The formation of Gla residues is sensitive to inhibition by warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K that inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase  (VKOR ), the enzyme required to regen-\nerate the functional hydroquinone form of vitamin K.\n 2. Prothrombin interaction with membranes\nThe Gla residues are good chelators of positively charged calcium \nions, because of their two adjacent, negatively charged carboxylate groups. With prothrombin, for example, the prothrombin\u2013calcium complex is able to bind to negatively charged membrane phos-pholipids on the surface of damaged endothelium and platelets. Attachment to membrane increases the rate at which the proteo-lytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin can occur (\nFig. 32.27 ).C\nOCH NH\nCH2\nCH2\nOCO\u2013Precursors of \nclotting factorsII, VII, IX, XPolypeptide\nC\nOCH NH\nCH2\nCHO2 CO2\nOCO\u2013OCO\u2013  -Carboxy-\nglutamyl(Gla) residuegMature clotting\nfactorsII, VII, IX, XVitamin Kh\nWarfarin Vitamin KeGlutamyl residue\ng-Glutamyl \ncarboxylase VKOR\nFigure 32.26\nCarboxylation of glutamate to form \n\u03b3-carboxyglutamate. h = hydroquinone; \ne = epoxide; VKOR  = vitamin K epoxide \nreductase .\nLIVERPrecursors of\nII, VII, IX, X\u03b3-Carboxyglutamate\nII, VII, IX, X\nBLOODCOO\u2013COO\u2013COO\u2013COO\u2013 \u2013OOC\u2013OOC\nH3N+H3N+CO2\nCOO\u2013COO\u2013H3N+\nCOO\u2013\nMature\nII, VII, IX, XCOO\u2013 \u2013OOC\u2013OOCMembrane phospholipids\nCOO\u2013Ca2+ Calcium\nbridgeCa2+\nVitamin K\nFigure 32.27\nRole of vitamin K in blood coagulation.

Micronutrients: Vitamins\n 3. \u03b3-Carboxyglutamate residues in other proteins:  Gla residues are \nalso present in proteins other than those involved in forming a blood clot. For example, osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein of bone and proteins C and S (involved in limiting the formation of blood clots) also undergo \u03b3-carboxylation. Osteocalcin is a protein synthesized \nby osteoblasts which binds to hydroxyapatite crystals and retains calcium.\nB. Distribution and daily requirements\nVitamin K is found in cabbage, kale, spinach, egg yolk, and liver. The adequate intake for vitamin K is 55 \u03bcg/day. There is also synthesis of \nthe vitamin by the gut microbiota.\nC. Clinical indications for vitamin K\n 1. Deficiency:  A true vitamin K deficiency is unusual because adequate \namounts are generally obtained from the diet and produced by intes-tinal bacteria. Increased bleeding tendency confirmed by increased prothrombin time (PT) is an important manifestation of vitamin K deficiency. Deficiency may be caused due to:\na.  Treatment with antibiotics:  If the bacterial population in the \ngut is decreased, the amount of endogenously formed vitamin is decreased, and this can lead to hypoprothrombinemia in the marginally malnourished individual (for example, a debilitated geriatric patient). This condition may require supplementation with vitamin K to correct the bleeding tendency.\nb. Fat malabsorption syndromesc.  Vitamin K antagonists:  Agents, such as dicoumarinand warfarin \nare competitive inhibitors of vitamin K. In addition, certain ceph-alosporin antibiotics (for example, cefamandole) cause hypo-prothrombinemia, apparently by a warfarin-like mechanism that inhibits VKOR . Consequently, their use in treatment is \nusually supplemented with vitamin K. Deficiency can also affect bone health.\n 2. Deficiency in the newborn:  Because newborns have sterile \nintestines, they initially lack the bacteria that synthesize vitamin K. Because human milk provides only about one fifth of the daily require-ment for vitamin K, it is recommended that all newborns receive a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K as prophylaxis against hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.\nD. Toxicity\nProlonged administration of large doses of menadione can produce hemolyticanemia and jaundice in the infant, because of toxic effects on the RBC membrane. Therefore, it is no longer used to treat vitamin K deficiency. No UL for the natural form has been set.\nXIV. VITAMIN E\nThe E vitamins consist of eight naturally occurring tocopherols, of which \u03b1-tocopherol is the most active (\nFig. 32.28 ). Vitamin E functions as an anti-\noxidant in prevention of nonenzymic oxidations (for example, oxidation of 3H3C OCH3\nHO\nCH3HH3C\nCH3 H\nFigure 32.28\nStructure of vitamin E ( \u03b1-tocopherol).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   544 24-10-2020   12:12:10"

Vitamin E is a prominent membrane antioxidant, where it prevents membrane lipids from oxidation by endogenous as well as exogenous free radicals. [Note: Vitamin C regenerates active vitamin E.]\nDue to its antioxidant activity, vitamin E is also considered to be anti-\natherogenic, preventing the oxidation of LDL.\n \nA. Distribution and daily requirements\nVegetable oils are rich sources of vitamin E, whereas liver and eggs contain moderate amounts. The RDA for \u03b1-tocopherol is 7.5\u201310 mg/day \nfor adults. The vitamin E requirement increases as the intake of polyun-saturated FA increases to limit FA peroxidation.\nB. Deficiency\nNewborns have low reserves of vitamin E, but breast milk (and formulas) contain the vitamin. Very-low-birth-weight infants may be given supplements to prevent the hemolysis and retinopathy associ-ated with vitamin E deficiency. When observed in adults, deficiency is usually associated with defective lipid absorption or transport. [Note: Abetalipoproteinemia, caused by a defect in the formation of chylomi-crons (and VLDL), results in vitamin E deficiency (see p. 354).]\nC. Clinical indications for vitamin E\nVitamin E is not recommended for the prevention of chronic disease, such as CVD or cancer. Clinical trials using vitamin E supplementation have been uniformly disappointing. [Note: Vitamins E and C are used to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration.]\nD. Toxicity\nVitamin E is the least toxic of the fat-soluble vitamins, and no toxicity has been observed at doses of 300 mg/day (UL = 1,000 mg/day).\nXV. Medical Perspectives\nOne in three preschool-aged children and one in six pregnant women are deficient in vitamin A due to inadequate dietary \nintake. The WHO has classified vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem affecting about 44% children in South Asia. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness and increases the risk of death from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea. Besides preventing blindness, vitamin A supplementation can reduce mortality in children. The WHO recommends that in vitamin A-deficient areas, children 6 months to 5 years should receive a preventive dose of vitamin A supplementation every 6 months. In India, children below 1 year receive the first vitamin A supplementation dose with measles immunization at 9 months and for children aged 1\u20135 years, the subsequent nine doses of vitamin A supplementation are given twice a year, 6 months apart. Folic acid supplementation is also given to the population between the ages of 6\u201360 months and all women in reproductive age group. Besides supplementation, edible oils and milk are also fortified with vitamin A and D. In India, 18% of school-age children and 24% of adolescents in India have vitamin D deficiency (Serum 25[OH]D concentration < 12 ng/mL). Similarly, nearly 17% of school-age children and 31% of adolescents of age 10\u201319 years have vitamin B\n12 deficiency while almost 25% children have folate deficiency.\nXVI. Chapter Summary\nThe vitamins are summarized in Figure 32.29  on pp. 546\u2013548.Populations consuming diets high in fruits and vegetables show decreased incidence of some chronic diseases. However, clinical trials have failed to show a definitive benefit from supplements of folic acid; vitamins A, C, or E; or antioxidant combina-tions for the prevention of cancer or CVD. Subjects in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study trial who received high doses of vitamin E not only lacked cardiovascular benefit but also had an increased incidence of stroke.Relationship with Selenium\nSelenium is present in gluta-\nthione peroxidase, an impor-tant antioxidant enzyme. Selenium decreases the requirement of vitamin E and viceversa.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   545 24-10-2020   12:12:10"

What is the probable diagnosis?\nB. What is the cause of this condition?C. Why thiamine should be given before or with \nglucose in this condition?Answer\u2014B:  It is caused due to thiamine deficiency in \nchronic alcoholics. As the oral absorption of thiamine is impaired, thiamine is given parenterally as treatment.\nAnswer\u2014C:  If glucose is administered before or without \nthiamine, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome can be worsened or even precipitated. Since aerobic metabolism and the Krebs cycle is dependent on thiamine, if it is not present, anaerobic respiration will occur, increasing the levels of lactate.\nMultiple Choice Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nAnswers =  H, B, A, C, E.  Vitamin K is required for forma-\ntion of the \u03b3-carboxyglutamate residues in several proteins \nrequired for blood clotting. Consequently, a deficiency of vitamin K results in a tendency to bleed. Niacin deficiency is characterized by the three Ds: diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia (and death, a fourth D, if untreated). Folic acid deficiency can result in neural tube defects in the devel-oping fetus. Night blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency. Rod cells in the retina detect white and black images and work best in low light, for example, at night. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells, consists of 11-cis retinal bound to the protein opsin. Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine during collagen synthesis. Severe vitamin C defi-ciency (scurvy) results in defective connective tissue, char-acterized by sore and spongy gums, loose teeth, capillary fragility, anemia, and fatigue.For Questions 32.1\u201332.5, match the vitamin deficiency to \nthe clinical consequence.\nA.

The elevated Hcy and normal methylmalonic acid levels in the patient\u2019s blood reflect a deficiency of folic acid as the cause of the macrocytic anemia. Iron deficiency causes microcytic anemia, as can vitamin C deficiency.32.6. A 52-year-old woman presents with fatigue of \nseveral months\u2019 duration.

Vitamin D is required in the diet \nof individuals with limited exposure to sunlight, such as those living at northern latitudes like Maine and those with dark skin. Note that breast milk is low in vitamin D, and the lack of supplementation increases the risk of a defi-ciency. Vitamin D deficiency results in decreased synthesis of calbindin. Chronic kidney disease decreases production of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the active form of the vitamin. Vitamin D binds to nuclear receptors and alters gene transcription. Its effects are synergistic with parathyroid hormone.32.7.

They function in a number of processes including formation of bones and teeth, fluid balance, nerve conduction, muscle contraction, signaling, and catalysis. Several minerals are essential enzyme cofac-tors. Like the organic vitamins (see Chapter 32), minerals are micronutri-ents required in mg or \u03bcg amounts. Those required by adults in the largest \namounts (>100 mg/day) are referred to as the macrominerals. Minerals required in amounts between 1 and 100 mg/day are the microminerals (trace minerals). Ultratrace minerals are required in amounts <1 mg/day (\nFig. 33.1 ). [Note: The classification of specific minerals into these catego-\nries can vary among sources.] Mineral concentrations in the body are influ-enced by their rates of absorption and excretion.\nII. MACROMINERALS\nThe macrominerals include calcium (Ca2+), phosphorus ([P] as inorganic \nphosphate [P i, or PO 43\u2212]), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl\u2212), \nand potassium (K+).

Calcium and phosphorus\nThese macrominerals are considered together because they are compo-nents of hydroxylapatite (Ca\n5[PO 4]3OH), which makes up bones and teeth.\n 1.

Sources of calcium:  Dairy products, many green vegetables \n(for example, broccoli, but not spinach), and fortified orange juice are good dietary sources. Although dietary deficiency syndromes are unknown, average Ca\n2+ intake in the United \nStates is insufficient for optimal bone health.\nAbsorption of dietary calcium is affected by several factors. \nCalbindin is a vitamin D-induced intracellular Ca2+-binding \nprotein involved in Ca2+ absorption in the intestine (see p. 541). \nCalcitriol and parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase the absorp-tion of calcium, while oxalates, phytates and dietary fiber decrease its absorption (by forming insoluble complexes with calcium).\nToxicity is seen only with supplements (tolerable upper limit [UL] \n= 2,500 mg/day for adults).\nNormal serum calcium levels are 9\u201311 mg/dl, of which 50% is \nionized, 40% is bound to proteins and 10% is complexed with other anions, such as phosphate and bicarbonate.\nHypercalcemia (elevated serum Ca\n2+) can result from overpro-\nduction of PTH. This may cause constipation and kidney stones. Hypercalcemia of malignancy caused due to PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is another important cause of hypercalcemia seen in advanced malignancy.\nSymptoms of hypercalcemia include abdominal pain, vomiting \nand constipation, muscle weakness and tiredness, psychiatric disturbances, and renal stones.\nHypocalcemia (low serum Ca\n2+) can result from a deficiency \nof PTH or vitamin D. Chronic renal disease can also lead to hypocalcemia due to calcitriol deficiency. It can lead to bone demineralization (resorption). [Note: The hormonal regulation of serum Ca\n2+ levels was presented in the vitamin D section of \nChapter 32 and is reviewed in 3. below.]\n 2. Phosphorus:  Free phosphate (P i) is the most abundant intracel-\nlular anion. However, 85% of the body\u2019s phosphorus is in the form of inorganic hydroxylapatite, with most of the remainder in intracel-lular organic compounds such as phospholipids, nucleic acids, ATP , and creatine phosphate.\n a.

Sources:  Phosphorus is widely distributed in food (milk, meat, \neggs, and cereals are good sources), and dietary deficiency is rare.\nThe normal level of phosphorus is 2.5\u20134.5 mg/dl. \nHypophosphatemia can be caused by refeeding carbohy-drates to malnourished patients (refeeding syndrome, see p. 511), overuse of aluminum-containing antacids (aluminum chelates P\ni), and increased urinary loss in response to increased \nproduction of PTH (see below). Muscle weakness is a common symptom. Rickets-like features may be seen due to decreased mineralization of bones.\nHyperphosphatemia is caused primarily by decreased PTH \nlevels. Acute as well as chronic renal failure can also cause hyperphosphatemia. The excess P\ni can combine with Ca2+ and \nform crystals that deposit in soft tissue (metastatic calcifica-tion). [Note: The Ca\n2+/Pi ratio is important for bone formation \n(the ratio is ~2/1 in bone), and some experts are concerned that replacement of Ca\n2+-rich milk by Ca2+-poor, P i-rich soft drinks \ncan affect bone health.]\n 3. Hormonal regulation:  Serum levels of Ca2+ and P i are primarily \ncontrolled by calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D) and PTH, both of which respond to a decrease in serum Ca\n2+.\na.  Calcitriol, produced by the kidneys, increases serum Ca2+ and \nPi by increasing bone resorption, intestinal absorption, and renal \nreabsorption of Ca2+ and P i (Fig. 33.2 ).\nb.  PTH (from the parathyroid glands) increases serum Ca2+ by \nincreasing bone resorption, increasing renal reabsorption of Ca2+, \nand activating the renal 1-hydroxylase  that produces calcitriol \nfrom calcidiol (see p. 539) ( Fig. 33.3 ). In contrast to calcitriol, PTH \ndecreases P i reabsorption in the kidneys, lowering serum P i. High \nserum P i increases PTH and decreases calcitriol.\nc.  A third hormone, calcitonin (from the C cells of the thyroid gland), \nresponds to elevated serum Ca2+ levels by promoting bone \nmineralization and increasing renal excretion of Ca2+ (and P i).\nB. Magnesium\nAbout 60% of the body\u2019s Mg2+ is in bone, but it accounts for just 1% \nof the bone mass.

Mg2+ is \nwidely distributed in foods, but the average intake in the United States is below the recommended level. Nuts, whole grains, beans, and cereals are major sources.\nNormal serum concentration of magnesium is 1.6\u20132.3 mg/dl. \nHypomagnesemia can result from decreased absorption or increased excretion of Mg\n2+. Symptoms include hyperexcitability of skeletal \nmuscles and nerves and cardiac arrhythmias. With hypermagnesemia, hypotension is seen. [Note: Magnesium sulfate is used in the treatment of preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.]\nC. Sodium, chloride, and potassium\nThese macrominerals are considered together because they play impor-tant roles in several physiologic processes. For example, they maintain water balance, osmotic equilibrium, acid\u2013base balance (pH), and the electrical gradients across cell membranes (membrane potential) that are essential for the functioning of neurons and myocytes. [Note: These processes are discussed in Lippincott\u2019s Illustrated Reviews: Physiology.] Sodium and potassium are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.\n 1. Sodium and chloride:  Na\n+ and Cl\u2212 are primarily extracellular elec-\ntrolytes. Sodium is the most abundant cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and important determinant of the osmolality of the plasma.They are readily absorbed from foods containing salt (NaCl), much of which comes from processed foods. [Note: Na\n+ is required for the \nintestinal absorption (and renal reabsorption) of glucose and galac-tose (see p. 180) and free amino acids (see p. 381) by Na\n+-linked \ntransporters. Cl\u2212 is used to form hydrochloric acid required for \ndigestion (see p. 380).]\nNormal plasma level of sodium is 135\u2013145 mEq/L. The kidneys can \nconserve or excrete large amounts of sodium, depending on its concentration in the ECF and the blood volume. Aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) increase sodium reabsorp-tion in kidneys. WHO recommends a reduction in sodium intake to reduce blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart disease in adults to <2 g/day sodium (5 g/day salt) in adults.\n a. Hypertension:  Na\n+ intake is related to blood pressure (BP).\nIngestion of Na+ stimulates thirst centers in the brain and secre-\ntion of antidiuretic hormone from the pituitary, leading to water retention. This results in an increase in plasma volume and, consequently, an increase in BP . Chronic hypertension can damage the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. Modest reduc-tions in Na\n+ intake have been shown to result in modest reduc-\ntions in BP . [Note: Some populations (for example, African Americans) are \u201csalt sensitive\u201d and have larger responses to Na\n+.]\n b. Hyper- and hyponatremia:  Hypernatremia, typically caused by \nexcess loss of water relative to sodium loss, decreased water intake, or increased sodium intake or retention, and hypona-tremia, typically caused by decreased ability to excrete water, can result in severe brain damage. [Note: Chronic hyponatremia increases Ca\n2+ excretion and can result in osteoporosis (low \nbone mass).]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   554 24-10-2020   12:12:12"

Normal plasma concentration is \n100\u2013200 mg/dl. Meat, shellfish, nuts, and whole grains are good dietary sources of Cu. Dietary deficiency is uncommon. If a deficiency does develop, anemia may be seen because of the effect on Fe metabo-lism. Toxicity from dietary sources is rare (UL = 10 mg/day). Menkes syndrome and Wilson disease are genetic causes of Cu deficiency and Cu overload, respectively.\n 1. Menkes syndrome:  In Menkes syndrome (\u201ckinky hair\u201d disease), a \nrare X-linked (1:140,000 males) disorder, efflux of dietary Cu out of intestinal enterocytes into the circulation by a Cu-transporting ATPase  (ATP7A ) is impaired. This results in systemic Cu deficiency. \nConsequently, urinary and serum free (unbound) Cu are low, as is the concentration of ceruloplasmin , which carries over 90% of the \nCu in the circulation (\nFig. 33.6 ). Progressive neurologic degenera-\ntion and connective tissue disorders are seen, as are changes to hair. Parenteral administration of Cu has been used as a treatment with varying success. [Note: The mildest form of Menkes syndrome is called occipital horn syndrome.]\n 2. Wilson disease:  In Wilson disease, an autosomal-recessive (AR) \ndisorder affecting 1:35,000 live births, efflux of excess Cu from the liver by ATP7B  is impaired. Cu accumulates in the liver; leaks into \nthe blood; and is deposited in the brain, eyes, kidneys, and skin. In contrast to Menkes syndrome, urinary and serum free Cu are high (see \nFig. 33.6 ). Hepatic dysfunction and neurologic and psychiatric \nsymptoms are seen. Kayser-Fleischer rings (corneal deposits of Cu) may be present (\nFig. 33.7 ). Renal damage and hemolytic anemia \n(due to copper deposits in bone marrow) may also be seen. Life-long use of Cu-chelating agents, such as penicillamine, is the treatment.\nCeruloplasmin\nCeruloplasmin is a protein with ferroxidase activity. It is \nproduced in liver by incorporation of copper into apocerulo-plasmin (an alpha 2 globulin). It has eight copper atoms, four covalently bound and four loosely bound. Ceruloplasmin is also as an acute-phase reactant protein.\nThe bioavailability (percent of the amount ingested that is able to be absorbed) of a mineral can be influenced by other minerals. For example, excess Zn decreases the absorption of Cu, and Cu is needed for the absorption of Fe.\nB. Iron\nIron has several biochemical functions, such as:\n\u2022 It is a component of many proteins, both catalytic (for example, \nhydroxylases  such as prolyl hydroxylase , see p. 125) and noncata-\nlytic (such as transferrin, hemosiderin).\n\u2022 Iron can be linked to sulfur (S) as seen in the Fe\u2013S proteins of the \nelectron transport chain (see p. 165).High\nHighHigh\nA TP7BWhole-body Cu\nFree serum Cu\nUrinary Cu\nCu-transporting\nA TPase  affectedInheritance ARWILSON VARIABLE\nLow\nLowLow\nA TP7AX-linkedMENKES\nFigure 33.6\nComparison of Menkes syndrome \nand Wilson disease.

Dietary Fe is available as Fe2+ \nin heme (animal sources) and Fe3+ in nonheme sources (plants). Heme \niron is less abundant, but it is better absorbed. Also, plant sources contain inorganic molecules, such as phytates, which form complexes with iron and slow down its absorption.\nThe adult body typically contains 3\u20134 g of Fe. Meat, poultry, some \nshellfish, ready-to-eat cereals, lentils, and molasses are good dietary sources of Fe. Daily requirement is about 20 mg/day, of which about 10% is absorbed. This amount, ~1\u22122 mg/day, is sufficient to replace Fe lost from the body primarily by the sloughing of cells.\nThe requirement of iron is higher in women due to extra losses in \nmenstruation. Pregnancy and lactation also increase the iron require-ment due to uptake by developing fetus and for breastfeeding (breastfed babies are dependent on mother for their iron requirements). They require about 40 mg/day of dietary iron.\n 1. Absorption, storage, and transport:  Intestinal uptake of heme is \nby a heme carrier protein (\nFig. 33.8 ). Within the enterocytes, heme \noxygenase  releases Fe2+ from heme (see p. 420). Nonheme Fe is \ntaken up via the apical membrane protein divalent metal ion trans-porter-1 (DMT-1). [Note: Vitamin C enhances absorption of nonheme Fe because it is the coenzyme for duodenal cytochrome b  (Dcytb ), a \nferrireductase  that reduces Fe\n3+ to Fe2+.] Absorbed Fe2+ from heme \nand nonheme sources has two possible fates: It can be 1) oxidized to Fe\n3+ and stored by the intracellular protein ferritin (up to 4,500 \nFe3+/ferritin) or 2) transported out of the enterocyte by the baso-\nlateral membrane protein ferroportin, oxidized by the Cu-containing membrane protein hephaestin , and taken up by the plasma trans-\nport protein transferrin (2 Fe\n3+/transferrin), as shown in Figure 33.8 . \nFe2+\nFe2+Fe2+Fe    (nonheme iron)3+Heme\nHeme\nFe2+HCP\nTfDcytb\nHepcidinINTESTINAL LUMEN\nENTEROCYTE\nCIRCULATIONHeme\noxygenase\nFerritinFe3+\nFe3+\nFe3+Fe3+Heph FerroportinDMT-1Vitamin C\nFigure 33.8\nAbsorption, storage, and transport of dietary iron (Fe).

Micronutrients: Minerals\n[Note: Cells other than enterocytes use the Cu-containing plasma \nprotein ceruloplasmin  in place of hephaestin .] In normal individuals, \ntransferrin (Tf) is about one third saturated with Fe3+. Ferroportin, \nthe only known exporter of Fe from cells to the blood in humans, is regulated by the hepatic peptide hepcidin that induces internaliza-tion and lysosomal degradation of ferroportin. Therefore, hepcidin is the central molecule in Fe homeostasis. [Note: Transcription of hepcidin is suppressed when Fe is deficient.]\nMucosal block theory\nIntestinal absorption of iron is important regulator of iron \nstores in the body. As iron cannot be excreted but can be lost only through sloughing of cells or by blood loss, this regula-tion is important to prevent toxicity. Iron stored in enterocytes (as ferritin) is lost on shedding of mucosal cells, if not required by the body.\n 2. Recycling:  Macrophages phagocytose old and/or damaged red \nblood cells (RBC), freeing heme Fe that is sent out of the cells via ferroportin, oxidized by ceruloplasmin , and transported by Tf \nas described above. This recycled Fe meets ~90% of our daily need, which is predominantly for erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin, an alpha-2 globulin, binds to free Hb and prevents its loss in urine, thus conserving iron.\n 3. Uptake:  Tf-bound Fe\n3+ from enterocytes and macrophages binds \nto receptors (TfR) on erythroblasts and other Fe-requiring cells and is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The Fe\n3+ is released \nfrom Tf for use (or stored on ferritin), and the TfR (and Tf) is recy-cled in a process similar to the receptor-mediated endocytosis seen with low-density lipoprotein particles (see p. 354). [Note: Regulation of the translation of the messenger RNA for ferritin and the TfR by iron regulatory proteins and iron-responsive elements is discussed on p. 665.]\n 4. Deficiency:  Fe deficiency can result in a microcytic, hypochromic \nanemia (\nFig. 33.9 ), the most common anemia in the United States, \nas a result of decreased hemoglobin synthesis and, consequently, decreased RBC size. Treatment is the administration of Fe.\nIron deficiency can also cause achlorhydria due to atrophy of gastric \nepithelium. As achlorhydria reduces iron absorption, this further aggravates iron deficiency.\nCauses of iron deficiency are:\n\u2022 Poor nutritional intake\n\u2022 Decreased absorption: Achlorhydria (gastric acid promotes iron \nabsorption by reducing ferric ions)\n\u2022 Chronic blood loss: Hookworm infections, menorrhagia, hemor-\nrhoids, etc.\n 5. Excess:  Iron overload can occur with accidental ingestion. [Note: \nAcute Fe poisoning is the most common cause of poisoning deaths of children age <6 years (UL = 40 mg/day for children, 45 mg/day for adults).] People receiving repeated blood transfusions, such as those having thalassemia, are at risk for iron overload causing hemochro-matosis.

            "Text": "III. Microminerals (Trace Minerals) 559\n a. Hereditary hemochromatosis:  Overload can also occur with \ngenetic defects. An example is hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an AR disorder of iron overload found primarily in those of Northern European ancestry. It is most commonly caused by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hyperpigmentation with hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d)  and damage to the liver (a \nmajor storage site for Fe), pancreas, and heart may be seen. In HH, serum Fe and Tf saturation are elevated. Treatment is phle-botomy or use of Fe chelators. [Note: Fe overload is seen with mutations to proteins of Fe metabolism that result in inappropri-ately low levels of hepcidin. It can result in hemosiderosis.\n 6. Laboratory evaluation:  Iron status is evaluated by packed cell \nvolume, hemoglobin, red blood cell count and indices, total iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percent saturation, trans-ferrin, and ferritin.\nTotal iron and percent saturation are reduced in iron deficiency. \nTransferrin and TIBC are increased in iron deficiency and decreased in iron overload and hemochromatosis.\nC. Manganese\nMn is important for the function of several enzymes ( Fig. 33.10 ). Whole \ngrains, legumes (for example, beans and peas), nuts, and tea (espe-cially green tea) are good sources of the mineral. Consequently, Mn deficiency in humans is rare. Toxicity from foods and/or supplements is also rare (UL = 11 mg/day for adults).\nD. Zinc\nZn plays important structural and catalytic functions in the body. Zinc fingers are supersecondary structures (motifs, see p. 94) in proteins (for example, transcription factors) that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression (\nFig. 33.11 ). Hundreds of enzymes require Zn for activity. \nExamples include alcohol dehydrogenase , which oxidizes ethanol to \nacetaldehyde (see p. 445); carbonic anhydrase , which is important in \nthe bicarbonate buffer system (see p. 108); porphobilinogen synthase  \nof heme synthesis, which is inhibited by lead (lead replaces the zinc; see p. 416); and the nonmitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase  \n(SOD ), which also requires Cu (see \nFig. 33.5 ). Zinc is also required for \nDNA and RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase. Dietary sources of Zn include meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Phytates (phos-phate storage molecules in some plant products) irreversibly bind Zn in the intestine, decreasing its absorption, and can result in a deficiency. [Note: Phytates may also bind Ca\n2+ and nonheme Fe.] Several drugs \n(for example, penicillamine) chelate metals, and their use may cause Zn deficiency. [Note: Severe deficiency is seen with a defect in the intes-tinal transporter for Zn that results in the malabsorption disorder acro-dermatitis enteropathica. Symptoms include rashes, slowed growth and development, diarrhea, and immune deficiencies. Vision problems may also occur because Zn is needed in the metabolism of vitamin A.]\nEukaryotic cells infected with bacteria can restrict availability \nof the essential micronutrients Fe, Mn, and Zn to the patho-gens. This decreases the intracellular survival of the pathogen and is known as \u201cnutritional immunity.\u201dArginase-I\nPyruvate\ncarboxylase\nSuperoxide\ndismutase(mitochondrialform)Glycosyltrans-\nferasesHydrolyzes arginine\nto urea plus ornithinein the urea cycle(see p. 385)\nCarboxylates pyruvate to\nOAA in gluconeogenesis(see p. 217)Transfer sugars in\nproteoglycan synthesis(see p. 265)\nConverts superoxide\nto hydrogen peroxide(see p. 253)Mn-REQUIRING\nENZYMEFUNCTION\nFigure 33.10\nExamples of enzymes that require \nmanganese (Mn).

Cr poten-\ntiates the action of insulin by an unknown mechanism. It is found in fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and meat. F (as fluoride [F\n\u2212]) is added \nto water in many parts of the world to reduce the incidence of dental caries (\nFig. 33.12 ). F\u2212 replaces the hydroxyl group of hydroxylapatite, \nforming fluoroapatite that is more resistant to the enamel-dissolving acid produced by mouth bacteria. Excess of fluorine causes dental fluorosis characterized by discolored and mottled teeth. Higher levels can cause skeletal fluorosis (osteoporosis and calcification of tendons and ligaments).\nIV. ULTRATRACE MINERALS\nThe ultratrace minerals include iodine (I), selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo). They are required by adults in amounts <1 mg/day.\nA. Iodine\nI is utilized in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T\n3) and thyroxine (T 4) that are required for development, growth, and \nmetabolism. Dietary sources of iodine include dairy products, breads, seafood, and iodized salt. Upper regions of Himalayas are deficient in iodine and are called goitrous belt.\nCirculating iodide (I\n\u2212) is taken up (\u201ctrapped\u201d) and concentrated in \nthe epithelial follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It then is sent into the colloid of the follicular lumen where it is oxidized to iodine (I\n2) by \nthyroperoxidase  (TPO), as shown in Figure 33.13 . TPO then uses I 2 \nto iodinate selected tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin (Tg), forming monoiodinated tyrosine (MIT) and diiodinated tyrosine (DIT), as shown in \nFigure 33.14 .

The iodinated Tg is endo-\ncytosed and stored in follicular cells until needed, at which time it is proteolytically digested to release T\n3 and T 4, which are secreted into the \ncirculation (see Fig. 33.13 ). Under normal conditions, ~90% of secreted \nthyroid hormone is T 4 that is carried by transthyretin. In target tissues \n(for example, the liver and developing brain), T 4 is converted to T 3 (the \nmore active form) by Se-containing deiodinases . T3 binds to a nuclear \nreceptor that binds DNA at thyroid response elements and functions as a transcription factor. [Note: Thyroid hormone production is controlled by thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone ([TSH]) from the ante-rior pituitary. TSH secretion is itself controlled by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.]\nIodine is used in the contrast medium for computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scans and to visualize arteries during heart cath-eterization. It is also present in amiodarone, used to treat cardiac arrhythmias.\n 1. Hypothyroidism:  Underingestion of I can result in goiter (enlarge-\nment of the thyroid in response to excessive stimulation by TSH), as shown in \nFigure 33.15 . More severe deficiency results in hypothy-\nroidism that is characterized by fatigue, weight gain, decreased ther-mogenesis, and decreased metabolic rate (see p. 499). If hormone deficiency occurs during fetal and infant development (congenital hypothyroidism), irreversible intellectual disability (formerly called \u201ccretinism\u201d), hearing loss, spasticity, and short stature can result. [Note: Autoimmune destruction of TPO is a cause of Hashimoto \nthyroiditis (a primary hypothyroidism).]\n 2. Hyperthyroidism:  This condition is the result of overproduction \nof thyroid hormone. Although it can be caused by overingestion of I-containing supplements (UL = 1.1 g/day for adults), the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves\u2019 disease, in which an antibody that mimics the effect of TSH is produced, resulting in dysregulated production of thyroid hormone. This can cause nervousness, weight loss, increased perspiration and heart rate, protruding eyes (exophthalmos, \nFig. 33.16 ), and goiter.\nB. Selenium\nSe is present in ~25 human proteins (selenoproteins) as a constituent of the amino acid selenocysteine, which is derived from serine (see p. 403). Selenoproteins include glutathione peroxidase  that oxidizes \nglutathione in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, a ROS, to water (see p. 253); thioredoxin reductase  that reduces thioredoxin, a coenzyme of \nribonucleotide reductase  (see p. 579); and deiodinases  that remove I \nfrom thyroid hormones. Meat, dairy products, and grains are important dietary sources. Keshan disease, first identified in China, is a cardio-myopathy caused by eating foods produced from Se-deficient soil. Toxicity (selenosis) caused by overingestion of supplements causes brittle nails and hair. Cutaneous and neurologic effects may also be seen (UL = 400 \u03bcg in adults).HO\nHOI\nMonoiodotyrosine (MIT)\nDiiodotyrosine (DIT)I\nICH2Tg\nCH2\nFigure 33.14\nIodination of thyroglobulin (Tg) with \nproduction of MIT and DIT.\nFigure 33.15\nGoiter.\nFigure 33.16\nExophthalmos.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   561 24-10-2020   12:12:16"

Medical Perspectives\nMineral deficiencies, including deficiencies of iron, iodine, zinc and folic acid, are common among women and children \nin low- and middle-income countries. These deficiencies restrict survival, growth and development of children and also contribute to morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. It is important that mineral deficiency is detected early and managed.\nWhile dietary diversification is the most desirable way, supplementation and fortification of food items with minerals is \nalso done. Several governments run health programs to ensure that women of reproductive age, pregnant women and children have sufficient essential micronutrients.\nIron deficiency is the most significant cause of anemia worldwide. The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia was 53% \n(in 2015\u201316) for Indian women aged 15\u201349 years. In India, under the National Iron+ Initiative, the population between the ages of 6 to 60 months and all women in reproductive age group, are covered for supplementation of iron and folic acid. In populations with low calcium intake, calcium supplementation is recommended as part of the antenatal care for the prevention of preeclampsia in pregnant women.\nAlmost 20% of children suffer from zinc deficiency, which can lead to growth retardation, loss of appetite, and impaired \nimmune function. WHO recommends zinc supplementation for 10\u201314 days in children suffering from diarrhea, as zinc reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea and also prevents subsequent episodes.\nIn India, wheat and rice flour are fortified with iron, folic acid and vitamin B\n12 and salt is fortified with iron and iodine. It is \nestimated that with iodine fortification, about 240 million people, including 5.5 million newborns, are protected every year from the brain damage and learning ability losses associated with iodine deficiency.\nVI.

Hypernatremia \n(elevation of serum sodium) can lead to water reten-tion that can cause hypertension in salt-sensitive popu-lations (for example, African Americans). Chloride is the major extracellular anion. [Note: Sodium is the major extracellular cation, potassium is the major intracellular cation, and phosphate is the major intracellular anion. The concentration differential across the membrane is main-tained by active transport.] Carbohydrate metabolism involves the generation of phosphorylated intermediates. Refeeding severely malnourished individuals traps phos-phate and results in hypophosphatemia. Muscle weak-ness is a common symptom. Selenocysteine, an amino acid formed from serine and selenium, is found in proteins (selenoproteins) such as glutathione peroxidase, deiodin-ases, and thioredoxin reductase. Zinc fingers are a type of structural motif found in proteins (for example, tran-scription factors) that bind to DNA. Severe deficiency of zinc as a result of mutations to its intestinal transporter can result in acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is char-acterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and alopecia. Calcium is required for bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and blood clotting. Its deficiency will affect all of these processes. Thyroid hormones are iodin-ated tyrosines released by proteolytic digestion of thyro-globulin. Underingestion of iodine causes enlargement of the thyroid in an attempt to increase hormone synthesis. [Note: Goiter can also result if too much hormone is made, as in Graves disease, or if too little is made, as in Hashimoto disease. Both are autoimmune diseases.] Thyroid hormone increases the resting metabolic rate.For Questions 33.1\u201333.7, match the mineral to the most \nappropriate description.\nA. Calcium\nB. ChlorideC.

It also increases the renal reabsorption of calcium, because PTH activates the renal hydroxylase that converts calcidiol to calcitriol. PTH also increases the renal excretion of phosphate. With the hypo-parathyroidism of DiGeorge syndrome, all of these activi-ties of PTH are impaired. Consequently, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are seen.33.8. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital condition \nthat results in structural anomalies and failure of the thymus and parathyroid glands to develop.

Which one of the following is an expected clinical conse-quence of the deficiency in parathyroid hormone?\nA.  Increased bone resorption\nB.  Increased calcium reabsorption in the kidneyC.  Increased serum calcitriolD.  Increased serum phosphate\nCorrect answer = H.  The patient has Wilson disease, \nan autosomal-recessive disorder that decreases copper efflux from the liver because of mutations to the hepatic copper transport protein ATP7B. Some copper leaks into the blood and is deposited in the brain, eyes, kidney, and skin. This results in liver and kidney damage, neuro-logic effects, and corneal changes caused by the excess copper. Administration of the metal chelator penicillamine is the treatment. [Note: Because zinc is also chelated, supplementation with zinc is common.] Graves disease results in hyperthyroidism. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload. Keshan disease is the result of selenium deficiency, whereas selenosis is caused by sele-nium excess. Menkes syndrome is the result of a systemic deficiency in copper as a result of mutations to ATP7A, an intestinal copper transport protein.\nCorrect answer = B.  The patient has hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyper-glycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment.

The nucleotides, purines and pyrimidines are synthesized de novo  or reused.\n Genes are the fundamental unit of inheritance and their expression leads to RNA synthesis (Chapter 36) and protein \nformation (Chapter 37). However, gene expression is still an enigma as different cells express different genes (that is, make different proteins). The control of gene expression (Chapter 38) is understood in principle but not in entirety. Recombinant DNA technology (Chapter 39) deals with the ways in which human genome has been manipulated in the laboratory to assist in medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and production of medically required molecules like insulin.\nAs a primary healthcare physician, you will need to understand medical perspectives of genetics.\u2022 Single gene disorders which follow mendelian laws\u2014the disease may then be autosomal dominant (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis), autosomal recessive (e.g., albinism, cystic fibrosis) or X-linked dominant (e.g., vitamin D-resistant rickets), and X-linked recessive (e.g., hemophilia, color blindness).\n\u2022 Multifactorial disorders are the most common disorders, like diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension wherein the \ndisease occurrence depends on the environment and multiple gene interactions.

Without them, neither ribonucleic acid (RNA) nor deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) can be produced, and, therefore, proteins cannot be synthesized or cells proliferate. Nucleotides also serve as carriers of activated intermediates in the synthesis of some carbohydrates, lipids, and conju-gated proteins (for example, uridine diphosphate [UDP]-glucose and cytidine diphosphate [CDP]-choline) and are structural components of several essen-tial coenzymes, such as coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[H\n2]), \nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD[H]), and nicotinamide adenine dinu-cleotide phosphate (NADP[H]). Nucleotides, such as cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), serve as second messengers in signal transduction pathways. In addition, nucleotides play an important role as energy sources in the cell. Finally, nucleotides are important regulatory compounds for many of the pathways of intermediary metabolism, inhibiting or activating key enzymes. The purine and pyrimidine bases found in nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or can be obtained through salvage pathways that allow the reuse of the preformed bases resulting from normal cell turnover. [Note: Little of the purines and pyrimi-dines supplied by diet is utilized and is degraded instead.]\nII. STRUCTURE\nNucleotides are composed of a nitrogenous base; a pentose monosac-charide; and one, two, or three phosphate groups. The nitrogen-containing bases belong to two families of compounds: the purines and the pyrimidines.\nA.

T and U differ in that only T has a methyl group (\nFig. 34.1 ). Unusual (modified) bases are occasionally \nfound in some species of DNA (for example, in some viral DNA) and RNA (for example, in transfer RNA [tRNA]). Base modifications include methylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and reduction. Some examples of unusual bases are shown in \nFigure 34.2 . [Note: The presence of an \nunusual base in a nucleotide sequence may aid in its recognition by specific enzymes or protect it from being degraded by nucleases .]\nB. Nucleosides\nThe addition of a pentose sugar to a base through an N-glycosidic \nbond produces a nucleoside. If the sugar is ribose, a ribonucleoside is produced, and if the sugar is 2-deoxyribose, a deoxyribonucleoside is produced (\nFig. 34.3A ). The ribonucleosides of A, G, C, and U are named \nadenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine, respectively. The deoxy-ribonucleosides of A, G, C, and T have the added prefix deoxy- (for example, deoxyadenosine). [Note: The compound deoxythymidine is often simply called thymidine, with the deoxy- prefix being understood, because it is incorporated into DNA only.] The carbon and nitrogen atoms in the rings of the base and the sugar are numbered separately (see \nFig. 34.3B ). [Note: Carbons in the pentose are numbered 1 \u2032 to 5 \u2032. \nThus, when the 5 \u2032-carbon of a nucleoside (or nucleotide) is referred \nto, a carbon atom in the pentose, rather than an atom in the base, is being specified.]\nC. Nucleotides\nThe addition of one or more phosphate groups to a nucleoside produces a nucleotide. The first phosphate group is attached by an ester linkage to the 5 \u2032-OH of the pentose, forming a nucleoside 5 \u2032-phosphate or \na 5\u2032-nucleotide. The type of pentose is denoted by the prefix in the \nnames 5 \u2032-ribonucleotide and 5 \u2032-deoxyribonucleotide. If one phosphate \ngroup is attached to the 5 \u2032-carbon of the pentose, the structure is a \nnucleoside monophosphate, like adenosine monophosphate (AMP , or adenylate). If a second or third phosphate is added to the nucleoside, a nucleoside diphosphate (for example, adenosine diphosphate [ADP] or triphosphate, for example, ATP) results (\nFig. 34.4 ). The second and third \nphosphates are each connected to the nucleotide by a \u201chigh-energy bond\u201d (a bond with a large, negative change in free energy [\u2013\u0394G, see p. 160] of hydrolysis). [Note: The phosphate groups are responsible for the negative charges associated with nucleotides and cause DNA and RNA to be referred to as nucleic acids.]\nIII. PURINE NUCLEOTIDE SYNTHESIS\nThe atoms of the purine ring are contributed by a number of compounds, including amino acids (aspartate, glycine, and glutamine), carbon dioxide (CO\n2), and N10-formyltetrahydrofolate (N10-formyl-THF), as shown in \nFigure 34.5 . The purine ring is constructed primarily in the liver by a series \nof reactions that add the donated carbons and nitrogens to a preformed ribose 5-phosphate.

Purine Nucleotide Synthesis 575\nA. 5-Phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthesis\n5-Phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an activated pentose \nthat participates in the synthesis and salvage of purines and pyrimi-dines. Synthesis of PRPP from ATP and ribose 5-phosphate is catalyzed by PRPP synthetase  (\nFig. 34.6 ). This X-linked enzyme is activated by \ninorganic phosphate and inhibited by purine nucleotides (end-product inhibition). [Note: Because the sugar moiety of PRPP is ribose, ribo-nucleotides are the end products of de novo purine synthesis. When deoxyribonucleotides are required for DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar moiety is reduced (see p. 579).]\nB. 5-Phosphoribosylamine synthesis\nSynthesis of 5-phosphoribosylamine from PRPP and glutamine is shown in \nFigure 34.7 . The amide group of glutamine replaces the pyro-\nphosphate group attached to carbon 1 of PRPP . This is the committed step in purine nucleotide biosynthesis. The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction, glutamine:phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase  \n(GPAT ), is inhibited by the purine 5 \u2032-nucleotides AMP and guanosine \nmonophosphate (GMP , or guanylate), the end products of the pathway. The rate of the reaction is also controlled by the intracellular concen-tration of PRPP . [Note: The concentration of PRPP is normally far below the Michaelis constant (K\nm) for the GPAT . Therefore, any small change \nin the PRPP concentration causes a proportional change in rate of the reaction (see p. 141).]\nC. Inosine monophosphate synthesis\nThe next nine steps in purine nucleotide biosynthesis leading to the synthesis of inosine monophosphate ([IMP] whose base is hypoxan-thine) are illustrated in \nFigure 34.7 . IMP is the parent purine nucleotide \nfor AMP and GMP . Four steps in this pathway require ATP as an energy source, and two steps in the pathway require N\n10-formyl-THF as a one-\ncarbon donor (see p. 403). [Note: Hypoxanthine is found in tRNA (see Fig. 37.9 on p. 640).]\nD. Synthetic inhibitors\nSome synthetic inhibitors of purine synthesis (for example, the sulfon-amides) are designed to inhibit the growth of rapidly dividing microor-ganisms without interfering with human cell functions (see \nFig. 34.7 ). \nOther purine synthesis inhibitors, such as structural analogs of folic acid (for example, methotrexate), are used pharmacologically to control the spread of cancer by interfering with the synthesis of nucleotides and, therefore, of DNA and RNA (see \nFig. 34.7 ).\nInhibitors of human purine synthesis are extremely toxic to \ntissues, especially to developing structures such as in a fetus, or to cell types that normally replicate rapidly, including those of bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, immune system, or hair follicles. As a result, individuals taking such anticancer drugs can experience adverse effects, including anemia, scaly skin, GI tract disturbance, immunodeficiency, and hair loss.2-DeoxyriboseRNA DNA\nO\nCytidine DeoxyadenosineNH2\nNN\nO\nHO1234\n65\n1' 4'5'NH2\nNN\n3216\n45\nNN\n97\n8\n3' 2'A\nBRiboseHOH2C O\nOHOHOHO\nOHH\nHOHHOH2C\nO\nOH1' 4'5' HO\n3' 2'\nOH OH\nFigure 34.3\nA.

            "Text": "576 34. Nucleotide Metabolism\nE. Adenosine and guanosine monophosphate synthesis\nThe conversion of IMP to either AMP or GMP uses a two-step, energy- \nand nitrogen-requiring pathway ( Fig. 34.8 ). [Note: AMP synthesis \nrequires guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as an energy source and aspar-tate as a nitrogen source, whereas GMP synthesis requires ATP and glutamine.] Also, the first reaction in each pathway is inhibited by the end product of that pathway. This provides a mechanism for diverting IMP to the synthesis of the purine present in lesser amounts. If both AMP and GMP are present in adequate amounts, the de novo pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis is inhibited at the GPAT  step.\nF. Nucleoside di- and triphosphate synthesis\nNucleoside diphosphates are synthesized from the corresponding nucle-\noside monophosphates by base-specific nucleoside monophosphate \nkinases  (Fig. 34.9 ). [Note: These kinases  do not discriminate between \nribose or deoxyribose in the substrate.] ATP is generally the source of the transferred phosphate because it is present in higher concentrations than the other nucleoside triphosphates. Adenylate kinase  is particularly \nactive in the liver and in muscle, where the turnover of energy from ATP is high. Its function is to maintain equilibrium among the adenine nucleo-tides (AMP , ADP , and ATP). Nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates are interconverted by nucleoside diphosphate kinase , an enzyme that, \nunlike the monophosphate kinases , has broad substrate specificity.\nG. Purine salvage pathway\nPurines that result from the normal turnover of cellular nucleic acids, or \nthe small amount that is obtained from the diet and not degraded, can be converted to nucleoside triphosphates and used by the body. This is referred to as the salvage pathway for purines. [Note: Salvage is partic-ularly important in the brain.]\n 1. Purine base salvage to nucleotides:  Two enzymes are involved: \nadenine phosphoribosyltransferase  (APRT ) and X-linked hypoxan-\nthine\u2013guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  (HGPRT ). Both use PRPP \nas the source of the ribose 5-phosphate group (\nFig. 34.10 ). The \nrelease of pyrophosphate and its subsequent hydrolysis by pyro-\nphosphatase  makes these reactions irreversible. [Note: Adenosine \nis the only purine nucleoside to be salvaged.

The defi-\nciency results in an inability to salvage hypoxanthine or guanine, from which excessive amounts of uric acid, the end product of purine degradation, are then produced (see p. 580). In addition, the lack of this salvage pathway causes increased PRPP levels and decreased IMP and GMP levels. As a result, GPAT  (the regu-\nlated step in purine synthesis) has excess substrate and decreased inhibitors available, and de novo purine synthesis is increased. The combination of decreased purine reutilization and increased purine synthesis results in increased degradation of purines and the production of large amounts of uric acid, making HGPRT  deficiency \nan inherited cause of hyperuricemia. In patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, the hyperuricemia frequently results in the formation of uric acid stones in the kidneys (urolithiasis) and the deposition of urate crystals in the joints (gouty arthritis) and soft tissues.

[Note: The same enzyme acts on pyrimidine ribonucleotides.]\nA. Ribonucleotide reductase\nRibonucleotide reductase  (ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase ) is a \ndimer composed of two nonidentical subunits, R1 (or, \u03b1) and the smaller \nR2 (or, \u03b2), and is specific for the reduction of purine nucleoside diphos-\nphates (ADP and GDP) and pyrimidine nucleoside diphosphates (CDP and UDP) to their deoxy forms (dADP , dGDP , dCDP , and dUDP). The immediate donors of the hydrogen atoms needed for the reduction of the 2 \u2032-hydroxyl group are two sulfhydryl (\u2013SH) groups on the enzyme \nitself (R1 subunit), which form a disulfide bond during the reaction (see p. 94). [Note: R2 contains the stable tyrosyl radical required for catal-ysis at R1.]\n 1. Reduced enzyme regeneration:  In order for ribonucleotide reduc-\ntase to continue to produce deoxyribonucleotides at R1, the disul-\nfide bond created during the production of the 2 \u2032-deoxy carbon \nmust be reduced. The source of the reducing equivalents is thiore-doxin, a protein coenzyme of ribonucleotide reductase . Thioredoxin \ncontains two cysteine residues separated by two amino acids in the peptide chain. The two \u2013SH groups of thioredoxin donate their hydrogen atoms to ribonucleotide reductase , forming a disulfide \nbond in the process (\nFig. 34.12 ).\n 2. Reduced thioredoxin regeneration:  Thioredoxin must be converted \nback to its reduced form in order to continue performing its function. The reducing equivalents are provided by NADPH + H\n+, and the reac-\ntion is catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase , a selenoprotein.\nB. Deoxyribonucleotide synthesis regulation\nRibonucleotide reductase  is responsible for maintaining a balanced \nsupply of the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis. Consequently, the regulation of the enzyme is complex. In addition to the catalytic site, R1 contains two distinct allosteric sites involved in regulating enzymic activity (\nFig. 34.13 ).\n 1. Activity sites:  The binding of dATP to allosteric sites (known as \nactivity sites) on R1 inhibits the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme and, therefore, prevents the reduction of any of the four nucleoside diphosphates. This effectively prevents DNA synthesis and explains the toxicity of increased levels of dATP seen in condi-tions such as adenosine deaminase (ADA)  deficiency (see p. 583). \nIn contrast, ATP bound to these sites activates the enzyme.\n 2. Substrate specificity sites:  The binding of nucleoside triphosphates \nto additional allosteric sites (known as substrate specificity sites) on R1 regulates substrate specificity, causing an increase in the conver-sion of different species of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides as they are r equired for DNA synthesis. For example, deoxythymi-\ndine triphosphate binding at the specificity site causes a conforma-tional change that allows reduction of GDP to dGDP at the catalytic site when ATP is at the activity site.Figure 34.10\nSalvage pathways of purine nucleotide \nsynthesis.

The drug is an antineoplastic agent and is used in the treatment of cancers such as mela-noma. Hydroxyurea is also used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia (see p. 113). However, the increase in fetal hemo-globin seen with hydroxyurea is because of changes in gene expression and not to ribonucleotide reductase  inhibition.\nV. PURINE NUCLEOTIDE DEGRADATION\nDegradation of dietary nucleic acids occurs in the small intestine, where \npancreatic nucleases  hydrolyze them to nucleotides. The nucleotides are \nsequentially degraded by intestinal enzymes to nucleosides, phosphory-lated sugars, and free bases. Uric acid is the end product of intestinal purine degradation. [Note: Purine nucleotides from de novo synthesis are degraded in the liver primarily. The free bases are sent out from the liver and salvaged by peripheral tissues.]\nA. Degradation in the small intestine\nRibonucleases  and deoxyribonucleases , secreted by the pancreas, \nhydrolyze dietary RNA and DNA to oligonucleotides that are further hydrolyzed by pancreatic phosphodiesterases , producing a mixture of \n3\u2032- and 5 \u2032-mononucleotides. At the intestinal mucosal surface, nucleo-\ntidases  remove the phosphate groups hydrolytically, releasing nucleo-\nsides that are taken into enterocytes by sodium-dependent transporters and degraded by nucleosidases  (nucleoside phosphorylases ) to free \nbases plus (deoxy) ribose 1-phosphate. Dietary purine bases are not used to any appreciable extent for the synthesis of tissue nucleic acids. Instead, they are degraded to uric acid in the enterocytes. Most of the uric acid enters the blood and is eventually excreted in the urine. A summary of this pathway is shown in \nFigure 34.14 . [Note: Mammals \nother than primates express urate oxidase  (uricase ), which cleaves the \npurine ring, generating allantoin.

Diseases associated with purine degradation\n 1. Gout:  Gout is a disorder initiated by high levels of uric acid (the end \nproduct of purine catabolism) in blood (hyperuricemia), as a result of either the overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. The hyper-uricemia can lead to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints and an inflammatory response to the crystals, causing first acute and then progressing to chronic gouty arthritis. Nodular masses of MSU crystals (tophi) may be deposited in the soft tissues, resulting in chronic tophaceous gout (\nFig. 34.16 ). Formation \nof uric acid stones in the kidney (urolithiasis) may also be seen. [Note: Hyperuricemia is not sufficient to cause gout, but gout is always preceded by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically asymptomatic but may be indicative of comorbid conditions such as hypertension.] The definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration and examination of synovial fluid (\nFig. 34.17 ) from an affected joint (or material from a \ntophus) using polarized light microscopy to confirm the presence of needle-shaped MSU crystals (\nFig. 34.18 ).\n a. Uric acid underexcretion:  In >90% of individuals with hyperuri-\ncemia, the cause is underexcretion of uric acid. Underexcretion can be primary, because of as-yet-unidentified inherent excre-tory defects, or secondary to known disease processes that affect how the kidney handles urate (for example, in lactic acidosis, lactate increases renal urate reabsorption, thereby decreasing its excretion) and to environmental factors such as the use of drugs (for example, thiazide diuretics) or exposure to lead (saturnine gout).\n b. Uric acid overproduction:  A less common cause of hyperuri-\ncemia is from the overproduction of uric acid. Primary hyper-uricemia is, for the most part, idiopathic (having no known cause). However, several identified mutations in the gene for X-linked PRPP synthetase  result in the enzyme having an \nincreased maximal velocity ([V\nmax], see p. 139) for the produc-\ntion of PRPP , a lower K m (see p. 141) for ribose 5-phosphate, \nor a decreased sensitivity to purine nucleotides, its allosteric inhibitors (see p. 144). In each case, increased availability of PRPP increases purine production, resulting in elevated levels of plasma uric acid. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (see p. 579) also causes hyperuricemia as a result of the decreased salvage of hypoxanthine and guanine and the subsequent increased availability of PRPP . Secondary hyperuricemia is typically the consequence of increased availability of purines (for example, in patients with myeloproliferative disorders or who are under-going chemotherapy and so have a high rate of cell turnover). Hyperuricemia can also be the result of seemingly unrelated metabolic diseases, such as von Gierke disease (see Fig. 16.8, p. 231) or hereditary fructose intolerance (see p. 241).\nA diet rich in meat, seafood (particularly shellfish), and ethanol \nis associated with increased risk of gout, whereas a diet rich in low-fat dairy products is associated with a decreased risk.SMALL\nINTESTINELow pH\ndenatures DNA \nand RNA\nDenatured\nnucleic acids\nNucleases\nOligonucleotides\nPhosphodiesterases\nMononucleotides\nNucleotidases\nNucleosidasesNucleosidesNucleosides\nPyrimidine\n bases\nPurine bases\nENTEROCYTEMOUTH\nDNA RNADNA\nRNA\nPi\nUric acid\nURINEPANCREASPANCREASSTOMACHSTOMACH\nCIRCULATION\n++(Deoxy) Ribose\n1-phosphate\nFigure 34.14\nDigestion of dietary nucleic acids. \nPi = inorganic phosphate.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   581 24-10-2020   12:12:24"

[Note: Colchicine prevents formation of microtubules, thereby decreasing the movement of neutrophils into the affected area.

Allopurinol, a structural analog of hypo-xanthine, inhibits uric acid synthesis and is used in patients who are overproducers of uric acid. Allopurinol is oxidized to oxypu-rinol, a long-lived inhibitor of XO. This results in an accumula-\ntion of hypoxanthine and xanthine (see \nFig. 34.15 ), compounds \nmore soluble than uric acid and, therefore, less likely to initiate an inflammatory response.

Adenosine deaminase deficiency:  ADA is expressed in a variety \nof tissues, but, in humans, lymphocytes have the highest activity of this cytoplasmic enzyme. A deficiency of ADA results in an accu-\nmulation of adenosine, which is converted to its ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide forms by cellular kinases .

Consequently, cells cannot make DNA and divide. [Note: The dATP and adenosine that accumulate in ADA deficiency lead to devel-\nopmental arrest and apoptosis of lymphocytes.] In its most severe form, this autosomal-recessive disorder causes a type of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), involving a decrease in T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. ADA deficiency accounts \nfor ~14% of cases of SCID in the United States. Treatments include bone marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, and gene therapy (see p. 696). Without appropriate treatment, children with this disorder usually die from infection by age 2 years. [Note: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase  deficiency results in a less severe \nimmunodeficiency primarily involving T cells.]\nVI. PYRIMIDINE SYNTHESIS AND DEGRADATION\nUnlike the synthesis of the purine ring, which is constructed on a pre-existing ribose 5-phosphate, the pyrimidine ring is synthesized before being attached to ribose 5-phosphate, which is donated by PRPP . The sources of the atoms in the pyrimidine ring are glutamine, CO\n2, and aspar-\ntate ( Fig. 34.19 ).\nA. Carbamoyl phosphate synthesis\nThe regulated step of this pathway in mammalian cells is the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO\n2, catalyzed by \ncarbamoyl phosphate synthetase  (CPS) II. CPS II  is inhibited by uridine \ntriphosphate (the end product of this pathway, which can be converted into the other pyrimidine nucleotides) and is activated by PRPP . [Note: Carbamoyl phosphate, synthesized by CPS I , is also a precursor of \nurea (see p. 385). Defects in ornithine transcarbamylase  of the urea \ncycle promote pyrimidine synthesis because of increased availability of \nFigure 34.16\nTophaceous gout.\nArthrocentesis: Joint aspiration \nis a procedure whereby a sterile \nneedle and syringe are used \nto drain fluid from a joint.\nFigure 34.17\nAnalysis of joint fluid can help to define \ncauses of joint swelling and arthritis, such as infection, gout, and rheumatoid disease.\nFigure 34.18\nGout can be diagnosed by the presence of negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals in aspirated synovial fluid examined by polarized light microscopy.

Orotic acid synthesis\nThe second step in pyrimidine synthesis is the formation of carbamo-ylaspartate, catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase . The pyrimidine \nring is then closed by dihydroorotase . The resulting dihydroorotate is \noxidized to produce orotic acid (orotate), as shown in \nFigure 34.21 . The \nhuman enzyme that produces orotate, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase , \nis a flavin mononucleotide-containing protein of the inner mitochon-drial membrane. All other enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis are cyto-solic. [Note: The first three enzymic activities in this pathway ( CPS II , \naspartate transcarbamoylase , and dihydroorotase ) are actually three \ndifferent catalytic domains of a single polypeptide known as CAD  from \nthe first letter in the name of each domain. (See p. 94 for a discus-sion of domains.) This is an example of a multifunctional or multicata-lytic polypeptide that facilitates the ordered synthesis of an important compound. Synthesis of the purine nucleotide IMP also involves multi-functional proteins.]\nC. Pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis\nThe completed pyrimidine ring is converted to the nucleotide oroti-dine monophosphate (OMP) in the second stage of pyrimidine nucle-otide synthesis (see \nFig. 34.21 ). As seen with the purines, PRPP is the \nribose 5-phosphate donor. The enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltrans-\nferase  produces OMP and releases pyrophosphate, thereby making \nthe reaction biologically irreversible. [Note: Both purine and pyrimi-dine synthesis require glutamine, aspartic acid, and PRPP as essential precursors.] OMP (orotidylate) is decarboxylated to uridine monophos-phate (UMP) by orotidylate decarboxylase . The phosphoribosyltrans-\nferase  and decarboxylase  activities are separate catalytic domains \nof a single polypeptide called UMP synthase . Hereditary orotic acid-\nuria (a very rare disorder) may be caused by a deficiency of one or both activities of this bifunctional enzyme, resulting in orotic acid in the urine (see \nFig. 34.21 ). UMP is sequentially phosphorylated to UDP \nand UTP . [Note: The UDP is a substrate for ribonucleotide reductase , \nwhich generates dUDP . The dUDP is phosphorylated to dUTP , which is rapidly hydrolyzed to dUMP by UTP diphosphatase  (dUTPase ). Thus, \ndUTPase  plays an important role in reducing availability of dUTP as a \nsubstrate for DNA synthesis, thereby preventing erroneous incorpora-tion of uracil into DNA.]\nD. Cytidine triphosphate synthesis\nCytidine triphosphate (CTP) is produced by amination of UTP by CTP \nsynthetase  (Fig. 34.22 ), with glutamine providing the nitrogen. Some of \nthis CTP is dephosphorylated to CDP , which is a substrate for ribonu-\ncleotide reductase . The dCDP product can be phosphorylated to dCTP \nfor DNA synthesis or dephosphorylated to dCMP that is deaminated to dUMP .\nE.

This is an unusual reaction in that \nTHF contributes not only a one-carbon unit but also two hydrogen atoms from the pteridine ring, resulting in the oxidation of THF to dihydrofolate ([DHF], \nFig. 34.23 ). Inhibitors of thymidylate synthase  \ninclude thymine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, which serve as anti-tumor agents. 5-Fluorouracil is metabolically converted to 5-fluorode-oxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), which becomes permanently bound to the inactivated thymidylate synthase , making the drug a \nsuicide inhibitor (see p. 142). DHF can be reduced to THF by dihydro-\nfolate reductase  (see Fig. 32.2, p. 523), an enzyme that is inhibited by \nfolate analogs such as methotrexate. By decreasing the supply of THF , these drugs not only inhibit purine synthesis (see \nFig. 34.7 ), but, by \npreventing methylation of dUMP to dTMP , they also decrease the avail-ability of this essential component of DNA.

Chapter Summary\nNucleotides  are composed of a nitrogenous base  (adenine  = A, guanine  = G, cytosine  = C, uracil  = U, and thymine  = T); \na pentose sugar ; and one, two, or three phosphate groups  (Fig. 34.24 ). A and G are purines , and C, U, and T are pyrim-\nidines . If the sugar is ribose , the nucleotide is a ribonucleoside phosphate  (for example, adenosine monophosphate \n[AMP]), and it can have several functions in the cell, including being a component of RNA . If the sugar is deoxyribose , \nthe nucleotide is a deoxyribonucleoside phosphate  (for example, deoxyAMP) and will be found almost exclusively as \na component of DNA . The committed step  in purine synthesis  uses 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate  ([PRPP ], \nan activated pentose that provides the ribose 5-phosphate  for de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis and salvage) \nand nitrogen from glutamine  to produce phosphoribosylamine. The enzyme is glutamine:phosphoribosylpyrophosp\nhate amidotransferase  and is inhibited by AMP and guanosine monophosphate (the end products of the pathway) and \nactivated by PRPP . Purine nucleotides can also be produced from preformed purine bases by using salvage reactions  \ncatalyzed by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase  (APRT ) and hypoxanthine\u2013guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  \n(HGPRT ). A near-total deficiency of HGPRT  causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome , a severe, inherited form of hyperuricemia \naccompanied by compulsive self-mutilation. All deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized from ribonucleotides by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase . This enzyme is highly regulated (for example, it is strongly inhibited by deoxyadenosine \ntriphosphate  [dATP ], a compound that is overproduced in bone marrow cells in individuals with adenosine deaminase  \n[ADA ] deficiency ). ADA deficiency causes severe combined immunodeficiency disease . The end product of purine \ndegradation is uric acid , a compound of low solubility whose overproduction or undersecretion causes hyperuricemia  \nthat, if accompanied by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals  in joints and soft tissues and an inflammatory \nresponse to those crystals, results in gout . The first step in pyrimidine synthesis , the production of carbamoyl phos-\nphate by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II , is the regulated  step in this pathway (it is inhibited by uridine triphos-\nphate  [UTP] and activated by PRPP). The UTP produced by this pathway can be converted to cytidine triphosphate. \nDeoxyuridine monophosphate can be converted to deoxythymidine monophosphate  by thymidylate synthase\n, an \nenzyme targeted by anticancer drugs such as 5-fluorouracil . The regeneration of tetrahydrofolate  from dihydrofolate \nproduced in the thymidylate synthase  reaction requires dihydrofolate reductase , an enzyme targeted by the drug meth-\notrexate . Pyrimidine degradation results in soluble products.dTMPDihydrofolate\nreductaseNADPH + H+\nNADP+\nTetrahydrofolateDihydrofolate\nMetho-\ntrexate5-FdUMPN5,N10-Methylene-\ntetrahydrofolate\n5-Fluorouracil\nThymidylate \nsynthasedCMPdCDP\nPi\ndUMPdUDP\nPiNH3\nFigure 34.23\nSynthesis of dTMP from dUMP , \nillustrating sites of action of antineoplastic drugs.VII. Medical Perspectives \nGout is a common disorder of purine degradation. It is characterized by \na high uric acid in blood (normal levels: males 3.4\u20137 mg/dl and females 2.5\u20136 mg/dl) leading to symptoms of gouty arthritis  (pain and swelling in \njoints of big toe, ankles, feet). It is treated with anti-inflammatory medica-tion and allopurinol. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase  and therefore the \nconversion of xanthine to uric acid.\nDrugs Acting on Purine Nucleotides\nSulfonamides  interfere with folic acid synthesis of bacteria by preventing \naddition of para-aminobenzoic acid into the pteridine precursor by competing for the enzyme, dihydropteroate synthetase . Humans cannot \nsynthesize folic acid and hence interference by sulpha drugs is not possible here.\nMethotrexate acts on growing cancer cells as well as normal cells by inhib-\niting the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate in human cells. Hence, this treatment of cancers comes with side effects.to highly soluble products, \u03b2-alanine (from the degradation of CMP and \nUMP) and \u03b2-aminoisobutyrate (from TMP degradation), with the produc-\ntion of ammonia and CO 2. Pyrimidine bases can be salvaged to nucle-\nosides, which are phosphorylated to nucleotides. However, their high solubility makes pyrimidine salvage less significant clinically than purine salvage. [Note: The salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides is the basis for using uridine in the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria (see p. 584).]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   586 24-10-2020   12:12:29"

The patient\u2019s pain is caused by gout, \nresulting from an inflammatory response to the crystalliza-tion of excess urate (as monosodium urate) in his joints. Radiation therapy caused cell death, with degradation of nucleic acids and their constituent purines. Uric acid, the end product of purine degradation, is a relatively insol-uble compound that can cause gout (and kidney stones). Pyrimidine metabolism is not associated with uric acid production. Overproduction of purines can indirectly result in hyperuricemia. Purine salvage decreases uric acid production.34.2.

Methotrexate interferes with folate \nmetabolism by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This starves cells for tetrahydrofolate and makes them unable to synthesize purines and thymidine monophosphate. Inosine mono-phosphate dehydrogenase  is inhibited by mycophenolic \nacid. Ribonucleotide reductase  is inhibited by hydroxy-\nurea. Thymidylate synthase  is inhibited by 5-fluorouracil. \nXanthine oxidase  is inhibited by allopurinol.

Xanthine oxidase\u2014probenecid\nCorrect answer = E.  The elevated excretion of orotic \nacid and low activity of uridine monophosphate (UMP) synthase indicate that the patient has orotic aciduria, a very rare genetic disorder affecting de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Deficiencies in one or both catalytic domains of UMP synthase leave the patient unable to synthesize pyrimidines. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, is a useful treatment because it bypasses the missing activities and can be salvaged to UMP , which can be converted to all the other pyrimidines. Although thymidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside, it cannot be converted to other pyrimidines. Hypoxanthine, guanine, and adenine are all purine bases and cannot be converted to pyrimidines.34.4.

There are two chemically distinct types of nucleic acids: deoxyribo-nucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid ([RNA], see Chapter 36). DNA, the repository of genetic information (or, genome), is present not only in chro-mosomes in the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms, but also in prokaryotic cells which lack nuclei and have a single chromosome. Further, prokaryotic cells may contain non-chromosomal DNA in form of plasmids.\nThe genetic information found in DNA is copied and transmitted to \ndaughter cells through DNA replication. The DNA contained in a fertilized egg encodes the information that directs the development of an organism. This development may involve the production of billions of cells. Each cell is specialized, expressing only those functions that are required for it to perform its role in maintaining the organism. Therefore, DNA must be able not only to replicate precisely each time a cell divides, but also to have the information that it contains be selectively expressed. Further, any error made in the new copy during DNA replication must be zealously corrected as altering of the genome is a serious issue. Hence there are DNA repair mechanisms.\nThe flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein is termed \nthe \u201ccentral dogma\u201d of molecular biology ( Fig. 35.1 ) and is \ndescriptive of all organisms, with the exception of some viruses that have RNA as the repository of their genetic information.\n Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, a student will be able to\n\u2022 Describe the structure, organization and function of prokaryotic and \neukaryotic DNA\n\u2022 Describe the processes involved in replication of DNA\u2022 Explain the DNA repair mechanisms\u2022 Discuss how this knowledge may be used for diagnosis and treatment\nFigure 35.1\nThe \u201ccentral dogma\u201d of molecular \nbiology.DNA\nRNA\nTranslation\nPROTEINReplication\nTranscription\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   590 24-10-2020   12:12:31"

DNA STRUCTURE\nDNA is the chemical basis of heredity, whereas a gene is the fundamental \nunit of genetic information.\nDNA consists of\n\u2022 Bases\n \u2013Purines: Adenine and Guanine\n \u2013Pyrimidines: Cytosine and Thymine\n\u2022 Deoxyribose sugar\nNucleosides are derivatives of purines and pyrimidines that are linked to a \nsugar through a ring nitrogen. Nucleotides are phosphorylated nucleotides, i.e., adenosine monophosphate (AMP).\nDNA is a polymer of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (dNMP) cova-\nlently linked by 3 \u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bonds. With the exception of a few \nviruses that contain single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), DNA exists as a double-stranded molecule (dsDNA), in which the two strands wind around each other, forming a double helix. [Note: The sequence of the linked dNMP is primary structure, whereas the double helix is secondary structure.] In eukaryotic cells, DNA is found associated with various types of proteins (known collectively as nucleoprotein) present in the nucleus, whereas the protein\u2013DNA complex is present in a non\u2013membrane-bound region known as the nucleoid in prokaryotes.\nA. 3\u2032\u21925\u2032-Phosphodiester bonds\nPhosphodiester bonds join the 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the deoxypen-\ntose of one nucleotide to the 5 \u2032-hydroxyl group of the deoxypen-\ntose of an adjacent nucleotide through a phosphoryl group ( Fig. 35.2 ). \nThe resulting long, unbranched chain has polarity, with both a 5 \u2032-end \n(the end with the free phosphate) and a 3 \u2032-end (the end with the free \nhydroxyl) that are not attached to other nucleotides. By convention, the bases located along the resulting deoxyribose-phosphate back-bone are always written in sequence from the 5 \u2032-end of the chain to \nthe 3 \u2032-end. For example, the sequence of bases in the DNA shown \nin \nFigure 35.2D  (5\u2032-TACG-3 \u2032) is read \u201cthymine, adenine, cytosine, \nguanine.\u201d Phosphodiester linkages between nucleotides can be hydro-lyzed enzymatically by a family of nucleases , deoxyribonucleases  for \nDNA and ribonucleases  for RNA, or cleaved hydrolytically by chemicals. \n[Note: Only RNA is cleaved by alkali.]\nB. Double helix\nIn the double helix, the two chains are coiled around a common axis called the helical axis. The chains are paired in an antiparallel manner (that is, the 5 \u2032-end of one strand is paired with the 3 \u2032-end of the other \nstrand), as shown in \nFigure 35.3 . In the DNA helix, the hydrophilic deoxy-\nribose-phosphate backbone of each chain is on the outside of the mole-cule, whereas the hydrophobic bases are stacked inside. The overall structure resembles a twisted ladder. The spatial relationship between the two strands in the helix creates a major (wide) groove and a minor (narrow) groove. These grooves provide access for the binding of regula-tory proteins to their specific recognition sequences along the DNA chain.\n 1. Base-pairing:  The bases of one strand of DNA are paired with the \nbases of the second strand, so that an adenine (A) is always paired \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   591 24-10-2020   12:12:32"

[Note: The base pairs are perpendicular to the helical axis (see \nFig. 35.3 ).] Therefore, one polynucleotide chain of the DNA double \nhelix is always the complement of the other. Given the sequence of bases on one chain, the sequence of bases on the complementary chain can be determined (\nFig. 35.4 ). [Note: The specific base-pairing \nin DNA leads to the Chargaff rule, which states that in any sample of dsDNA, the amount of A equals the amount of T, the amount of G equals the amount of C, and the total amount of purines (A + G) equals the total amount of pyrimidines (T + C).] The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds: two between A and T and three between G and C (\nFig. 35.5 ). These hydrogen bonds, plus the \nhydrophobic interactions between the stacked bases, stabilize the structure of the double helix.\n 2. DNA strand separation:  The two strands of the double helix sepa-\nrate when hydrogen bonds between the paired bases are disrupted. Disruption can occur in the laboratory if the pH of the DNA solu-tion is altered so that the nucleotide bases ionize, or if the solution is heated.

[Note: \nssDNA has a higher relative absorbance at this wavelength than does dsDNA.] Because there are three hydrogen bonds between G and C but only two between A and T, DNA that contains high concentrations of A and T denatures at a lower temperature than does G- and C-rich DNA (\nFig. 35.6 ). Under appropriate conditions, \ncomplementary DNA strands can reform the double helix by the process called renaturation (or, reannealing). [Note: Separation of the two strands over short regions occurs during both DNA and RNA synthesis.]\n 3. Structural forms:  The structural forms of DNA are A-DNA, B-DNA \nand Z-DNA. Their salient features are given in \nFigure 35.7 .\nC. Linear and circular DNA molecules\nEach chromosome in the nucleus of a eukaryote consists of one long, linear molecule of dsDNA, which is bound by a complex mixture of proteins (histone and nonhistone, see p. 603) to form chromatin. Eukaryotes have closed, circular, dsDNA molecules in their mitochon-dria, as do plant chloroplasts. A prokaryotic organism typically contains a single, circular, dsDNA molecule. [Note: Circular DNA is \u201csupercoiled,\u201d that is, the double helix crosses over on itself one or more times. Supercoiling can result in overwinding (positive supercoiling) or under-winding (negative supercoiling) of DNA. Supercoiling, a type of tertiary structure, compacts DNA.] Each prokaryotic chromosome is associated with nonhistone proteins that help compact the DNA to form a nucleoid. In addition, most species of bacteria also contain small, circular, extra-chromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids. Plasmid DNA carries genetic information and undergoes replication that may or may not be synchronized to chromosomal division. [Note: The use of plasmids as vectors in recombinant DNA technology is described in Chapter 39.]\nPlasmids may carry genes that convey antibiotic resistance to \nthe host bacterium and may facilitate the transfer of genetic information from one bacterium to another.\n \nIII. STEPS IN PROKARYOTIC DNA REPLICATION\nWhen the two strands of dsDNA are separated, each can serve as a \ntemplate for the replication (synthesis) of a new complementary strand. This produces two daughter molecules, each of which contains two DNA strands (one old, one new) in an antiparallel orientation (see \nFig. 35.3 ). \nThis process is called semiconservative replication because, although the parental duplex is separated into two halves (and, therefore, is not conserved as an entity), each of the parental strands remains intact in one of the two new duplexes (\nFig. 35.8 ). The enzymes involved in DNA replica-\ntion are template-directed, magnesium (Mg2+)-requiring polymerases  that \ncan synthesize the complementary sequence of each strand with extraor-dinary fidelity. The reactions described in this section were first known from studies of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the description given below refers to the process in prokaryotes. DNA synthesis in higher organ-isms is more complex but involves the same types of mechanisms. In either case, initiation of DNA replication commits the cell to continue the process until the entire genome has been replicated.A = T\nC = G\nC = G\nT = A\nG = C\nA = T\nT = A\nC = G\nA = T\nG = C\nT = AC = GBase pairs\nperpendicular to the\nhelical axisMinor\ngroove\nMajor\ngrooveHelical axis\n5\u02b9-End\n3\u02b9-End5\u02b9-EndDeoxyribose-\nphosphate\nbackbone3\u02b9-End\nFigure 35.3\nDNA double helix, illustrating some of its \nmajor structural features.\n5\u02b9\n5\u02b9 3\u02b93\u02b9Base pairs\nHydrogen\nbonds5\u02b9\n5\u02b95\u02b9\n5\u02b9\n5\u02b9\n5\u02b93\u02b9\n3\u02b9\n3\u02b93\u02b9Deoxyribose-\nphosphate\nbackboneDeoxyribose-\nphosphate\nbackbone\nA\nAT\nTC GP\nP\nPP\nP\nP\nP3\u02b9\n3\u02b9\nFigure 35.4\nTwo complementary DNA sequences. \nT = thymine; A = adenine; C = cytosine; G = guanine.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   593 24-10-2020   12:12:33"

Complementary strand separation\nIn order for the two complementary strands of the parental dsDNA to be replicated, they must first separate (or \u201cmelt\u201d) over a small region, because the polymerases  use only ssDNA as a template. In prokary-\notic organisms, DNA replication begins at a single, unique nucle-otide sequence, a site called the origin of replication, or ori (oriC in E. coli), as shown in \nFigure 35.9A . [Note: This sequence is referred to \nas a consensus sequence, because the order of nucleotides is essen-tially the same at each site.] The ori includes short, AT-rich segments that facilitate melting. In eukaryotes, replication begins at multiple sites along the DNA helix (\nFig. 35.9B ). Having multiple origins of replication \nprovides a mechanism for rapidly replicating the great length of eukary-otic DNA molecules.\nB. Replication fork formation\nAs the two strands unwind and separate, synthesis occurs at two repli-cation forks that move away from the origin in opposite directions (bidi-rectionally), generating a replication bubble (see \nFig. 35.9 ).

Required proteins:  Initiation of DNA replication requires the recog-\nnition of the origin (start site) by a group of proteins that form the prepriming complex. These proteins are responsible for melting at the ori, maintaining the separation of the parental strands, and unwinding the double helix ahead of the advancing replication fork. In E. coli, these proteins include the following.\n a. DnaA protein:  DnaA  protein initiates replication by binding \nto specific nucleotide sequences ( DnaA  boxes) within oriC. \nBinding causes an AT-rich region (the DNA unwinding element) in the origin to melt. Melting (strand separation) results in a short, localized region of ssDNA.\n b. DNA helicases:  These enzymes bind to ssDNA near the repli-\ncation fork and then move into the neighboring double-stranded region, forcing the strands apart (in effect, unwinding the double helix). Helicases  require energy provided by ATP hydrolysis (see \nFig. 35.10 ). Unwinding at the replication fork causes super-\ncoiling in other regions of the DNA molecule. [Note: DnaB  is the \nprincipal helicase  of replication in E. coli. Binding of this hexa-\nmeric protein to DNA requires DnaC .]\n c. Single-stranded DNA\u2013binding protein:  This protein binds to \nthe ssDNA generated by helicases  (see Fig. 35.10 ). Binding \nis cooperative (that is, the binding of one molecule of single-stranded binding [SSB] protein makes it easier for additional molecules of SSB protein to bind tightly to the DNA strand). The SSB proteins are not enzymes, but rather serve to shift the equilibrium between dsDNA and ssDNA in the direction of the single-stranded forms. These proteins not only keep the two strands of DNA separated in the area of the replication origin, thus providing the single-stranded template required by poly-\nmerases , but also protect the DNA from nucleases  that degrade \nssDNA.\n 2. Solving the problem of supercoils:  As the two strands of the \ndouble helix are separated, a problem is encountered, namely, the appearance of positive supercoils in the region of DNA ahead of the replication fork as a result of overwinding (\nFig. 35.11 ) and negative \nsupercoils in the region behind the fork. The accumulating posi-tive supercoils interfere with further unwinding of the double helix. [Note: Supercoiling can be demonstrated by tightly grasping one end of a helical telephone cord while twisting the other end. If the cord is twisted in the direction of tightening the coils, the cord will wrap around itself in space to form positive supercoils. If the cord is twisted in the direction of loosening the coils, the cord will wrap around itself in the opposite direction to form negative supercoils.] To solve this problem, there is a group of enzymes called DNA \ntopoisomerases , which are responsible for removing supercoils in \nthe helix by transiently cleaving one or both of the DNA strands.\n a. Type I DNA topoisomerases:  These enzymes reversibly cleave \none strand of the double helix. They have both strand-cutting and strand-resealing activities. They do not require ATP , but rather appear to store the energy from the phosphodiester bond they cleave, reusing the energy to reseal the strand (\nFig. 35.12 ).

Type I topoi-\nsomerases  relax negative supercoils (that is, those that contain \nfewer turns of the helix than does relaxed DNA) in E. coli and both negative and positive supercoils (that is, those that contain fewer or more turns of the helix than does relaxed DNA) in many prokaryotic cells (but not E. coli) and in eukaryotic cells.\n b. Type II DNA topoisomerases:  These enzymes bind tightly \nto the DNA double helix and make transient breaks in both strands. The enzyme then causes a second stretch of the DNA double helix to pass through the break and, finally, reseals the break (\nFig. 35.13 ). As a result, both negative and positive \nsupercoils can be relieved by this ATP-requiring process. DNA \ngyrase , a type II topoisomerase  found in bacteria and plants, \nhas the unusual property of being able to introduce negative supercoils into circular DNA using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP .

This feat is accomplished by a slightly different mech-\nanism on each strand.\n 1. Leading strand:  The strand that is being copied in the direction of \nthe advancing replication fork is synthesized continuously and is called the leading strand.\n 2. Lagging strand:  The strand that is being copied in the direction \naway from the replication fork is synthesized discontinuously, with small fragments of DNA being copied near the replication fork. These short stretches of discontinuous DNA, termed Okazaki frag-ments, are eventually joined (ligated) by ligase  to become a single, \ncontinuous strand. The new strand of DNA produced by this mech-anism is termed the lagging strand.\nD. RNA primer\nDNA pols  cannot initiate synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA \non a totally single-stranded template. Rather, they require an RNA primer, which is a short piece of RNA base-paired to the DNA template, thereby forming a double-stranded DNA\u2013RNA hybrid. The free hydroxyl group on the 3 \u2032-end of the RNA primer serves as the first acceptor of a \ndeoxynucleotide by action of a DNA pol  (\nFig. 35.15 ). [Note: Recall that \nglycogen synthase  also requires a primer (see p. 227).]\n 1. Primase:  A specific RNA polymerase , called primase  (DnaG ), \nsynthesizes the short stretches of RNA (~10 nucleotides long) that are complementary and antiparallel to the DNA template. In the resulting hybrid duplex, the U (uracil) in RNA pairs with A in DNA. As shown in \nFigure 35.16 , these short RNA sequences are \nconstantly being synthesized at the replication fork on the lagging strand, but only one RNA sequence at the origin of replication is required on the leading strand. The substrates for this process are 5\u2032-ribonucleoside triphosphates, and pyrophosphate is released as \neach ribonucleoside monophosphate is added through formation of a 3 \u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bond. [Note: The RNA primer is later \nremoved, as described in F . below.]\n 2. Primosome:  The addition of primase  converts the prepriming \ncomplex of proteins required for DNA strand separation (see p. 595) to a primosome. The primosome makes the RNA primer required for leading-strand synthesis and initiates Okazaki fragment formation in discontinuous lagging-strand synthesis. As with DNA synthesis, the direction of synthesis of the primer is 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032.\nE. Chain elongation\nProkaryotic (and eukaryotic) DNA pols  elongate a new DNA strand \nby adding deoxyribonucleotides, one at a time, to the 3 \u2032-end of the \ngrowing chain (see Fig. 35.16 ).

DNA Structure, Replication, and Repair\nthe RNA primer as the acceptor of the first deoxyribonucleotide, \nDNA pol III  begins to add nucleotides along the single-stranded \ntemplate that specifies the sequence of bases in the newly synthe-sized chain. DNA pol III  is a highly processive enzyme (that is, it \nremains bound to the template strand as it moves along and does not diffuse away and then rebind before adding each new nucleo-tide). The processivity of DNA pol III  is the result of the \u03b2 subunits \nof the holoenzyme forming a ring that encircles and moves along the template strand of the DNA, thus serving as a sliding DNA clamp. [Note: Clamp formation is facilitated by a protein complex, the clamp loader, and ATP hydrolysis.] The new (daughter) strand grows in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 direction, antiparallel to the parental strand (see \nFig. 35.16 ). The nucleotide substrates are 5 \u2032-deoxyribonucleoside \ntriphosphates. Pyrophosphate (PP i) is released when each new \ndeoxynucleoside monophosphate is added to the free 3 \u2032-hydroxyl \ngroup of the growing chain through a 3 \u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bond \n(see Fig. 35.15 ). Hydrolysis of PP i to 2 P i by pyrophosphatase  means \nthat a total of two high-energy bonds are used to drive the addition of each deoxynucleotide.\nThe production of PP i with subsequent hydrolysis to 2 P i is a \ncommon theme in biochemistry. Removal of the PP i product \ndrives a reaction in the forward direction, making it essen-tially irreversible.\n \nAll four substrates (deoxyadenosine triphosphate [dATP], deoxythy-\nmidine triphosphate [dTTP], deoxycytidine triphosphate [dCTP], and deoxyguanosine triphosphate [dGTP]) must be present for DNA elongation to occur. If one of the four is in short supply, DNA synthesis stops when that nucleotide is depleted.\n 2. Proofreading newly synthesized DNA:  It is highly important for \nthe survival of an organism that the nucleotide sequence of DNA be replicated with as few errors as possible. Misreading of the template sequence could result in deleterious, perhaps lethal, mutations. To insure replication fidelity, DNA pol III  has a proofreading activity \n(3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease , \nFig. 35.17 ) in addition to its 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 polymerase  \nactivity. As each nucleotide is added to the chain, DNA pol III  checks \nto make certain the base of the newly added nucleotide is, in fact, the complement of the base on the template strand. If it is not, the 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease  activity removes the error in the direction \nopposite to polymerization.

The \njoining of these two stretches of DNA requires energy, which in most organisms is provided by the cleavage of ATP to adenosine monophos-phate + PP\ni.\nH. Termination\nReplication termination in E. coli is mediated by sequence-specific binding of the protein Tus (terminus utilization substance) to replication termination (ter) sites on the DNA, stopping the movement of the repli-cation fork.\nIV. EUKARYOTIC DNA REPLICATION\nThe process of eukaryotic DNA replication closely follows that of prokary-otic DNA synthesis. Some differences, such as the multiple origins of repli-cation in eukaryotic cells versus single origins of replication in prokaryotes, have already been noted. Eukaryotic origin recognition proteins, ssDNA-binding proteins, and ATP-dependent DNA helicases  have been identified, \nand their functions are analogous to those of the prokaryotic proteins previ-ously discussed. In contrast, RNA primers are removed by RNase H  and \nflap endonuclease 1  (FEN1 ) rather than by a DNA pol  (\nFig. 35.21 ).\nA. Eukaryotic cell cycle\nThe events surrounding eukaryotic DNA replication and cell division \n(mitosis) are coordinated to produce the cell cycle ( Fig. 35.22 ). The \nperiod preceding replication is called the G 1 phase (Gap 1). DNA repli-\ncation occurs during the S (synthesis) phase. Following DNA synthesis, there is another phase (G\n2, or Gap 2) before mitosis (M). Cells that have \nstopped dividing, such as mature T lymphocytes, are said to have gone out of the cell cycle into the G\n0 phase. Such quiescent cells can be \nstimulated to reenter the G 1 phase to resume division. [Note: The cell \ncycle is controlled at a series of checkpoints that prevent entry into the next phase of the cycle until the preceding phase has been completed. Two key classes of proteins that control the progress of a cell through the cell cycle are the cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases  (Cdk).]\nB.

One subunit has primase  \nactivity, which initiates strand synthesis on the leading strand and at the beginning of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. The primase  subunit synthesizes a short RNA primer that is extended by \nthe 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 polymerase  activity of pol \u03b1, generating a short piece of \nDNA.

[Note: DNA pol \u03b5 associates with \nproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein that serves as a sliding DNA clamp in much the same way the \u03b2 subunits of DNA \npol III  do in E. coli, thus insuring high processivity.]\n 3. Pol \ud835\udec3 and pol \u03b3: Pol \u03b2 is involved in gap filling in DNA repair. Pol \u03b3 \nreplicates mitochondrial DNA.\nC. Telomeres\nTelomeres are complexes of DNA plus proteins (collectively known as shelterin) located at the ends of linear chromosomes. They maintain the structural integrity of the chromosome, preventing attack by nucle-\nases, and allow repair systems to distinguish a true end from a break in \ndsDNA. In humans, telomeric DNA consists of several thousand tandem repeats of a noncoding hexameric sequence, AGGGTT, base-paired to a complementary region containing C and A. The G-rich strand is longer than its C-rich complement, leaving ssDNA a few hundred nucle-otides in length at the 3 \u2032-end. The single-stranded region is thought to \nfold back on itself, forming a loop structure that is stabilized by protein.\n 1. Telomere shortening:  Eukaryotic cells face a special problem in \nreplicating the ends of their linear DNA molecules. Following removal of the RNA primer from the extreme 5 \u2032-end of the lagging strand, \nthere is no way to fill in the remaining gap with DNA. Consequently, in most normal human somatic cells, telomeres shorten with each successive cell division. Once telomeres are shortened beyond some critical length, the cell is no longer able to divide and is said to be senescent. In germ cells and stem cells, as well as in cancer cells, telomeres do not shorten and the cells do not senesce. This is a result of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase , which maintains telo-\nmeric length in these cells.\n 2. Telomerase:  This complex contains a protein (Tert) that acts as a \nreverse transcriptase  and a short piece of RNA (Terc) that acts as \na template. The C-rich RNA template base-pairs with the G-rich, single-stranded 3 \u2032-end of telomeric DNA (\nFig. 35.24 ). The reverse \ntranscriptase  uses the RNA template to synthesize DNA in the usual \n5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction, extending the already longer 3 \u2032-end. Telomerase  \nthen translocates to the newly synthesized end, and the process is repeated. Once the G-rich strand has been lengthened, primase  \nactivity of DNA pol \u03b1 can use it as a template to synthesize an RNA \nprimer.

Eukaryotic DNA Organization 603\nTelomeres may be viewed as mitotic clocks in that their length \nin most cells is inversely related to the number of times the cells have divided. The study of telomeres provides insight into the biology of normal aging, diseases of premature aging (the progerias), and cancer.\nD. Reverse transcriptases\nAs seen with telomerase, reverse transcriptases  are RNA-directed DNA \npols. A reverse transcriptase  is involved in the replication of retrovi-\nruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These viruses carry their genome in the form of ssRNA molecules. Following infec-tion of a host cell, the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase  uses the viral \nRNA as a template for the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 synthesis of viral DNA, which then \nbecomes integrated into host chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase  \nactivity is also seen with transposons, DNA elements that can move about the genome (see p. 668). In eukaryotes, most transposons are transcribed to RNA, the RNA is used as a template for DNA synthesis by a reverse transcriptase  encoded by the transposon, and the DNA is \nrandomly inserted into the genome. [Note: Transposons that involve an RNA intermediate are called retrotransposons or retroposons.]\nE. DNA replication inhibition by nucleoside analogs\nDNA chain growth can be blocked by the incorporation of certain nucle-oside analogs that have been modified on the sugar portion (\nFig. 35.25 ). \nFor example, removal of the hydroxyl group from the 3 \u2032-carbon of the \ndeoxyribose ring as in 2 \u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyinosine ([ddI] also known as didan-\nosine), or conversion of the deoxyribose to another sugar, such as arab-inose, prevents further chain elongation. By blocking DNA replication, these compounds slow the division of rapidly growing cells and viruses. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine, or araC) has been used in anticancer chemotherapy, whereas adenine arabinoside (vidarabine, or araA) is an antiviral agent. Substitution on the sugar moiety, as seen in azidothy-midine (AZT), also called zidovudine (ZDV), also terminates DNA chain elongation. [Note: These drugs are generally supplied as nucleosides, which are then converted to nucleotides by cellular kinases .]\nV. EUKARYOTIC DNA ORGANIZATION\nA typical (diploid) human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes, whose \ntotal DNA is ~2 m long! It is difficult to imagine how such a large amount of genetic material can be effectively packaged into a volume the size of a cell nucleus so that it can be efficiently replicated and its genetic information expressed. To do so requires the interaction of DNA with a large number of proteins, each of which performs a specific function in the ordered pack-aging of these long molecules of DNA. Eukaryotic DNA is associated with tightly bound basic proteins, called histones. These serve to order the DNA into fundamental structural units, called nucleosomes, which resemble beads on a string. Nucleosomes are further arranged into increasingly more complex structures that organize and condense the long DNA molecules into chromosomes that can be segregated during cell division.

            "Text": "604 35. DNA Structure, Replication, and Repair\nA. Histones and nucleosome formation\nThere are five classes of histones, designated H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and \nH4. These small, evolutionally conserved proteins are positively charged at physiologic pH as a result of their high content of lysine and arginine. Because of their positive charge, they form ionic bonds with negatively charged DNA. Histones, along with ions such as Mg\n2+, help neutralize \nthe negatively charged DNA phosphate groups.\n 1. Nucleosomes:  Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form \nthe octameric core of the individual nucleosome \u201cbeads.\u201d Around this structural core, a segment of dsDNA is wound nearly twice (\nFig. 35.26 ). Winding eliminates a helical turn, causing negative \nsupercoiling. [Note: The N-terminal ends of these histones can be acetylated, methylated, or phosphorylated. These reversible cova-lent modifications influence how tightly the histones bind to the DNA, thereby affecting the expression of specific genes. Histone modifi-cation is an example of epigenetics, or heritable changes in gene expression caused without alteration of the nucleotide sequence.] Neighboring nucleosomes are joined by linker DNA ~50 bp long. H1 is not found in the nucleosome core, but instead binds to the linker DNA chain between the nucleosome beads. H1 is the most tissue specific and species specific of the histones. It facilitates the packing of nucleosomes into more compact structures.\n 2. Higher levels of organization:  Nucleosomes can be packed more \ntightly (stacked) to form a nucleofilament. This structure assumes the shape of a coil, often referred to as a 30-nm fiber. The fiber is organized into loops that are anchored by a nuclear scaffold containing several proteins. Additional levels of organization lead to the final chromosomal structure (\nFig. 35.27 ).\nB. Nucleosome fate during DNA replication\nParental nucleosomes are disassembled to allow access to DNA during replication. Once DNA is synthesized, nucleosomes form rapidly. Their histone proteins come both from de novo synthesis and from the transfer of parental histones.\nVI. DNA REPAIR\nDespite the elaborate proofreading system employed during DNA synthesis, errors (including incorrect base-pairing or insertion of one to a few extra nucleotides) can occur. In addition, DNA is constantly being subjected to environmental insults that cause the alteration or removal of nucleo-tide bases. The damaging agents can be either chemicals (for example, nitrous acid, which can deaminate bases) or radiation (for example, nonion-izing ultraviolet [UV] radiation, which can fuse two pyrimidines adjacent to each other in the DNA, and high-energy ionizing radiation, which can cause double-strand breaks). Bases are also altered or lost spontaneously from mammalian DNA at a rate of many thousands per cell per day. If the damage is not repaired, a permanent change (mutation) is introduced that can result in any of a number of deleterious effects, including loss of control over the proliferation of the mutated cell, leading to cancer. Luckily, cells are remarkably efficient at repairing damage done to their DNA.

These excision repair systems remove one to tens of nucleotides. [Note: Repair synthesis of DNA can occur outside of the S phase.]\nA. Mismatch repair\nSometimes replication errors escape the proofreading activity during DNA synthesis, causing a mismatch of one to several bases. In E.  coli, \nmismatch repair (MMR) is mediated by a group of proteins known as the Mut proteins (\nFig. 35.28 ). Homologous proteins are present in humans. \n[Note: MMR occurs within minutes of replication and reduces the error rate of replication from 1 in 10\n7 to 1 in 109 nucleotides.]\n 1. Mismatched strand identification:  When a mismatch occurs, the \nMut proteins that identify the mispaired nucleotide(s) must be able to discriminate between the correct strand and the strand with the mismatch. In prokaryotes, discrimination is based on the degree of methylation (see \nFig. 35.32 ). GATC sequences, which are found \nonce every thousand nucleotides, are methylated on the adenine (A) residue by DNA adenine methylase  (DAM ). This methylation is not \ndone immediately after synthesis, so the DNA is hemimethylated (that is, the parental strand is methylated, but the daughter strand is not). The methylated parental strand is assumed to be correct, and it is the daughter strand that gets repaired. [Note: The exact mech-anism by which the daughter strand is identified in eukaryotes is not yet known, but likely involves recognition of nicks in the newly synthesized strand.]\n2Nucleosome \"beads\"\n(histones plus DNA)\n3Nucleofilament\n(30-nm fiber)\n1Naked DNA\n(all histones removed)Nuclear scaffold protein\nDNA H1Nucleosome core\np\n4Nucleofilament coiled and \nanchored to scaffold protein\n5Mitotic chromosome\n(highly condensed chromatin)\nFigure 35.27\nStructural organization of eukaryotic DNA.

Repair procedure:  When the strand containing the mismatch is \nidentified, an endonuclease  nicks the strand, and the mismatched \nnucleotide(s) is/are removed by an exonuclease . Additional nucleo-\ntides at the 5 \u2032- and 3 \u2032-ends of the mismatch are also removed. The \ngap left by removal of the nucleotides is filled, using the sister strand as a template, by a DNA pol , typically DNA pol III . The 3 \u2032-hydroxyl \nof the newly synthesized DNA is joined to the 5 \u2032-phosphate of the \nremaining stretch of the original DNA strand by DNA ligase .\nMutation to the proteins involved in MMR in humans is \nassociated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. Although HNPCC confers an increased risk for developing colon cancer (as well as other cancers), only about 5% of all colon cancer is the result of mutations in MMR.\nB. Nucleotide excision repair\nExposure of a cell to UV radiation can result in the covalent joining of \ntwo adjacent pyrimidines (usually thymines), producing a dimer. These intrastrand cross-links prevent DNA pol  from replicating the DNA strand \nbeyond the site of dimer formation. Thymine dimers are excised in bacteria by UvrABC proteins in a process known as nucleotide exci-sion repair (NER), as illustrated in \nFigure 35.29 . A related pathway is \npresent in humans (see 2. below). [Note: Transcription-coupled repair, a type of NER, fixes DNA lesions encountered during RNA synthesis.]\n 1. Recognition and excision of UV-induced dimers:  A UV-specific \nendonuclease  (called UvrABC excinuclease ) recognizes the bulky \ndimer and cleaves the damaged strand on both the 5 \u2032-side and \n3\u2032-side of the lesion. A short oligonucleotide containing the dimer is \nexcised, leaving a gap in the DNA strand. This gap is filled in using a DNA pol I  and DNA ligase . NER occurs throughout the cell cycle.\n 2. UV radiation and cancer:  Pyrimidine dimers can be formed in the \nskin cells of humans exposed to UV radiation in unfiltered sunlight (see \nFig. 35.32 ). In the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmen-\ntosum (XP), the cells cannot repair the damaged DNA, resulting in extensive accumulation of mutations and, consequently, early and numerous skin cancers (\nFig. 35.30 ). XP can be caused by defects in \nany of the several genes that code for the XP proteins required for NER of UV damage in humans.\nC. Base excision repair\nDNA bases can be altered, either spontaneously, as is the case with cytosine, which slowly undergoes deamination (the loss of its amino group) to form uracil, or by the action of deaminating or alkylating compounds. For example, nitrous acid, which is formed by the cell from precursors such as the nitrates, deaminates cytosine, adenine (to hypoxanthine), and guanine (to xanthine). Dimethyl sulfate can alkylate (methylate) adenine. Bases can also be lost spontaneously. For example, ~10,000 purine bases are lost this way per cell per day. Lesions involving base alterations or loss can be corrected by base excision repair ([BER], \nFig. 35.31 ).3\u02b9\n5\u02b9 3\u02b95\u02b9\nTDaughter \nstrand\nParent strand with\nmethylated adenine\nDNA polymerase III\nDNA ligaseG                     \nG                     GATC GATC\n3\u02b9\n5\u02b9 3\u02b95\u02b9\nTGATC GATC\n3\u02b9\n5\u02b9 3\u02b95\u02b9\nGATC GATCCH3 CH3\nCH3 CH3\nCH3 CH3 The newly replicated daughter \nstrand (green) contains a G mismatched to T in the parent strand (blue). \nGT are not \nhydrogen bonded.\nMut proteins recognize the \nmismatch, identify the methylated (parental) strand, and cleave the daughter strand.1\n2\n3Segment of daughter strand isreleased.\nPolymerase  fills the gap, and \nligase  joins the newly synthesized \nDNA piece to the original DNA strand.\nA\nTDeoxynucleotides\nFigure 35.28\nMethyl-directed mismatch repair \nin Escherichia coli.

This leaves an apyrimidinic site, or apurinic if a purine was removed, both referred to as AP sites.\n 2. AP site recognition and repair:  Specific AP endonucleases  recog-\nnize that a base is missing and initiate the process of excision and gap filling by making an endonucleolytic cut just to the 5 \u2032-side of the \nAP site. A deoxyribose  phosphate lyase  removes the single, base-\nfree, sugar phosphate residue. DNA pol I  and DNA ligase  complete \nthe repair process.\nD. Double-strand break repair\nIonizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, and oxidative free radicals (see p. 253) can cause double-strand breaks in DNA that can be lethal to the cell. [Note: Such breaks also occur natu-rally during genetic recombination.] dsDNA breaks cannot be corrected by the previously described strategy of excising the damage on one strand and using the undamaged strand as a template for replacing the missing nucleotide(s). Instead, they are repaired by one of two systems. The first is nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in which a group of proteins (Ku and DNA-dependent protein kinases ) mediates the recog-\nnition, processing, and ligation of the ends of two DNA fragments. However, some DNA is lost in the process. Consequently, NHEJ is error prone and mutagenic. Defects in NHEJ are associated with a predis-position to cancer and immunodeficiency syndromes. The second repair system, homologous recombination (HR), uses the enzymes that normally perform genetic recombination between homologous chromo-somes during meiosis. This system is much less error prone (\u201cerror-free\u201d) than NHEJ because any DNA that was lost is replaced using homologous DNA as a template. HR occurs in late S and G\n2 of the cell \ncycle, whereas NHEJ can occur anytime ( Fig. 35.32 ). [Note: Mutations \nto the proteins BRCA1 or BRCA2 (breast cancer 1 or 2), which are involved in HR, increase the risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer.]Mechanism Error Repaired by\nMismatch \nrepairError in copying 1-5 bases Methylated DNA identified, \ndigestion by exonucleases \nand replacement\nNucleotide \nexcision repairDamage to a segment \nof DNA because of UV radiation, chemicals, etc.Approx. 30 bp nucleotide \nremoved by UvrABC exci-\nnuclease and then replaced\nBase \nexcision repairSingle base damage \nbecause of radiation, chemicals, etc.Base excision by DNA-gly-\ncosylase , recognition by AP \nendonucleases and repair\nDouble \nstrands breakBoth strands of DNA break \ndue to ionizing radiations, chemotherapy, oxidative-free radicals, etc.Approximation, unwinding, li-\ngation by NHEJ or homolo-gous recombination\nFigure 35.32\nSalient features of DNA repair mechanisms.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   608 24-10-2020   12:12:57"

Medical Perspectives\nBased on the knowledge gained in this chapter, the following medical \nperspectives must be understood.\nMedications\n\u2022 Antibiotics: DNA gyrase is a bacterial topoisomerase which acts on \nclosed circular DNA of bacteria. Therefore, when drugs are given specif-ically against bacterial DNA gyrase it does not harm the human DNA \nenzymes. Some examples are the common antibiotics ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid.\n\u2022 Anti-cancer agents: Anti-cancer drugs, when acting against eukaryotic \nhuman DNA, cannot differentiate between normal and abnormal cells. Therefore, chemotherapeutic drugs have many side effects.\nEtoposide and Adriamycin both inhibit human topoisomerase and are used \nas anti-cancer drugs. 5-mercaptopurine inhibits human DNA polymerase \nand 5-fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase . Anti-cancer agents, such \nas the camptothecins, target human type I topoisomerases , whereas \netoposide targets human type II topoisomerases .\nRare Diseases\nDiseases associated with DNA repair mechanisms are rare but may be \nencountered in clinical practice.\n\u2022 Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer is a defect in mismatch repair \nof hMSH 1 and 2 genes. This cancer accounts for only 5% of all colon cancers\n\u2022 Xeroderma pigmentosum is the increased sensitivity to sunlight and \nhyperpigmentation, and it occurs due to defective nucleotide excision repair. Though its prevalence is only one in a million, it is strongly asso-ciated with skin cancers.\n\u2022 Double strand break repair happens in genetic recombination of immu-\nnoglobulins normally. However, abnormal double strand breaks happen due to chemotherapeutic drugs like doxorubicin and ionizing radiation, etc.\n\u2022 Fanconi anemia is a very rare genetic condition with defect in DNA \ncross-link repair mechanisms. This leads to cancers and ultimately to bone marrow failure.\n\u2022 Ataxia telangiectasia is due to a defective ATM gene which plays a role \nin regulating cell division in DNA damage.

Chapter Summary\nDNA is a polymer of deoxynucleoside monophosphates covalently linked by 3\u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bonds  (Fig. 35.33 ). \nThe resulting long, unbranched chain has polarity , with both a 5 \u2032-end (free phosphate) and a 3 \u2032-end (free hydroxyl). The \nsequence of nucleotides is read 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032. DNA exists as a double-stranded  molecule, in which the two chains are paired in \nan antiparallel  manner and wind around each other, forming a double helix . Adenine  pairs with thymine , and cytosine  \npairs with guanine . Each strand of the double helix serves as a template  for constructing a complementary  daughter \nstrand ( semiconservative replication ). DNA replication occurs in the S phase  of the cell cycle  and begins at an origin \nof replication . As the two strands unwind and separate, synthesis occurs at two replication forks  that move away from \nthe origin in opposite directions (bidirectionally). Helicase  unwinds the double helix. As the two strands of the double helix \nare separated, positive supercoils  are produced in the region of DNA ahead of the replication fork and negative super-\ncoils behind the fork. DNA topoisomerases  types I  and II remove supercoils. DNA polymerases  (pols) synthesize new \nDNA strands only in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction. Therefore, one of the newly synthesized stretches of nucleotide chains must \ngrow in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 direction toward the replication fork ( leading strand ) and one in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 direction away from the \nreplication fork ( lagging strand ). DNA pols  require a primer , a short stretch of RNA synthesized by primase . Leading-\nstrand synthesis needs only one RNA primer ( continuous  synthesis), whereas the lagging strand needs many ( discon-\ntinuous  synthesis involving Okazaki fragments ). In Escherichia  coli (E.  coli), DNA chain elongation is catalyzed by DNA \npol III , using 5\u2032-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates  as substrates. The enzyme proofreads  the newly synthesized DNA, \nremoving terminal mismatched nucleotides with its 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease  activity. RNA primers are removed by DNA pol I , \nusing its 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease  activity. This enzyme fills the gaps with DNA, proofreading as it synthesizes. The final phos-\nphodiester linkage is catalyzed by DNA ligase . There are at least five high-fidelity eukaryotic DNA pols . Pol \u03b1 is a multi-\nsubunit enzyme, one subunit of which is a primase . Pol \u03b1 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 polymerase  activity adds a short piece of DNA to the \nRNA primer. Pol \u03b5 completes DNA synthesis on the leading strand, whereas pol \u03b4 elongates each lagging strand fragment. \nPol \u03b2 is involved with DNA repair, and pol \u03b3 replicates mitochondrial DNA. Pols \u03b5, \u03b4, and \u03b3 use 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease  activity \nto proofread. Nucleoside analogs  containing modified sugars can be used to block DNA chain growth. They are useful \nin anticancer and antiviral chemotherapy. Telomeres  are stretches of highly repetitive DNA  complexed with protein that \nprotect the ends  of linear chromosomes. As most cells divide and age, these sequences are shortened, contributing to \nsenescence. In cells that do not senesce (for example, germline and cancer cells), the ribonucleoprotein telomerase  \nemploys its protein component reverse transcriptase  to extend the telomeres, using its RNA  component as a template . \nThere are five classes of positively charged histone  (H) proteins . Two of each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form an \noctameric structural core around which DNA is wrapped, creating a nucleosome . The DNA connecting the nucleosomes, \ncalled linker DNA , is bound to H1. Nucleosomes can be packed more tightly to form a nucleofilament. Additional levels \nof organization create a chromosome. Most DNA damage can be corrected by excision repair  involving recognition and \nremoval of the damage by repair proteins, followed by replacement by DNA pols  and joining by ligase . Ultraviolet radia-\ntion can cause thymine dimers  that are recognized and removed in E.  coli by uvrABC proteins of nucleotide excision \nrepair . Defects in the XP proteins  needed for nucleotide excision repair of thymine dimers in humans result in xero-\nderma pigmentosum . Mismatched  bases are repaired by a similar process of recognition and removal by Mut proteins  \nin E. coli. The extent of methylation  is used for strand identification in prokaryotes. Defective mismatch repair by homolo-\ngous proteins in humans is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer . Abnormal bases (such as uracil) \nare removed by DNA N-glycosylases  in base excision repair , and the sugar phosphate at the apyrimidinic or apurinic \nsite is cut out. Double-strand breaks in DNA are repaired by nonhomologous end joining  (error prone) and template-\nrequiring homologous recombination  (\u201cerror-free\u201d).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   610 24-10-2020   12:12:57"

Telomerase contains an RNA that serves as the template, not the primer, for the synthesis of telomeric DNA by the reverse transcriptase of telomerase. Telomeric RNA has no cata-lytic activity. As a reverse transcriptase, telomerase synthesizes DNA using its RNA template and so is an RNA-directed DNA polymerase. The direction of synthesis, \nas with all DNA synthesis, is 5 \u2032\n\u21923\u2032, and it is the 3 \u2032-end of \nthe already longer 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 strand that gets extended.35.2.

However, it is through ribonucleic acid (RNA), the \u201cworking copies\u201d of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), that the master plan is expressed (\nFig. 36.1 ). The copying process, during which \na DNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of RNA, is called transcription.  Transcription produces messenger RNA (mRNA), which are \ntranslated into sequences of amino acids (proteins), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and additional RNA molecules that perform specialized structural, catalytic, and regulatory functions and are not trans-lated. That is, they are noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Therefore, the final product of gene expression can be RNA or protein, depending upon the gene. [Note: Only ~2% of the genome encodes proteins.] A central feature of transcription is that it is highly selective. For example, many transcripts are made of some regions of the DNA. In other regions, few or no transcripts are made. This selectivity is due, at least in part, to signals embedded in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA. These signals instruct the RNA poly-\nmerase  where to start, how often to start, and where to stop transcription. \nSeveral regulatory proteins are also involved in this selection process. The biochemical differentiation of an organism\u2019s tissues is ultimately a result of the selectivity of the transcription process. [Note: This selectivity of tran-scription is in contrast to the \u201call-or-none\u201d nature of genomic replication.] Another important feature of transcription is that many RNA transcripts that initially are faithful copies of one of the two DNA strands may undergo various modifications, such as terminal additions, base modifications, trim-ming, and internal segment removal, which convert the inactive primary transcript into a functional molecule. The transcriptome is the complete set of RNA transcripts expressed by a genome.Learning Objectives \nAt the end of this chapter, the student will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the structure and function of RNA\n\u2022 Describe the process of transcription\u2022 Explain expression of a gene in prokaryotes and eukaryotes\nFigure 36.1\nExpression of genetic information by \ntranscription.

RNA STRUCTURE\nThere are three major types of RNA that participate in the process of protein \nsynthesis: rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Like DNA, these RNA are unbranched polymeric molecules composed of nucleoside monophosphates joined together by 3 \u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bonds (see p. 575). However, they differ \nfrom DNA in several ways. For example, they are considerably smaller than DNA, contain ribose instead of deoxyribose and uracil instead of thymine, and exist as single strands that are capable of folding into complex struc-tures. The three major types of RNA also differ from each other in size, function, and special structural modifications. Non coding RNA is a RNA \nmolecule that is not translating to a protein. They therefore include ribosomal RNA, tRNA and many small RNA like miRNA . [Note: In eukary-\notes, additional small ncRNA molecules found in the nucleolus (snoRNA), nucleus (snRNA), and cytoplasm (microRNA [miRNA]) perform specialized functions as described on p. 617]\nA. Ribosomal RNA\nrRNA are found in association with several proteins as components of the ribosomes, the complex structures that serve as the sites for protein synthesis (see p. 639). Prokaryotic cells contain three distinct size species of rRNA (23S, 16S, and 5S, where S is the Svedberg unit for sedimentation rate that is determined by the size and shape of the particle), as shown in \nFigure 36.2 . Eukaryotic cells contain four rRNA \nspecies (28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S). Together, rRNA make up ~80% of the total RNA in the cell.  \nCatalytic RNA molecules are known as ribozymes. For example, RNA \nlike snRNA possesses catalytic activity in spliceosomes. RNAase-P cuts \nthe 5 \u2032end of pre-tRNA and is also a ribozyme. Further peptidyl trans-\nferase  present in ribosomes catalyzes peptide bond formation quali-\nfying it to be a ribozyme. \nB.

The tRNA molecules contain a high percentage of unusual (modified) bases, for example, dihydrouracil (see Fig. 34.2, p. 292), and have extensive intrachain base-pairing (\nFig. 36.3 ) that leads to characteristic secondary and tertiary struc-\nture. Each tRNA serves as an adaptor molecule that carries its specific amino acid, covalently attached to its 3 \u2032-end, to the site of protein \nsynthesis. There, it recognizes the genetic code se quence on an mRNA, \nwhich specifies the addition of that amino acid to the growing peptide chain (see p. 447).\nC. Messenger RNA\nmRNA comprises only ~5% of the RNA in a cell, yet is by far the most heterogeneous type of RNA in size and base sequence. mRNA is coding RNA in that it carries genetic information from DNA for use in protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, this involves transport of mRNA out of the nucleus and into the cytosol. An mRNA carrying information from more than one gene is polycistronic. Polycistronic mRNA is characteristic of \nprokaryotes. An mRNA carrying information from only one gene is mono-cistronic and is characteristic of eukaryotes. A cistron  is the smallest \nunit of genetic expression and therefore includes the gene as well as its promoter elements. In addition to the protein-coding regions that can be translated, mRNA contains untranslated regions at its 5 \u2032- and 3 \u2032-ends \n(\nFig. 36.4 ). Special structural characteristics of eukaryotic (but not \nprokaryotic) mRNA include a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (a poly-A tail) on the 3 \u2032-end of the RNA, plus a cap on the 5 \u2032-end consisting \nof a molecule of 7-methylguanosine attached through an unusual (5 \u2032\u21925\u2032) \ntriphosphate linkage. The mechanisms for modifying mRNA to create these special structural characteristics are discussed on pp. 624\u2013625.\nRNA editing  is the term given to changes in RNA after its formation. \nFor example, a 100 kDa protein (ApoB100) is made in liver from ApoB gene. But in the intestine, though the same primary transcript is formed, a cytidine deaminase converts a CAA codon in the mRNA into a UAA \ncodon. This causes a change from the glutamine codon to a termina-tion codon. Now the protein formed in intestine has a premature termi-nation of chain and is ApoB48. \nFigure 36.3\nA.

PROKARYOTIC GENE TRANSCRIPTION\nThe structure of magnesium-requiring RNA polymerase  (RNA pol ), the \nsignals that control transcription, and the varieties of modification that RNA transcripts can undergo differ among organisms, particularly from prokary-otes to eukaryotes. Therefore, the discussions of prokaryotic and eukary-otic transcription are presented separately.\nA. Prokaryotic RNA polymerase\nIn bacteria, one species of RNA pol  synthesizes all of the RNA except for \nthe short RNA primers needed for DNA replication [Note: RNA primers are synthesized by the specialized, monomeric enzyme primase  (see \np. 597).] RNA pol  is a multisubunit enzyme that recognizes a nucleo-\ntide sequence (the promoter region) at the beginning of a length of DNA that is to be transcribed. It next makes a complementary RNA copy of the DNA template strand and then recognizes the end of the DNA sequence to be transcribed (the termination region). RNA is synthesized from its 5 \u2032-end to its 3 \u2032-end, antiparallel to its DNA template strand \n(see Fig. 36.5). The template is copied as it is in DNA synthesis, in which a guanine (G) on the DNA specifies a cytosine (C) in the RNA, a C specifies a G, a thymine (T) specifies an adenine (A), but an A spec-ifies a uracil (U) instead of a T (\nFig. 36.5 ). The RNA, then, is comple-\nmentary to the DNA template (antisense, minus) strand and identical to the coding (sense, plus) strand, with U replacing T. Within the DNA molecule, regions of both strands can serve as templates for transcrip-tion. For a given gene, however, only one of the two DNA strands can be the template. Which strand is used is determined by the location of the promoter for that gene. Transcription by RNA pol  involves a core \nenzyme and several auxiliary proteins.\n 1. Core enzyme:  Five of the enzyme\u2019s peptide subunits, 2 \u03b1, 1 \u03b2, 1 \u03b2\u2032, \nand 1 \u03a9, are required for enzyme assembly ( \u03b1, \u03a9), template binding \n(\u03b2\u2032), and the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 polymerase  activity ( \u03b2) and together are referred \nto as the core enzyme (\nFig. 36.6 ). However, this enzyme lacks spec-\nificity (that is, it cannot recognize the promoter region on the DNA template).\n 2. Holoenzyme:  The \u03c3 subunit (sigma factor) enables RNA pol  to \nrecognize promoter regions on the DNA. The \u03c3 subunit plus the core \nenzyme make up the holoenzyme. [Note: Different \u03c3 factors recog-\nnize different groups of genes, with \u03c3\n70 predominating.]\nB. Steps in RNA synthesis\nThe process of transcription of a typical gene of Escherichia  coli (E.  coli) \ncan be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termina-tion. A transcription unit extends from the promoter to the termination region, and the initial product of transcription by RNA pol  is termed the \nprimary transcript.\n 1. Initiation:  Transcription begins with the binding of the RNA pol  \nholoenzyme to a region of the DNA known as the promoter, which is not transcribed. The prokaryotic promoter contains characteristic consensus sequences (\nFig. 36.7 ). [Note: Consensus sequences are \nidealized sequences in which the base shown at each position is the Figure 36.6\nComponents of prokaryotic RNA \npolymerase .\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03a9\u03b2\u02b9Holoenzyme\nCore \nenzyme\u03c3Figure 36.5\nAntiparallel, complementary base pairs \nbetween DNA and RNA.

Therefore, the TTGACA sequence is centered at approximately base \u221235. The first base at the transcription start site is assigned a position of +1. There is no base designated \u201c0\u201d.]\n b. Pribnow box:  The holoenzyme moves and covers a second \nconsensus sequence (5 \u2032-TATAAT-3 \u2032), centered at about \u221210 \n(see \nFig. 36.7 ), which is the site of melting (unwinding) of a short \nstretch (~14 base pairs) of DNA. This initial melting converts the closed initiation complex to an open complex known as a tran-scription bubble. [Note: A mutation in either the \u221210 or the \u221235 sequence can affect the transcription of the gene controlled by the mutant promoter.]\n 2. Elongation:  Once the promoter has been recognized and bound \nby the holoenzyme, local unwinding of the DNA helix continues (\nFig. 36.8 ), mediated by the polymerase . [Note: Unwinding gener-\nates supercoils in the DNA that can be relieved by DNA topoisom-\nerases  (see p. 595).] RNA pol  begins to synthesize a transcript of \nthe DNA sequence, and several short pieces of RNA are made and discarded. The elongation phase begins when the transcript (typically starting with a purine) exceeds 10 nucleotides in length. Sigma is then released, and the core enzyme is able to leave (clear) the promoter and move along the template strand in a processive manner, serving as its own sliding clamp. During transcription, a short DNA\u2013RNA hybrid helix is formed (see \nFig. 36.8 ). Like DNA pol , \nRNA pol  uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrates and releases \npyrophosphate each time a nucleoside monophosphate is added to the growing chain. As with replication, transcription is always in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction. In contrast to DNA pol , RNA pol  does not require Figure 36.7 \nStructure of the prokaryotic promoter region.

[Note: Misincorporation of a ribonucleotide causes RNA pol  \nto pause, backtrack, cleave the transcript, and restart. Nonetheless, transcription has a higher error rate than does replication.]\n 3. Termination:  The elongation of the single-stranded RNA chain \ncontinues until a termination signal is reached. Termination can be intrinsic (occur without additional proteins) or dependent upon the participation of a protein known as the \u03c1 (rho) factor.\n a. \u03c1-Independent:  Seen with most prokaryotic genes, this requires \nthat a sequence in the DNA template generates a sequence in the nascent (newly made) RNA that is self-complementary (\nFig. 36.9 ). This allows the RNA to fold back on itself, forming a \nGC-rich stem (stabilized by hydrogen bonds) plus a loop. This structure is known as a \u201chairpin.\u201d Additionally, just beyond the hairpin, the RNA transcript contains a string of Us at the 3 \u2032-end. \nThe bonding of these Us to the complementary As of the DNA template is weak. This facilitates the separation of the newly synthesized RNA from its DNA template, as the double helix \u201czips up\u201d behind the RNA pol .\n b. \u03c1-Dependent:  This requires the participation of the additional \nprotein rho, which is a hexameric ATPase  with helicase  activity. \nRho binds a C-rich rho utilization (rut) site near the 5 \u2032-end of the \nnascent RNA and, using its ATPase  activity, moves along the \nRNA until it reaches the RNA pol  paused at the termination site. \nThe ATP-dependent helicase  activity of rho separates the RNA\u2013\nDNA hybrid helix, causing the release of the RNA.\n 4. Antibiotics:  Some antibiotics prevent bacterial cell growth by inhib-\niting RNA synthesis. For example, rifampin (rifampicin) inhibits tran-scription initiation by binding to the \u03b2 subunit of prokaryotic RNA pol  \nand preventing chain growth beyond three nucleotides (\nFig. 36.10 ). \nRifampin is important in the treatment of tuberculosis. Dactinomycin (actinomycin D) was the first antibiotic to find therapeutic applica-tion in tumor chemotherapy. It inserts (intercalates) between the DNA bases and inhibits transcription initiation and elongation.Figure 36.9\nRho-independent termination of \nprokaryotic transcription. A.

            "Text": "IV. Eukaryotic Gene Transcription 621\nIV. EUKARYOTIC GENE TRANSCRIPTION\nThe transcription of eukaryotic genes is a far more complicated process \nthan transcription in prokaryotes. Fidelity is the site at which transcrip-\ntion starts. This is designated as +1. The core-promoter elements (see \nFig. 36.12 ) ensure fidelity of transcription. Frequency  is the number of \ntimes this event of transcription has to occur and is dependent on the transcription factors binding to the proximal and distal regulatory elements (see \nFig. 36.12 ). Eukaryotic transcription involves separate polymerases  for \nthe synthesis of rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. In addition, a large number of proteins called transcription factors (TF) are involved. TF bind to distinct sites on the DNA within the core promoter region, close (proximal) to it, or some distance away (distal). They are required for both the assembly of a transcription initiation complex at the promoter and the determina-tion of which genes are to be transcribed. [Note: Each eukaryotic RNA pol  \nhas its own promoters and TF that bind core promoter sequences.] For TF to recognize and bind to their specific DNA sequences, the chromatin structure in that region must be decondensed (relaxed) to allow access to the DNA. The role of transcription in the regulation of gene expression is discussed in Chapter 38.\nA. Chromatin structure and gene expression\nThe association of DNA with histones to form nucleosomes (see p. 604) affects the ability of the transcription machinery to access the DNA to be transcribed. Most actively transcribed genes are found in a rela-tively decon densed form of chromatin called euchromatin, whereas most \ninactive segments of DNA are found in highly condensed heterochro-matin. The interconversion of these forms is called chromatin remodeling. A major component of chromatin remodeling is the covalent modification of histones (for example, the acetylation of lysine residues at the amino terminus of histone proteins), as shown in\n Figure 36.11 . Acetylation, medi-\nated by histone acetyltransferases  (HAT), eliminates the positive charge \non the lysine, thereby decreasing the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA. Removal of the acetyl group by histone deacety-\nlases  (HDAC ) restores the positive charge and fosters stronger interactions \nbetween histones and DNA. [Note: The ATP-dependent repositioning of nucleosomes is also required to access DNA.]\nB. Nuclear RNA polymerases\nThere are three distinct types of RNA pol  in the nucleus of eukaryotic \ncells. All are large enzymes with multiple subunits. Each type of RNA \npol recognizes particular genes. [Note: Mitochondria contain a single \nRNA pol  that resembles the bacterial enzyme.]\n 1. RNA polymerase I:  This enzyme synthesizes the precursor of the \n28S, 18S, and 5.8S rRNA in the nucleolus.\n 2. RNA polymerase II:  This enzyme synthesizes the nuclear precur-\nsors of mRNA that are processed and then translated to proteins. RNA pol II  also synthesizes certain small ncRNA, such as snoRNA, \nsnRNA, and miRNA.\n a. Promoters for RNA polymerase II:  In some genes tran-\nscribed by RNA pol II , a sequence of nucleotides (TATAAA) that \nis nearly identical to that of the Pribnow box (see p. 619) is Figure 36.10\nInhibition of prokaryotic RNA polymerase  \nby rifampin (rifampicin).\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\u02b9\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\u02b9\nRNA polymerase\nwith distorted conformationRNA polymerase  No drug present\nRifampin present\u03c3A\nB\nRifampin\nRifampin binds to RNA polymerase\nand prevents chain growthbeyond three nucleotides.Eukaryotic  RNA polymerases\ndo not bind rifampin, and transcription is unaffected.\nFigure 36.11\nAcetylation/deacetylation of a lysine \nresidue in a histone.

This core promoter consensus sequence is called the TATA, or Hogness, box. In the majority of genes, however, no TATA box is present. Instead, different core promoter elements such as Inr (initiator) or DPE (downstream promoter element) are present (\nFig. 36.12 ). [Note: No one consensus sequence \nis found in all core promoters.] Because these sequences are on the same molecule of DNA as the gene being transcribed, they are cis-acting. The sequences serve as binding sites for proteins known as general transcription factors (GTF), which in turn interact with each other and with RNA pol II .\n b. General transcription factors:  GTF are the minimal require-\nments for recognition of the promoter, recruitment of RNA pol \nII to the promoter, formation of the preinitiation complex, and \ninitiation of transcription at a basal level (\nFig. 36.13A ). GTF are \nencoded by different genes, synthesized in the cytosol, and diffuse (transit) to their sites of action, and so are trans-acting. [Note: In contrast to the prokaryotic holoenzyme, eukaryotic RNA pol II  does not itself recognize and bind the promoter. \nInstead, TFIID, a GTF containing TATA-binding protein and TATA-associated factors, recognizes and binds the TATA box (and other core promoter elements). TFIIF, another GTF, brings the polymerase  to the promoter. The helicase  activity of TFIIH \nmelts the DNA, and its kinase  activity phosphorylates poly-\nmerase , allowing it to clear the promoter.]\n c. Regulatory elements and transcriptional activators:  \nAdditional consensus sequences lie upstream of the core promoter (see \nFig. 36.12 ). Those close to the core promoter \n(within ~200 nucleotides) are the proximal regulatory elements, such as the CAAT and GC boxes. Those farther away are the distal regulatory elements such as enhancers (see d. below). Proteins known as transcriptional activators or specific tran-scription factors (STF) bind these regulatory elements. STF bind to promoter proximal elements to regulate the frequency of transcription initiation and to distal elements to mediate the response to signals such as hormones (see p. 663) and regulate which genes are expressed at a given point in time.

One is a DNA-binding domain, the other is a transcription activation domain that recruits the GTF to the core promoter as well as coactivator proteins such as the HAT enzymes involved in chromatin modi-\nfication. [Note: Mediator, a multisubunit coactivator of RNA pol \nII\u2013catalyzed transcription, binds the polymerase , the GTF, and \nthe STF and regulates transcription initiation.]\nTranscriptional activators bind DNA through a variety of \nmotifs, such as the helix-loop-helix, zinc finger, and leucine \nzipper (see pp. 656\u2013657).\n d. Role of enhancers:  Enhancers are special DNA sequences \nthat increase the rate of initiation of transcription by RNA pol II . \nEnhancers are typically on the same chromosome as the gene whose transcription they stimulate (\nFig. 36.13B ). However, they \ncan 1) be located upstream (to the 5 \u2032-side) or downstream (to \nthe 3 \u2032-side) of the transcription start site, 2) be close to or thou-\nsands of base pairs away from the promoter ( Fig. 36.14 ), and \n3) occur on either strand of the DNA. Enhancers contain DNA sequences called response elements that bind STF. By bending or looping the DNA, STF can interact with other TF bound to \na promoter and with RNA pol II , thereby stimulating transcription \n(see \nFig. 36.13B ). Mediator also binds enhancers. [Note: Although \nsilencers are similar to enhancers in that they also can act over long distances, they reduce gene expression.]\n e. RNA polymerase II inhibitor:  \u03b1-Amanitin, a potent toxin \nproduced by the poisonous mushroom Amanita phalloides (sometimes called the \u201cdeath cap\u201d), binds RNA pol II  tightly and \nslows its movement, thereby inhibiting mRNA synthesis.\n 3.

POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATION OF RNA\nA primary transcript is the initial, linear, RNA copy of a transcription unit (the segment of DNA between specific initiation and termination sequences). The primary transcripts of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNA and rRNA are posttranscriptionally modified by cleavage of the original transcripts by ribonucleases . tRNA are further modified to help give each species its \nunique identity. In contrast, prokaryotic mRNA is generally identical to its primary transcript, whereas eukaryotic mRNA is extensively modified both co- and posttranscriptionally. Further, in eukaryotes, mRNA packaging factors called TREX (transcription export)  are responsible for directing \nthe mRNA out of the nucleus into cytoplasm through nuclear pores. \nA.

[Note: In eukaryotes, rRNA genes are found in long, tandem arrays. rRNA synthesis and processing occur in the nucleolus, with base and sugar modifications facilitated by snoRNA.]\nB. Transfer RNA\nBoth eukaryotic and prokaryotic tRNA are also made from longer precursor molecules that must be modified (\nFig. 36.16 ).

Posttranscriptional Modification of RNA 625\nthe 5 \u2032-terminal end of the mRNA through an unusual 5 \u2032\u21925\u2032-triphos-\nphate linkage that is resistant to most nucleases . Creation of the \ncap requires removal of the \u03b3 phosphoryl group from the 5 \u2032-triphos-\nphate of the pre-mRNA, followed by addition of guanosine mono-phosphate (from guanosine triphosphate) by the nuclear enzyme guanylyltransferase . Methylation of this terminal guanine occurs \nin the cytosol and is catalyzed by guanine-7-methyltransferase . \nS-Adenosylmethionine is the source of the methyl group (see p. 263). Additional methylation steps may occur. The addition of this 7-methylguanosine cap helps stabilize the mRNA and permits efficient initiation of translation (see p. 399).\n 2. Addition of a 3 \u2032-poly-A tail:  Most eukaryotic mRNA (with several \nexceptions, including those for the histones) have a chain of 40\u2013250 adenylates (adenosine monophosphates) attached to the 3 \u2032-end \n(see \nFig. 36.17 ). This poly-A tail is not transcribed from the DNA but \nrather is added by the nuclear enzyme, polyadenylate polymerase , \nusing ATP as the substrate. The pre-mRNA is cleaved down-stream of a consensus sequence, called the polyadenylation signal sequence (AAUAAA), found near the 3 \u2032-end of the RNA, and the \npoly-A tail is added to the new 3 \u2032-end. Tailing terminates eukary-\notic transcription. Tails help stabilize the mRNA, facilitate its exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After the mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened.\n 3. Splicing:  Maturation of eukaryotic mRNA usually involves removal \nfrom the primary transcript of RNA sequences (introns or inter-vening sequences) that do not code for protein. The remaining coding (expressed) sequences, the exons, are joined together to form the mature mRNA. The process of removing introns and joining exons is called splicing. The molecular complex that accomplishes these tasks is known as the spliceosome. Spliceosome  consists of \nprimary transcript plus snRNA like U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 and approx-imately 60 other proteins.

They facilitate the removal of introns by forming base pairs with the consensus sequences at each end of the intron (\nFig. 36.18 ). [Note: In systemic lupus erythe-\nmatosus, an autoimmune disease, patients produce antibodies against their own nuclear proteins such as snRNP.]\n b. Mechanism:  The binding of snRNP brings the sequences of \nneighboring exons into the correct alignment for splicing, allowing two transesterification reactions (catalyzed by the RNA of U2, U5, and U6) to occur. The 2 \u2032-OH group of an adenine \nnucleotide (known as the branch site A) in the intron attacks the phosphate at the 5 \u2032-end of the intron (splice-donor site), \nforming an unusual 2 \u2032\u21925\u2032-phosphodiester bond and creating \na \u201clariat\u201d structure (see \nFig. 36.18 ). The newly freed 3 \u2032-OH of \nexon 1 attacks the 5 \u2032-phosphate at the splice acceptor site, \nforming a phosphodiester bond that joins exons 1 and 2. The excised intron is released as a lariat, which is typically degraded \nbut may be a precursor for ncRNA such as snoRNA. [Note: The GU and AG sequences at the beginning and end, respectively, of introns are invariant. However, additional sequences are critical for splice-site recognition.] After introns have been removed and exons joined, the mature mRNA molecules pass into the cytosol through pores in the nuclear membrane. [Note: The introns in tRNA (see \nFig. 36.16 ) are removed by a different mechanism.]\n c. Effect of splice site mutations:  Mutations at splice sites \ncan lead to improper splicing and the production of aberrant proteins. It is estimated that at least 20% of all genetic diseases are a result of mutations that affect RNA splicing. For example, mutations that cause the incorrect splicing of \u03b2-globin mRNA \nare responsible for some cases of \u03b2-thalassemia, a disease in \nwhich the production of the \u03b2-globin protein is defective (see \np. 115). Splice site mutations can result in exons being skipped (removed) or introns retained. They can also activate cryptic splice sites, which are sites that contain the 5 \u2032 or 3 \u2032 consensus \nsequence but are not normally used.\n 4. Alternative splicing:  The pre-mRNA molecules from >90% \nof human genes can be spliced in alternative ways in different tissues. Because this produces multiple variations of the mRNA and, therefore, of its protein product (\nFig. 36.19 ), it is a mecha-\nnism for producing a large, diverse set of proteins from a limited set of genes. For example, the mRNA for tropomyosin (TM), an actin filament\u2013binding protein of the cytoskeleton (and of the contrac-tile apparatus in muscle cells), undergoes extensive tissue-specific alternative splicing with production of multiple isoforms of the TM protein.\nFigure 36.18\nSplicing.

Chapter Summary\nThree major types of RNA participate in the process of protein synthesis: ribosomal RNA  (rRNA ), transfer RNA  (tRNA ), \nand messenger RNA  (mRNA ), as shown in Figure 36.20 . They are unbranched polymers of nucleotides but differ from \nDNA by containing ribose  instead of deoxyribose and uracil  instead of thymine. rRNA  is a component of the ribosomes . \ntRNA  serves as an adaptor  molecule that carries a specific amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. mRNA  (coding \nRNA) carries genetic information from DNA for use in protein synthesis. The process of RNA synthesis is called tran-\nscription , and the substrates are ribonucleoside triphosphates . The enzyme that synthesizes RNA is RNA polymerase  \n(RNA pol ). In prokaryotic  cells, the core enzyme  has five subunits (2 \u03b1, 1 \u03b2, 1 \u03b2\u2032, and 1 \u03a9) and possesses 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 poly-\nmerase  activity  needed for transcription. The core enzyme requires an additional subunit, sigma ( \u03c3) factor , to recog-\nnize the nucleotide sequence ( promoter  region) at the beginning of the DNA to be transcribed. This region contains \nconsensus sequences  that are highly conserved and include the \u2212 10 Pribnow box  and the \u2212 35 sequence . Another \nprotein, rho (\u03c1), is required for termination  of transcription of some genes. There are three distinct types of RNA pol  in \nthe nucleus of eukaryotic  cells. RNA pol I  synthesizes the precursor of rRNA in the nucleolus. In the nucleoplasm, RNA \npol II  synthesizes the precursors for mRNA and some noncoding RNA, and RNA pol III  synthesizes the precursors of \ntRNA and 5S rRNA. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, RNA pol  does not require a primer. Proofreading involves the \npolymerase  backtracking and cleaving the transcript. Core promoters  for genes transcribed by RNA pol II  contain cis-\nacting  consensus sequences, such as the TATA  (Hogness ) box, which serve as binding sites for trans-acting general \ntranscription factors . Upstream of these are proximal  regulatory elements, such as the CAAT and GC boxes, and \ndistal  regulatory elements, such as enhancers . Specific transcription factors  (transcriptional activators) and Mediator \ncomplex  bind these elements and regulate the frequency of transcription initiation, the response to signals such as \nhormones, and which genes are expressed at any given time. Eukaryotic transcription requires that the chromatin  be \nrelaxed (decondensed) in a process known as chromatin remodeling . A primary transcript  is a linear copy of a tran-\nscription unit , the segment of DNA between specific initiation and termination sequences. The primary transcripts of \nboth prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNA and rRNA are posttranscriptionally modified . The rRNA are synthesized from \nlong precursor molecules called pre-rRNA . These precursors are cleaved and trimmed by ribonucleases , producing the \nthree largest rRNA, and bases and sugars are modified. Eukaryotic 5S rRNA is synthesized by RNA pol III  and is modi-\nfied separately. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNA are also made from longer precursor molecules ( pre-tRNA ). If present, \nan intron is removed by nucleases , and both ends of the molecule are trimmed by ribonucleases . A 3\u2032-CCA  sequence \nis added, and bases at specific positions are modified. Prokaryotic mRNA is generally identical to its primary transcript, whereas eukaryotic pre-mRNA  is extensively modified co- and posttranscriptionally. For example, a 7-methylguano-\nsine cap  is attached to the 5 \u2032-end of the mRNA through a 5 \u2032\u21925\u2032 linkage. A long poly-A tail , not transcribed from the \nDNA, is attached by polyadenylate polymerase  to the 3 \u2032-end of most mRNA. Most eukaryotic mRNA also contains i nter-\nvening sequences  (introns ) that must be removed for the mRNA to be functional. Their removal, as well as the joining \nof expressed sequences  (exons ), requires a spliceosome  composed of small  nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles  \n(\u201csnurps\u201d ) that mediate the process of splicing . Eukaryotic mRNA is monocistronic , containing information from just \none gene, whereas prokaryotic mRNA is polycistronic .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   628 24-10-2020   12:13:11"

A 54-year-old male patient came to hospital with \ncomplaint of cough for a month and sometimes blood-stained sputum. He also had fever, espe-cially at night, and loss of weight. The doctor ordered blood tests, chest X-ray and sputum for acid-fast bacilli. The X-ray results showed clas-sical upper lobe infiltrates with cavities consis-tent with a tuberculosis chest infection. Report for acid-fast bacilli was positive.\n The doctor started the patient on five drugs which \nalso included rifampicin. The patient is sceptical about taking rifampicin as he gives service in a leprosy home where rifampicin is given to leprosy patients.\nA. What is the mechanism of action of rifampicin?\nB. Is this drug effective in tuberculosis and \nleprosy both?Answer:  Rifampicin inhibits transcription initiation by \nbinding to the beta subunit of prokaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Rifampicin is further able to cross blood-brain barrier and is also effective for intracellular bacteria as it crosses the cell membrane because of its lipid solubility.\n Rifampicin is exceptionally bactericidal for \nMycobacterium leprae as well as effective against M. tuberculosis. Hence it is used in treatment of both tuberculosis and leprosy.\nAnswer:  \u03b2-thalassemia can be caused by mutations \nthat affect globin gene expression including transcrip-tion, posttranscriptional modifications, translation or post-translational modifications. The most common defects are mutations that cause derangement in splicing of the mRNA precursor. \n Since thalassemias are inherited disorders, it is impor-\ntant to know the variants that the parents carry. This will be useful for their own health, understanding the genetic traits that the family carries, and prenatal diagnosis of disease.36.2.

Because the mutation creates an \nadditional splice-acceptor site (the 3 \u2032-end) upstream of \nthe normal acceptor site of intron 1, the 19 nucleotides that are usually found at the 3 \u2032-end of the excised intron 1 \nlariat can remain behind as part of exon 2.

            "Text": "37 Protein Synthesis\nI. OVERVIEW\nGenetic information, stored in the chromosomes and transmitted to \ndaughter cells through DNA replication, is expressed through transcription to RNA and, in the case of messenger RNA (mRNA), subsequent translation into proteins (polypeptides) as shown in \nFigure 37.1 . [Note: The proteome \nis the complete set of proteins expressed in a cell.] The process of protein synthesis is called translation because the \u201clanguage\u201d of the nucleotide sequence on the mRNA is translated into the language of an amino acid sequence. Translation requires a genetic code, through which the infor-mation contained in the nucleotide sequence is expressed to produce a specific amino acid sequence. Any alteration in the nucleotide sequence may result in an incorrect amino acid being inserted into the protein, poten-tially causing disease or even death of the organism. Newly made immature (nascent) proteins undergo a number of processes to achieve their func-tional form. They must fold properly, and misfolding can result in aggrega-tion or degradation of the protein. Many proteins are covalently modified to alter their activities. Lastly, proteins are targeted to their final intra- or extra-cellular destinations by signals present in the proteins themselves.\nII. THE GENETIC CODE\nThe genetic code is a \u201cdictionary\u201d that identifies the correspondence between a sequence of nucleotide bases and a sequence of amino acids. Each individual \u201cword\u201d in the code is composed of three nucleotide bases. These genetic words are called codons.Learning Objectives \nAt the end of this chapter, the student will be able to demonstrate an \nunderstanding of:\n\u2022 Genetic code\n\u2022 The process of protein synthesis \u2022 Mutations \u2022 Protein targeting \u2022 Posttranslational modifications\n5\u02b9 3\u02b9\nProteinmRNA\nN-terminu s C-terminu sProtein-coding regiontRNADNA\nrRNA28S5S\n5.8S\n18STRANSCRIPTION\nTRANSLATIONUTR UTR\nFigure 37.1\nProtein synthesis or translation. \ntRNA = transfer RNA; rRNA = ribosomal RNA; mRNA = messenger RNA; UTR = untranslated region.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   633 24-10-2020   12:13:13"

Their nucleotide sequences are always written from the 5 \u2032-end to the 3 \u2032-end. The four nucleotide bases are \nused to produce the three-base codons. Therefore, 64 different combi-nations of bases exist, taken three at a time (a triplet code), as shown in the table in \nFigure 37.2 .\n 1. How to translate a codon:  This table can be used to translate any \ncodon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence. For example, the codon AUG codes for methi-onine ([Met], see \nFig. 37.2 ). [Note: AUG is the initiation (start) codon \nfor translation.] Sixty-one of the 64 codons code for the 20 standard amino acids.\n 2. Termination codons:  Three of the codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, \ndo not code for amino acids but, rather, are termination (also called stop, or nonsense) codons. When one of these codons appears in an mRNA sequence, synthesis of the polypeptide coded for by that mRNA stops.\nB.

Specificity:  The genetic code is specific (unambiguous), because a \nparticular codon always codes for the same amino acid.\n 2. Universality:  The genetic code is virtually universal insofar as its \nspecificity has been conserved from very early stages of evolution, with only slight differences in the manner in which the code is trans-lated. [Note: An exception occurs in mitochondria, in which a few codons have meanings different than those shown in \nFigure 37.2 . \nFor example, UGA codes for tryptophan (Trp).]\n 3. Degeneracy:  The genetic code is degenerate (sometimes called \nredundant). Although each codon corresponds to a single amino acid, a given amino acid may have more than one triplet coding for it. For example, arginine (Arg) is specified by six different codons (see \nFig. 37.2 ). Only Met and Trp have just one coding triplet.\n 4. Nonoverlapping and commaless:  The genetic code is nonover-\nlapping and commaless, meaning that the code is read from a fixed starting point as a continuous sequence of bases, taken three at a time without any punctuation between codons. For example, AGCUGGAUACAU is read as AGC UGG AUA CAU.\nC. Consequences of altering the nucleotide sequence\nChanging a single nucleotide base (a point mutation) in the coding region of an mRNA can lead to any one of three results (\nFig. 37.3 ).\n 1. Silent mutation:  The codon containing the changed base may code \nfor the same amino acid. For example, if the serine (Ser) codon UCA is changed at the third base and becomes UCU, it still codes for Ser. This is termed a silent mutation.\n 2. Missense mutation:  The codon containing the changed base may \ncode for a different amino acid. For example, if the Ser codon UCA is changed at the first base and becomes CCA, it will code for a different amino acid (in this case, proline [Pro]). This is termed a missense mutation.\n 3. Nonsense mutation:  The codon containing the changed base \nmay become a termination codon. For example, if the Ser codon UCA is changed at the second base and becomes UAA, the new codon causes premature termination of translation at that point and the production of a shortened (truncated) protein. This is termed a nonsense mutation. [Note: The nonsense-mediated degradation pathway can degrade mRNA containing premature stops.]\n 4. Other mutations:  These can alter the amount or structure of the \nprotein produced by translation.\n a. Trinucleotide repeat expansion:  Occasionally, a sequence \nof three bases that is repeated in tandem will become ampli-fied in number so that too many copies of the triplet occur. If this happens within the coding region of a gene, the protein will contain many extra copies of one amino acid. For example, expansion of the CAG codon in exon 1 of the gene for huntingtin protein leads to the insertion of many extra glutamine residues in UAA\n(Termination codon)\nNonsense\nmutation\nUCA\n(Codon for serine)\nMissense\nmutation\nCCA\n(Codon for proline)UC U\n(Codon for serine)Silent\nmutation\nFigure 37.3\nPossible effects of changing a single \nnucleotide base in the coding region of a messenger RNA.

The additional glutamines result in an abnor-\nmally long protein that is cleaved, producing toxic fragments that aggregate in neurons. If the trinucleotide repeat expansion occurs in an untranslated region (UTR) of a gene, the result can be a decrease in the amount of protein produced, as seen in fragile X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy. Over 20 triplet expansion diseases are known. [Note: In fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of intellectual disability in males, the expansion results in gene silencing through DNA hypermethyl-ation (see p. 667).]\n b. Splice site mutations:  Mutations at splice sites (see p. 626) \ncan alter the way in which introns are removed from pre-mRNA molecules, producing aberrant proteins. [Note: In myotonic dystrophy, a muscle disorder, gene silencing is the result of splicing alterations due to triplet expansion.]\n c. Frameshift mutations:  If one or two nucleotides are either \ndeleted from or added to the coding region of an mRNA, a frameshift mutation occurs, altering the reading frame. This can result in a product with a radically different amino acid sequence or a truncated product due to the eventual creation of a termination codon (\nFig. 37.5 ). If three nucleotides are added, \na new amino acid is added to the peptide. If three are deleted, an amino acid is lost. Loss of three nucleotides maintains the reading frame but can result in serious pathology. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic, progressive, inherited disease that primarily affects the pulmonary and digestive systems, is most commonly caused by deletion of three nucleotides from the coding region of a gene, resulting in the loss of phenylala-nine (Phe, or F) at the 508th position ( \u0394F508) in the CF trans-\nmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein encoded by that gene. This \u0394F508 mutation prevents normal folding \nof CFTR, leading to its destruction by the proteasome. CFTR normally functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells, and its loss results in the production of thick, sticky secretions in the lungs and pancreas, leading to lung damage and digestive defi-ciencies. The incidence of CF is highest (1 in 3,300) in those of Northern European origin. In >70% of individuals with CF, the \u0394F508 mutation is the cause of the disease.\nIII. COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR TRANSLATION\nA large number of components are required for the synthesis of a protein. \nThese include all the amino acids that are found in the finished product, the mRNA to be translated, transfer RNA (tRNA) for each of the amino acids, functional ribosomes, energy sources, and enzymes as well as noncatalytic protein factors needed for the initiation, elongation, and termination steps of polypeptide chain synthesis.\nA. Amino acids\nAll the amino acids that eventually appear in the finished protein must be present at the time of protein synthesis. If one amino acid is missing, translation stops at the codon specifying that amino acid.

Transfer RNA\nAt least one specific type of tRNA is required for each amino acid. In humans, there are at least 50 species of tRNA, whereas bacteria contain at least 30 species. Because there are only 20 different amino acids commonly carried by tRNA, some amino acids have more than one specific tRNA molecule. This is particularly true of those amino acids that are coded for by several codons.\n 1. Amino acid attachment site:  Each tRNA molecule has an attach-\nment site for a specific (cognate) amino acid at its 3 \u2032-end (\nFig. 37.6 ). \nThe carboxyl group of the amino acid is in an ester linkage with the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the ribose portion of the A nucleotide in the \u2013CCA \nsequence at the 3 \u2032-end of the tRNA. [Note: A tRNA with a covalently \nattached (activated) amino acid is charged. Without an attached amino acid, it is uncharged.]\n 2. Anticodon:  Each tRNA molecule also contains a three-base nucleo-\ntide sequence, the anticodon, which pairs with a specific codon on the mRNA (see \nFig. 37.6 ). This codon specifies the insertion into the \ngrowing polypeptide chain of the amino acid carried by that tRNA.\nC. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases\nThis family of 20 different enzymes is required for attachment of amino acids to their corresponding tRNA. Each member of this family recog-nizes a specific amino acid and all the tRNA that correspond to that amino acid (isoaccepting tRNA, up to five per amino acid). Aminoacyl-\ntRNA synthetases  catalyze a two-step reaction that results in the cova-\nlent attachment of the \u03b1-carboxyl group of an amino acid to the A \nin the \u2013CCA sequence at the 3 \u2032-end of its corresponding tRNA. The \noverall reaction requires ATP , which is cleaved to adenosine monophos-phate and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP\ni), as shown in Figure 37.7 . The \nextreme specificity of the synthetases  in recognizing both the amino \nacid and its cognate tRNA contributes to the high fidelity of translation of the genetic message. In addition to their synthetic activity, the amino-\nacyl-tRNA synthetases  have a proofreading, or editing activity that can \nremove an incorrect amino acid from the enzyme or the tRNA molecule.\nD. Messenger RNA\nThe specific mRNA required as a template for the synthesis of the desired polypeptide must be present. [Note: In eukaryotes, mRNA is circularized for use in translation.]\nE. Functionally competent ribosomes\nAs shown in Figure 37.8 , ribosomes are large complexes of protein and \nribosomal RNA (rRNA), in which rRNA predominates. They consist of two subunits (one large and one small) whose relative sizes are given in terms of their sedimentation coefficients, or S (Svedberg) values. [Note: Because the S values are determined by both shape and size, their numeric values are not strictly additive.

Protein Synthesis\neukaryotic 60S and 40S subunits form an 80S ribosome.] Prokaryotic \nand eukaryotic ribosomes are similar in structure and serve the same function, namely, as the macromolecular complexes in which the synthesis of proteins occurs.\nThe small ribosomal subunit binds mRNA and determines \nthe accuracy of translation by insuring correct base-pairing between the mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon. The large ribosomal subunit catalyzes formation of the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues in a protein.\n 1. Ribosomal RNA:  As discussed on p. 639, prokaryotic ribosomes \ncontain three size species of rRNA, whereas eukaryotic ribosomes contain four (see \nFig. 37.8 ). The rRNA are generated from a single \npre-rRNA by the action of ribonucleases , and some bases and \nriboses are modified.\n 2. Ribosomal proteins:  Ribosomal proteins are present in greater \nnumbers in eukaryotic ribosomes than in prokaryotic ribosomes. These proteins play a variety of roles in the structure and function of the ribosome and its interactions with other components of the trans-lation system.\n 3. A, P, and E sites:  The ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA \nmolecules: the A, P, and E sites, each of which extends over both subunits. Together, they cover three neighboring codons. During translation, the A site binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA as directed by the codon currently occupying this site. This codon specifies the next amino acid to be added to the growing peptide chain. The P site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA. This tRNA carries the chain of amino acids that has already been synthesized. The E site is occu-pied by the empty tRNA as it is about to exit the ribosome. (See \nFig. 37.13  for an illustration of the role of the A, P, and E sites in \ntranslation.)\n 4. Cellular location:  In eukaryotic cells, the ribosomes either are free \nin the cytosol or are in close association with the endoplasmic retic-ulum (which is then known as the rough endoplasmic reticulum, or RER). RER-associated ribosomes are responsible for synthe-sizing proteins (including glycoproteins; see p. 273) that are to be exported from the cell, incorporated into membranes, or imported into lysosomes (see p. 275 for an overview of the latter process). Cytosolic ribosomes synthesize proteins required in the cytosol itself or destined for the nucleus, mitochondria, or peroxisomes. [Note: Mitochondria contain their own ribosomes (55S) and their own unique, circular DNA. Most mitochondrial proteins, however, are encoded by nuclear DNA, synthesized completely in the cytosol, and then targeted to mitochondria.]\nF. Protein factors\nInitiation, elongation, and termination (or, release) factors are required for polypeptide synthesis. Some of these protein factors perform a catalytic function, whereas others appear to stabilize the synthetic machinery.

See p. 191 for a discus-sion of the membrane-associated G proteins.]\nG. Energy sources\nCleavage of four high-energy bonds (see p. 163) is required for the addition of one amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain: two from ATP in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase  reaction, one in the removal of \nPP\ni and one in the subsequent hydrolysis of the PP i, to two P i by pyro-\nphosphatase , and two from GTP , one for binding the aminoacyl-tRNA \nto the A site and one for the translocation step (see Fig. 37.13 , p. 643). \n[Note: Additional ATP and GTP molecules are required for initiation in eukaryotes, whereas an additional GTP molecule is required for termi-nation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.] Translation, then, is a major consumer of energy.\nIV. CODON RECOGNITION BY TRANSFER RNA\nCorrect pairing of the codon in the mRNA with the anticodon of the tRNA is essential for accurate translation (see \nFig. 37.6 ). Most tRNA (isoaccepting \ntRNA) recognize more than one codon for a given amino acid.\nA. Antiparallel binding between codon and anticodon\nBinding of the tRNA anticodon to the mRNA codon follows the rules of complementary and antiparallel binding, that is, the mRNA codon is read 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 by an anticodon pairing in the opposite (3 \u2032\u21925\u2032) orientation \n(\nFig. 37.9 ). [Note: Nucleotide sequences are always written in the 5 \u2032 to \n3\u2032 direction unless otherwise noted. Two nucleotide sequences orient in \nan antiparallel manner.]\nB. Wobble hypothesis\nThe mechanism by which a tRNA can recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid is described by the wobble hypothesis, which states that codon\u2013anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson-Crick rules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less stringent for the last base. The base at the 5 \u2032-end of the anticodon (the first base of the anticodon) is not as \nspatially defined as the other two bases. Movement of that first base allows nontraditional base-pairing with the 3 \u2032-base of the codon (the \nlast base of the codon). This movement is called wobble and allows a single tRNA to recognize more than one codon. Examples of these flexible pairings are shown in \nFigure 37.9 . The result of wobble is that \n61 tRNA species are not required to read the 61 codons that code for amino acids.\nV. STEPS IN TRANSLATION\nThe process of protein synthesis translates the 3-letter alphabet of nucle-otide sequences on mRNA into the 20-letter alphabet of amino acids that constitute proteins. The mRNA is translated from its 5 \u2032-end to its 3 \u2032-end, \nproducing a protein synthesized from its amino (N)-terminal end to its carboxyl (C)-terminal end.

Each coding region has \nits own initiation and termination codon and produces a separate species of polypeptide. In contrast, each eukaryotic mRNA has only one coding region (that is, it is monocistronic). The process of translation is divided into three separate steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Eukaryotic translation resembles that of prokaryotes in most aspects. Individual differ-ences are noted in the text.\nOne important difference is that translation and transcription \nare temporally linked in prokaryotes, with translation starting before transcription is completed as a consequence of the lack of a nuclear membrane in prokaryotes.\nA. Initiation\nInitiation of protein synthesis involves the assembly of the compo-\nnents of the translation system before peptide-bond formation occurs. These components include the two ribosomal subunits, the mRNA to be translated, the aminoacyl-tRNA specified by the first codon in the message, GTP , and initiation factors that facilitate the assembly of this initiation complex (see \nFig. 37.13 ). [Note: In prokaryotes, three initiation \nfactors are known (IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), whereas in eukaryotes, there are many (designated eIF to indicate eukaryotic origin). Eukaryotes also require ATP for initiation.] The following are two mechanisms by which the ribosome recognizes the nucleotide sequence (AUG) that initiates translation.\n 1. Shine-Dalgarno sequence:  In Escherichia coli (E. coli), a purine-\nrich sequence of nucleotide bases, known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, is located six to ten bases upstream of the initi-ating AUG codon on the mRNA molecule (that is, near its 5 \u2032-end). \nThe 16S rRNA component of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit has a nucleotide sequence near its 3 \u2032-end that is complementary to all \nor part of the SD sequence. Therefore, the 5 \u2032-end of the mRNA and \nthe 3 \u2032-end of the 16S rRNA can form complementary base pairs, \nfacilitating the positioning of the 30S subunit on the mRNA in close proximity to the initiating AUG codon (\nFig. 37.10 ).\n 2. 5 \u2032-Cap:  Eukaryotic mRNA does not have SD sequences. In eukary-\notes, the small (40S) ribosomal subunit (aided by members of the eIF-4 family of proteins) binds close to the cap structure at the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA and moves 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 along the mRNA until it \nencounters the initiator AUG. This scanning process requires ATP. Cap-independent initiation can occur if the 40S subunit binds to an internal ribosome entry site close to the start codon.

Steps in Translation 641\n[Note: Base modifications distinguish tRNA i from the tRNA used for \ninternal AUG codons.] In bacteria and mitochondria, tRNA i carries \nan N-formylated methionine (fMet), as shown in Figure 37.11 . After \nMet is attached to tRNA i, the formyl group is added by the enzyme \ntransformylase , which uses N10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (see p. 403) \nas the carbon donor. In eukaryotes, tRNA i carries a Met that is not \nformylated. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, this N-terminal Met is usually removed before translation is completed. The large ribosomal subunit then joins the complex, and a functional ribo-some is formed with the charged tRNA\ni in the P site. The A site \nis empty. [Note: Specific (e)IF function as anti-association factors and prevent premature addition of the large subunit.] The GTP on (e)IF-2 gets hydrolyzed to GDP. In eukaryotes, the guanine nucleo-tide exchange factor eIF-2B facilitates the reactivation of eIF-2-GDP through replacement of GDP by GTP.\nB. Elongation\nElongation of the polypeptide involves the addition of amino acids to the carboxyl end of the growing chain. Delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA whose codon appears next on the mRNA template in the ribosomal A site (a process known as decoding) is facilitated in E. coli by elongation factors EF-Tu-GTP and EF-Ts and requires GTP hydrolysis. [Note: In eukaryotes, comparable elongation factors are EF-1 \u03b1-GTP and EF-1 \u03b2\u03b3. \nBoth EF-Ts and EF-1 \u03b2\u03b3 function in guanine nucleotide exchange.] \nPeptide-bond formation between the \u03b1-carboxyl group of the amino \nacid in the P site and the \u03b1-amino group of the amino acid in the A site \nis catalyzed by peptidyltransferase , an activity intrinsic to an rRNA of \nthe large subunit (\nFig. 37.12 ). [Note: Because this rRNA catalyzes the \nreaction, it is a ribozyme (see p. 136).] After the peptide bond has been formed, the peptide on the tRNA at the P site is transferred to the amino acid on the tRNA at the A site, a process known as transpeptidation. The ribosome then advances three nucleotides toward the 3 \u2032-end of \nthe mRNA. This process is known as translocation and, in prokaryotes, requires the participation of EF-G-GTP (eukaryotes use EF-2-GTP) and GTP hydrolysis. Translocation causes movement of the uncharged tRNA from the P to the E site for release and movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site. The process is repeated until a termina-tion codon is encountered.

Such a \ncomplex of one mRNA and a number of ribosomes is called a poly-some, or polyribosome.]\nC. Termination\nTermination occurs when one of the three termination codons moves into the A site. These codons are recognized in E. coli by release factors: RF-1, which recognizes UAA and UAG, and RF-2, which recognizes UGA and UAA. The binding of these release factors results in hydro-lysis of the bond linking the peptide to the tRNA at the P site, causing the nascent protein to be released from the ribosome. A third release factor, RF-3-GTP , then causes the release of RF-1 or RF-2 as GTP is hydrolyzed (see \nFig. 37.13 ). [Note: Eukaryotes have a single release \nfactor, eRF , which recognizes all three termination codons. A second factor, eRF-3, functions like the prokaryotic RF-3. See \nFigure 37.14  for \na summary of the factors used in translation.] The steps in prokaryotic protein synthesis, as well as some antibiotic inhibitors of the process, are summarized in \nFigure 37.13 . The newly synthesized polypeptide \nmay undergo further modification as described below, and the ribo-somal subunits, mRNA, tRNA, and protein factors can be recycled and used to synthesize another polypeptide. [Note: In prokaryotes, ribo-some recycling factors mediate separation of the subunits. In eukary-otes, eRF and ATP hydrolysis are required.]\nD. Translation regulation\nGene expression is most commonly regulated at the transcriptional level, but translation may also be regulated. An important mechanism by which this is achieved in eukaryotes is by covalent modification of eIF-2: Phosphorylated eIF-2 is inactive (see p. 667). In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, regulation can also be achieved through proteins that bind mRNA and inhibit its use by blocking translation.\nE. Protein folding\nProteins must fold to assume their functional, native state. Folding can be spontaneous (as a result of the primary structure) or facilitated by proteins known as chaperones (see p. 95).\nF. Protein targeting\nAlthough most protein synthesis in eukaryotes is initiated in the cyto-plasm, many proteins perform their functions within subcellular organ-elles or outside of the cell. Such proteins normally contain amino acid sequences that direct the proteins to their final locations.\nProtein targeting is required for many proteins like secretory, mitochon-\ndrial and nuclear proteins. For example, secreted proteins are targeted during synthesis (cotranslational targeting) to the RER by the pres-ence of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence. The sequence is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleopro-tein that binds the ribosome, halts elongation, and delivers the ribo-some\u2013peptide complex to an RER membrane channel (the translocon) via interaction with the SRP receptor. Translation resumes, the protein enters the RER lumen, and its signal sequence is cleaved (\nFig. 37.15 ). \nThe protein moves through the RER and the Golgi, is processed, pack-aged into vesicles, and secreted.

Some precursor proteins are cleaved in \nthe RER or the Golgi; others are cleaved in developing secretory vesi-cles (for example, insulin; see \nFig. 27.4 , p. 437); and still others, such \nas collagen (see p. 126), are cleaved after secretion.\nB. Covalent attachments\nProtein function can be affected by the covalent attachment of a variety of chemical groups (\nFig. 37.16 ). Examples include the following.\n 1. Phosphorylation:  Phosphorylation occurs on the hydroxyl groups \nof serine, threonine, or, less frequently, tyrosine residues in a protein. It is catalyzed by one of a family of protein kinases  and \nmay be reversed by the action of protein phosphatases . The phos-\nphorylation may increase or decrease the functional activity of the protein. Several examples of phosphorylation reactions have been previously discussed (for example, see Chapter 16, p. 234, for the regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation).\n 2. Glycosylation:  Many of the proteins that are destined to become \npart of a membrane or to be secreted from a cell have carbohy-drate chains added en bloc to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine (N-linked) or built sequentially on the hydroxyl groups of a serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine (O-linked). N-glycosylation occurs in the RER and O-glycosylation in the Golgi. (The process of producing such glycoproteins was discussed on p. 272.) N-glycosylated acid \nhydrolases  are targeted to the matrix of lysosomes by the phos-\nphorylation of mannose residues at carbon 6 (see p. 276).\n 3. Hydroxylation:  Proline and lysine residues of the \u03b1 chains of \ncollagen are extensively hydroxylated by vitamin C\u2013dependent hydroxylases  in the RER (see p. 127).\n 4. Other covalent modifications:  These may be required for the func-\ntional activity of a protein. For example, additional carboxyl groups can be added to glutamate residues by vitamin K\u2013dependent carboxylation (see p. 543). The resulting \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla) \nresidues are essential for the activity of several of the blood-clot-ting proteins. Biotin is covalently bound to the \u03b5-amino groups of \nlysine residues of biotin-dependent enzymes that catalyze carboxyl-ation reactions such as pyruvate carboxylase  (see Fig. 15.3, p. 218). \nAttachment of lipids, such as farnesyl groups, can help anchor proteins to membranes (see p. 345). Many eukaryotic proteins are cotranslationally acetylated at the N-end. [Note: Reversible acetyla-tion of histone proteins influences gene expression (see p. 667).]\n   Chaperones  are proteins which play a role in assembly and proper \nfolding of synthesized proteins. This is important for the proteins to now become biologically active. Chaperones are present in various parts of cell like cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. Chaperones usually exhibit ATPase  activity and the binding of ATP and ADP has \nan important role in effective folding of the protein. They belong to a large family of proteins called heat shock proteins. Heat shock \nproteins  are also called stress proteins since they get activated in \npresence of cellular stress like exposure to radiations, free radicals and toxins.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   646 24-10-2020   12:13:24"

Protein degradation\nProteins that are defective (for example, misfolded) or destined for \nrapid turnover are often marked for destruction by ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of chains of a small, highly conserved protein called ubiquitin (see Fig. 24.3, p. 379). Proteins marked in this way are rapidly degraded by the proteasome, which is a macromolecular, ATP-dependent, proteolytic system located in the cytosol. For example, misfolding of the CFTR protein (see p. 636) results in its proteasomal degradation. [Note: If folding is impeded, unfolded proteins accumulate in the RER causing stress that triggers the unfolded protein response, in which the expression of chaperones is increased; global translation is decreased by eIF-2 phosphorylation; and the unfolded proteins are sent to the cytosol, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the proteasome by a process called ER-associated degradation.]\nVII. Medical Perspectives\nProtein synthesis inhibitors are used as drugs against bacterium. However, \nsome toxins also inhibit eukaryotic protein synthesis and cause human disease. Further, some genetic diseases, diseases of posttranslational modifications and protein folding errors are also clinically relevant.\nDrugs\nStreptomycin  is bactericidal against dividing Mycobacterium tuberculosis \nas it inhibits its protein synthesis by binding to the 30S mycobacterial ribosome\nTetracycline  inhibits the initiation process of protein synthesis in bacteria \nby binding to the 30S subunit and further inhibiting the binding of the aminoacyl tRNA. \nChloramphenicol  inhibits the process of elongation during protein \nsynthesis by inhibiting the peptidyl transferase  activity.\nErythromycin  inhibits translocation by binding to the 50S subunit of the \nribosome.\nToxins \nDiphtheria is a serious infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. \nIt causes difficulty in breathing, painful swallowing and may progress to serious complications. C. diphtheriae produces a protein toxin which binds to the EF-2 in eukaryotes and therefore stops translocation. Diphtheria vaccination is provided to all children under the National Immunization Programme of India.\nRicin,  a toxic lectin naturally found in castor beans, prevents aminoacyl \ntRNA from binding to the A site. This inhibits protein synthesis.\nDiseases \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease , a very common form of dementia, may be caused \nby abnormal folding of proteins, unassisted by chaperones. It is character-ized by senile neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cerebral amyloid deposits. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   648 24-10-2020   12:13:25"

They are always written 5\u2032\u21923\u2032. Of the 64 possible three-base combinations, 61 \ncode for the 20 standard amino acids and 3 signal termination of protein synthesis ( translation ). Altering the nucleotide \nsequence in a codon can cause silent mutations  (the altered codon codes for the original amino acid), missense muta-\ntions  (the altered codon codes for a different amino acid), or nonsense mutations  (the altered codon is a termination \ncodon). Characteristics of the genetic code include specificity , universality , and degeneracy , and it is nonoverlapping  \nand commaless  (Fig. 37.17 ). Requirements for protein synthesis include all the amino acids  that eventually appear in the \nfinished protein; at least one specific type of transfer RNA  (tRNA ) for each amino acid; one aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase  \nfor each amino acid; the mRNA  coding for the protein to be synthesized; fully competent ribosomes  (70S in prokaryotes, \n80S in eukaryotes); protein factors  needed for initiation, elongation, and termination of protein synthesis; and ATP and \nguanosine triphosphate  (GTP) as energy sources. tRNA has an attachment site for a specific amino acid at its 3 \u2032-end \nand an anticodon region that can recognize the codon specifying the amino acid the tRNA is carrying. Ribosomes are large complexes of protein  and ribosomal RNA  (rRNA ). They consist of two subunits , 30S and 50S in prokaryotes and \n40S and 60S in eukaryotes. Each ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA molecules: the A, P , and E sites that cover three neighboring codons. The A site  binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA , the P site  is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA , \nand the E site  is occupied by the empty tRNA  as it is about to exit the ribosome. Recognition of an mRNA codon is \naccomplished by the tRNA anticodon , which binds to the codon following the rules of complementarity  and antiparallel  \nbinding. The wobble hypothesis  states that the first (5 \u2032) base of the anticodon is not as spatially defined as the other two \nbases. Movement of that first base allows nontraditional base-pairing with the last (3 \u2032) base of the codon, thus allowing a \nsingle tRNA to recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid. For initiation  of protein synthesis, the compo-\nnents of the translation system are assembled, and mRNA associates with the small ribosomal subunit. The process requires initiation factors  (IF). In prokaryotes , a purine-rich region of the mRNA (the Shine-Dalgarno sequence ) base-\npairs with a complementary sequence on 16S rRNA, resulting in the positioning of the small subunit on the mRNA so that translation can begin. The 5\u2032-cap  (bound by proteins of the eIF-4 family) on eukaryotic mRNA  is used to position the \nsmall subunit on the mRNA. The initiation codon  is AUG , and N-formylmethionine  is the initiating amino acid in prokary-\notes, whereas methionine  is used in eukaryotes. The charged initiating tRNA (tRNA\ni) is brought to the P site by (e)IF-2 . \nIn elongation , the polypeptide chain is lengthened by the addition of amino acids to the carboxyl end of its growing \nchain. The process requires elongation factors  that facilitate the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site as well as \nthe movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. The formation of the peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyltransferase , \nwhich is an activity intrinsic to the rRNA of the large subunit and, therefore, is a ribozyme . Following peptide-bond forma-\ntion, the ribosome advances along the mRNA in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction  to the next codon ( translocation ). Because of the \nlength of most mRNA, more than one ribosome at a time can translate a message, forming a polysome . Termination  \nbegins when one of the three termination codons moves into the A site. These codons are recognized by release factors . \nThe newly synthesized protein is released from the ribosomal complex, and the ribosome is dissociated from the mRNA. Initiation , elongation , and termination  are driven by the hydrolysis of GTP . Initiation in eukaryotes also requires ATP for \nscanning . Numerous antibiotics  interfere with the process of protein synthesis. Many polypeptide chains are covalently \nmodified during or after translation. Such modifications include amino acid removal ; phosphorylation,  which may acti-\nvate or inactivate the protein; glycosylation , which plays a role in protein targeting ; and hydroxylation  such as that \nseen in collagen. Protein targeting can be either cotranslational  (as with secreted proteins) or posttranslational  (as with \nmitochondrial matrix proteins). Proteins must fold to achieve their functional form. Folding can be spontaneous or facil-\nitated by chaperones . Proteins that are defective (for example, misfolded) or destined for rapid turnover are marked for \ndestruction by the attachment of chains of a small, highly conserved protein called ubiquitin . Ubiquitinated proteins are \nrapidly degraded by a cytosolic complex known as the proteasome .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   649 24-10-2020   12:13:26"

Mutating the normal termination \n(stop) codon from UAA to CAA in \u03b2-globin messenger RNA \ncauses the ribosome to insert a glutamine at that point. It will continue extending the protein chain until it comes upon the next stop codon farther down the message, resulting in an abnormally long protein. The replacement of CGA (arginine) with UGA (stop) would cause the protein to be too short. GAU and GAC both code for aspartate and would cause no change in the protein. Changing GCA (alanine) to GAA (glutamate) would not change the size of the protein product. A change from UAA to UAG would simply change one termination codon for another and would have no effect on the protein.37.1.

Because fMet-Phe (formylated methi-\nonyl-phenylalanine) is made, the ribosomes must be able to complete initiation, bind Phe-tRNA to the A site, and use peptidyltransferase  activity to form the first peptide \nbond. Because the ribosome is not able to proceed any further, ribosomal movement (translocation) is most likely the inhibited step. Therefore, the ribosome is stopped before it reaches the termination codon of this message.37.2. A pharmaceutical company is studying a new \nantibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.

As the N-terminal signal sequence of the peptide emerges from the ribo-some, it is bound by the signal recognition particle, taken to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), threaded into the lumen, and cleaved as translation continues. The proteins move through the RER and the Golgi and undergo processing such as N-glycosylation (RER) and O-glycosylation (Golgi). In the Golgi, they are packaged in secretory vesicles and released from the cell. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is associated with synthesis of lipids, not proteins, and has no ribosomes attached.

OVERVIEW\nGene expression refers to the multistep process that ultimately results in \nthe production of a functional gene product, either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein. The first step in gene expression, the use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for the synthesis of RNA (transcription), is the primary site of regu-lation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, however, gene expression also involves extensive posttranscriptional and posttranslational processes as well as actions that influence access to particular regions of the DNA. Each of these steps can be regulated to provide additional control over the kinds and amounts of functional products that are produced.\nAll somatic cells have same genes with the exception of amplified and rear-\nranged genes. Organisms adapt to environmental (cellular and external) changes by altering gene expression. Cells do not express all their genes. Also, not all genes are tightly regulated. For example, genes described as constitutive encode products required for basic cellular functions and so are expressed at essentially a constant level. They are also known as \u201chousekeeping\u201d genes . Regulated genes, however, are expressed only \nunder certain conditions . They may be expressed in all cells or in only a \nsubset of cells, for example, hepatocytes. This ability to express certain genes in particular cells in eukaryotes is called tissue-specific expression . \nThe ability to regulate gene expression (that is, to determine if, how much, and when particular gene products will be made) gives the cell control over structure and function. It is the basis for cellular differentiation, morpho-genesis, and adaptability of any organism. Control of gene expression is best understood in prokaryotes, but many themes are repeated in eukary-otes.\n Figure 38.1  shows some of the sites where gene expression can be \ncontrolled.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Describe basic concepts of prokaryotic gene expression like lac operon \nand molecular switch\n\u2022 Describe the special features of eukaryotic gene expression \u2022 Explain DNA motifs \u2022 Describe how knowledge of gene expression can be used for medical \ncare A\nBProkaryote s\nEukaryote sProtein\nProtein sDNA\nDNA\nPrimary RNA tran scriptIntron sExon smRNATran scription\nTran slation\nTran scriptionFor mo st gene s,\nthe main site \nof control i s the \ntranscription of \nDNA to RNA.\nIn eukaryote s, gene expre ssion is\nalso controlled at po sttran scriptional\nand po sttran slational proce sses.mRNA i soform s\nModified protein s\nFigure 38.1\nControl of gene expression. \nmRNA = messenger RNA.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   655 24-10-2020   12:13:28"

Regulation of Gene Expression\nWe can understand some key concepts of gene expression by first under-\nstanding the response of gene to a signal (type A, B, and C responses) , \nlac operon system  in prokaryotes (an example of de-repression), trypto-\nphan operon in prokaryotes (example of control by attenuation) and the \nprokaryotic molecular switch  (genes regulating each other\u2019s expression).\nType A  response to a gene signal implies that there will be increased expres-\nsion of a gene only till the signal is present. Once the signal is removed, expression of the gene will come back to basal levels. Prokaryotic response to nutrients and eukaryotic response to hormones are examples of type A response. In type B  response, increased amount of gene expression is \ntransient even in the continued presence of regulatory signal. Some devel-opmental gene expressions follow type B responses. Type C  response, like \nresponse to Cro protein, is the increased expression of gene response that persists indefinitely even after termination of the regulatory signal.\nII. REGULATORY SEQUENCES AND MOLECULES\nRegulation of transcription, the initial step in all gene expression, is controlled by regulatory sequences of DNA that are usually embedded in the noncoding regions of the genome. The interaction between these DNA sequences and regulatory molecules, such as transcription factors , can \ninduce or repress the transcriptional machinery, influencing the kinds and amounts of products that are produced. The regulatory DNA sequences are called cis-acting because they influence expression of genes on the same chromosome as the regulatory sequence (see p. 622). The regulatory mole-cules are called trans-acting because they can diffuse (transit) through the cell from their site of synthesis to their DNA-binding sites (\nFig. 38.2 ). For \nexample, a protein transcription factor (a trans-acting molecule) that regu-lates a gene on chromosome 6 might itself have been produced from a gene on chromosome 11. The binding of proteins to DNA is through struc-\ntural motifs such as the zinc finger (\nFig. 38.3 ), leucine zipper ( Fig. 38.4 ), \nor helix-turn-helix  (Fig. 38.5 ) in the protein.\nMotifs mediate the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA. This binding to \nDNA is of high affinity, involving small regions of protein and maintained by H-bonds, ionic interactions and van der Waals forces. Helix-turn-helix  \nbinding can be understood by the example of cro protein binding to DNA. Cro has three antiparallel beta sheets and three alpha helices. Cro binds to DNA through alpha helix 3 binding to 5 bp on major groove (\nFig. 38.5 ). \nAn example of zinc finger binding  is the binding of TF111A (a positive \nregulator of 5S RNA gene transcription) to DNA. There is a zinc bound to cysteine and/or histidine 12\u201313 amino acids apart. The presence of this zinc causes \u2018fingers\u201d to be made in the protein chain which now binds to 5 bp in successive major grooves of DNA (\nFigs 38.3A  and B). In the leucine \nzipper motif,  proteins form an alpha helix with a periodic repeat of leucine \nresidues at every 7th position. This makes a leucine line on one side of the protein. These leucines on one side of the protein \u201czip\u201d with another such protein to form a DNA-binding region.\nAn example of leucine zipper motif is Fos and Jun regulatory proteins \n(\nFig. 38.4 ).

            "Text": "III. Regulation of Prokaryotic Gene Expression 657\nIII.  REGULATION OF PROKARYOTIC \nGENE EXPRESSION\nIn prokaryotes such as the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), regulation of \ngene expression occurs primarily at the level of transcription and, in general, is mediated by the binding of trans-acting proteins to cis-acting regulatory elements on their single DNA molecule (chromosome). [Note: Regulating the first step in the expression of a gene is an efficient approach, insofar as energy is not wasted making unneeded gene products.] Transcriptional control in prokaryotes can involve the initiation or premature termination of transcription.\nA. Messenger RNA transcription from bacterial operons\nIn bacteria, the structural genes that encode proteins involved in a particular metabolic pathway are often found sequentially grouped on the chromosome along with the cis-acting elements that regulate the transcription of these genes. The transcription product is a single poly-\ncistronic messenger RNA  ([mRNA], see p. 617). The genes are, thus, \ncoordinately regulated (that is, turned on or off as a unit). This entire package is referred to as an operon.\nB. Operators in bacterial operons\nBacterial operons contain an operator, a segment of DNA that regulates \nthe activity of the structural genes of the operon by reversibly binding a protein known as the repressor. If the operator is not bound by the repressor, RNA polymerase  (RNA pol ) binds the promoter, passes over \nthe operator, and reaches the protein-coding genes that it transcribes to mRNA. If the repressor is bound to the operator, the polymerase  \nis blocked and does not produce mRNA. As long as the repressor is bound to the operator, no mRNA (and, therefore, no proteins) are made. However, when an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor, causing the repressor to change shape so that it no longer binds the operator. When this happens, RNA pol  can initiate transcrip-\ntion.

Lactose operon\nThe lac operon contains the genes that code for three proteins involved \nin the catabolism of the disaccharide lactose: the lacZ gene codes for \u03b2-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes lactose to galactose and glucose; \nthe lacY gene codes for a permease , which facilitates the movement \nof lactose into the cell; and the lacA gene codes for thiogalactoside \ntransacetylase , which acetylates lactose. [Note: The physiologic func-\ntion of this acetylation is unknown.] All of these proteins are maximally produced only when lactose is available to the cell and glucose is not. [Note: Bacteria use glucose, if available, as a fuel in preference to any other sugar.] The regulatory portion of the operon is upstream of the three structural genes and consists of the promoter region where RNA \npol binds and two additional sites, the operator (O) and the catabolite \nactivator protein (CAP) sites, where regulatory proteins bind. The lacZ, lacY , and lacA genes are maximally expressed only when the O site is empty and the CAP site is bound by a complex of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ([cAMP], see p. 190) and the CAP , sometimes called the cAMP regulatory protein (CRP). A regulatory gene, the lacI gene, codes for the repressor protein (a trans-acting factor) that binds to the O site with high affinity. [Note: The lacI gene has its own promoter and is not part of the lac operon.]\n 1. When only glucose is available:  In this case, the lac operon is \nrepressed (turned off). Repression is mediated by the repressor protein binding via a helix-turn-helix motif (\nFig. 38.5 ) to the O site, \nwhich is downstream of the promoter (see Fig. 38.6A ). Binding of \nthe repressor interferes with the binding of RNA pol  to the promoter, \nthereby inhibiting transcription of the structural genes. This is an example of negative regulation.\n 2. When only lactose is available:  In this case, the lac operon is \ninduced (maximally expressed, or turned on). A small amount of lactose is converted to an isomer, allolactose. This compound is an inducer that binds to the repressor protein, changing its conforma-tion so that it can no longer bind to the O site. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase  is active, and cAMP is made and binds \nto the CAP . The cAMP\u2013CAP trans-acting complex binds to the CAP site, causing RNA pol  to initiate transcription with high efficiency at \nthe promoter site (see \nFig. 38.6B ). This is an example of positive \nregulation. The transcript is a single polycistronic mRNA molecule that contains three sets of start and stop codons. Translation of the mRNA produces the three proteins that allow lactose to be used for energy production by the cell. [Note: In contrast to the induc-ible lacZ, lacY , and lacA genes, whose expression is regulated, the lacI gene is constitutive. Its gene product, the repressor protein, is always made and is active unless the inducer is present.]\n 3. When both glucose and lactose are available:  In this case, the lac \noperon is uninduced, and transcription is negligible, even if lactose is present at a high concentration. Adenylyl cyclase  is inhibited in \nthe presence of glucose (a process known as catabolite repression) so no cAMP\u2013CAP complex forms, and the CAP site remains empty. Therefore, the RNA pol  is unable to effectively initiate transcription, \neven though the repressor is not bound to the O site. Consequently, the three structural genes of the operon are expressed only at a very low (basal) level (see \nFig. 38.6C ). [Note: Induction causes a 50-fold \nenhancement over basal expression.]\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   659 24-10-2020   12:13:32"

Tryptophan operon\nThe tryptophan (trp) operon contains five structural genes that code \nfor enzymes required for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. As with the lac operon, the trp operon is subject to negative control. However, for the repressible trp operon, negative control includes Trp itself binding to a repressor protein and facilitating the binding of the repressor to the operator: Trp is a corepressor. Because repression by Trp is not always complete, the trp operon, unlike the lac operon, is also regulated by a process known as attenuation. With attenua-tion, transcription is initiated but is terminated well before completion (\nFig. 38.7 ). If Trp is plentiful, transcription initiation that escaped repres-\nsion by Trp is attenuated (stopped) by the formation of an attenuator, a hairpin (stem-loop) structure in the mRNA similar to that seen in rho-independent termination (see p. 620). [Note: Because transcription and translation are temporally linked in prokaryotes (see p. 640), attenua-tion also results in the formation of a truncated, nonfunctional peptide product that is rapidly degraded.] If Trp becomes scarce, the operon is expressed. The 5 \u2032-end of the mRNA contains two adjacent codons for \nTrp. The lack of Trp causes ribosomes to stall at these codons, covering regions of the mRNA required for formation of the attenuation hairpin. This prevents attenuation and allows transcription to continue.\nTranscriptional attenuation can occur in prokaryotes because \ntranslation of an mRNA begins before its synthesis is complete. This does not occur in eukaryotes because the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus spatially and temporally separates transcription and translation.\nE.

REGULATION OF EUKARYOTIC GENE EXPRESSION\nThe higher degree of complexity of eukaryotic genomes, as well as the \npresence of a nuclear membrane, necessitates a wider range of regula-tory processes. As with the prokaryotes, transcription is the primary site of regulation. Again, the theme of trans-acting factors binding to cis-acting elements is seen. Operons, however, are not found in eukaryotes, which must use alternate strategies to solve the problem of how to coordinately regulate all the genes required for a specific response. In eukaryotes, gene expression is also regulated at multiple levels other than transcription. For example, the major modes of posttranscriptional regulation at the mRNA level are alternative mRNA splicing and polyadenylation, control of mRNA stability, and control of translational efficiency. Additional regulation at the protein level occurs by mechanisms that modulate stability, processing, or targeting of the protein.\nA. Coordinate regulation\nThe need to coordinately regulate a group of genes to cause a partic-ular response is of key importance in organisms with more than one chromosome. An underlying theme occurs repeatedly: A trans-acting protein functions as a specific transcription factor (STF) that binds to a cis-acting regulatory consensus sequence (see p. 594) on each of the genes in the group even if they are on different chromosomes. [Note: The STF has a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a transcription activa-tion domain (TAD). The TAD recruits coactivators, such as histone acet-\nyltransferases  (see p. 621), and the general transcription factors (see \np. 622) that, along with RNA pol , are required for formation of the tran-\nscription initiation complex at the promoter. Although the TAD recruits a variety of proteins, the specific effect of any one of them is depen-dent upon the protein composition of the complex. This is known as combinatorial control.] Examples of coordinate regulation in eukaryotes include the galactose circuit and the hormone response system.\n 1. Galactose circuit:  This regulatory scheme allows for the use \nof galactose when glucose is not available. In yeast, a unicel-lular organism, the genes required to metabolize galactose are on different chromosomes. Coordinated expression is mediated by the protein Gal4 (Gal = galactose), a STF that binds to a short regula-tory DNA sequence upstream of each of the genes. The sequence is called the upstream activating sequence Gal (UAS\nGal). Binding of \nGal4 to UAS Gal through zinc fingers in its DBD occurs in both the \nabsence and presence of galactose. When the sugar is absent, the regulatory protein Gal80 binds Gal4 at its TAD, thereby inhibiting gene transcription (\nFig. 38.10A ). When present, galactose activates \nthe Gal3 protein. Gal3 binds Gal80, thereby allowing Gal4 to acti-vate transcription (\nFig. 38.10B ). [Note: Glucose prevents the use of \ngalactose by inhibiting expression of Gal4 protein.]\n 2. Hormone response system:  Hormone response elements (HRE) \nare DNA sequences that bind trans-acting proteins and regulate gene expression in response to hormonal signals in multicellular organisms. Hormones bind to either intracellular (nuclear) receptors (for example, steroid hormones; see p. 361) or cell-surface recep-tors (for example, the peptide hormone glucagon; see p. 442).\n a.

Binding of the receptor\u2013hormone complex to the GRE allows coordinate expression of a group of target genes, even though these genes are on different chro-mosomes. The GRE can be located upstream or downstream of the genes it regulates and at great distances from them. The GRE, then, can function as a true enhancer (see p. 623). [Note: If associated with repressors, hormone\u2013receptor complexes inhibit transcription.]\n b. Cell-surface receptors:  These receptors include those for \ninsulin, epinephrine, and glucagon. Glucagon, for example, is a peptide hormone that binds its G protein\u2013coupled plasma membrane receptor on glucagon-responsive cells. This extra-cellular signal is then transduced to intracellular cAMP , a second messenger (\nFig. 38.12 ; also see Fig. 13.7 on p. 191), which can \naffect protein expression (and activity) through protein kinase A \u2013\nmediated phosphorylation. In response to a rise in cAMP , a trans-acting factor (cAMP response element\u2013binding [CREB] protein) is phosphorylated and activated. Active CREB protein binds via a leucine zipper motif to a cis-acting regulatory element, the cAMP response element (CRE), resulting in transcription of target genes with CRE in their promoters. [Note: The genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and glucose 6-phospha-\ntase, key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (see p. 222), are exam-\nples of genes upregulated by the cAMP/CRE/CREB system.]\nB. Messenger RNA processing and use\nEukaryotic mRNA undergoes several processing events before it is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for use in protein synthesis. Capping at the 5 \u2032-end (see p. 624), polyadenylation at the 3 \u2032-end (see \np. 442), and splicing (see p. 625) are essential for the production of a functional eukaryotic messenger from most pre-mRNA. Variations in splicing and polyadenylation can affect gene expression. In addition, messenger stability also affects gene expression.\n 1. Alternative splicing:  Tissue-specific protein isoforms can be made \nfrom the same pre-mRNA through alternative splicing, which can involve exon skipping (loss), intron retention, and use of alterna-tive splice-donor or -acceptor sites (\nFig. 38.13 ).

[Note: Over 90% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing.]\n 2. Alternative polyadenylation:  Some pre-mRNA transcripts have \nmore than one site for cleavage and polyadenylation. Alternative poly-adenylation (APA) generates mRNA with different 3 \u2032-ends, altering \nthe untranslated region (UTR) or the coding (translated) sequence. [Note: APA is involved in the production of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of immunoglobulin M.]\nThe use of alternative splicing and polyadenylation sites, as \nwell as alternative transcription start sites explains, at least in part, how the ~20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human genome can give rise to well over 100,000 proteins.\n 3. Messenger RNA editing:  Even after mRNA has been fully \nprocessed, it may undergo an additional posttranscriptional modifi-cation in which a base in the mRNA is altered. This is known as RNA editing. An important example in humans occurs with the transcript for apolipoprotein (apo) B, an essential component of chylomicrons (see p. 351) and very-low-density lipoproteins ([VLDL], see p. 353). Apo B mRNA is made in the liver and the small intestine. However, in the intestine only, the cytosine (C) base in the CAA codon for glutamine is enzymatically deaminated to uracil (U), changing the sense codon to the nonsense or stop codon UAA, as shown in \nFigure 38.14 . This results in a shorter protein (apo B-48, repre-\nsenting 48% of the message) being made in the intestine (and incor-porated into chylomicrons) than is made in the liver (apo B-100, full-length, incorporated into VLDL).\n 4. Messenger RNA stability:  How long an mRNA remains in the \ncytosol before it is degraded influences how much protein product can be produced from it. Regulation of iron metabolism and the gene-silencing process of RNA interference (RNAi) illustrate the importance of mRNA stability in the regulation of gene expression.\n a. Iron metabolism:  Transferrin (Tf) is a plasma protein that trans-\nports iron. Tf binds to cell-surface receptors (transferrin recep-tors [TfR]) that get internalized and provide cells, such as erythroblasts, with iron. The mRNA for the TfR has several cis-acting iron-responsive elements (IRE) in its 3 \u2032-UTR. IRE have \na short stem-loop structure that can be bound by trans-acting iron regulatory proteins (IRP), as shown in \nFigure 38.15 . When \nthe iron concentration in the cell is low, the IRP bind to the 3\u2032-IRE and stabilize the mRNA for TfR, allowing TfR synthesis. \nWhen intracellular iron levels are high, the IRP dissociate. The lack of IRP bound to the mRNA hastens its destruction, resulting in decreased TfR synthesis. [Note: The mRNA for ferritin, an intracellular protein of iron storage, has a single IRE in its 5 \u2032-UTR. When iron levels in the cell are low, IRP bind the \n5\u2032-IRE and prevent the use of the mRNA, and less ferritin is \nmade. When iron accumulates in the cell, the IRP dissociate, allowing synthesis of ferritin molecules to store the excess iron.

RNA interference:  RNAi is a mechanism of gene silencing \nthrough decreased expression of mRNA, either by repression of translation or by increased degradation. It plays a key role in such fundamental processes as cell proliferation, differenti-ation, and apoptosis. RNAi is mediated by short (~22 nucleo-tides), noncoding RNA called microRNA (miRNA). The miRNA arise from far longer, genomically encoded nuclear transcripts, primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), that are partially processed in the nucleus to pre-miRNA by an endonuclease  (Drosha ) then \ntransported to the cytoplasm. There, an endonuclease  (Dicer ) \ncompletes the processing and generates short, double-stranded miRNA. A single strand (the guide or antisense strand) of the miRNA associates with a cytosolic protein complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The guide strand hybridizes with a complementary sequence in the 3 \u2032-UTR of a \nfull-length target mRNA, bringing RISC to the mRNA. This can result in repression of translation of the mRNA or its degradation by an endonucleas e (Argonaute/Ago/Slicer ) of the RISC. The \nextent of complementarity appears to be the determining factor (\nFig. 38.16 ). RNAi can also be triggered by the introduction of \nexogenous double-stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) into a cell, a process that has enormous therapeutic potential.\ni. RNA interference\u2013based therapeutics:  The first clinical \ntrial of RNAi-based therapy involved the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is triggered by overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to the sprouting of excess blood vessels behind the retina. The vessels leak, clouding and often entirely destroying vision (therefore, neovascular AMD is also referred to as wet AMD).

The research applications of RNAi, however, have grown rapidly.\n 5. Messenger RNA translation:  Regulation of gene expression can \nalso occur at the level of mRNA translation. One mechanism by which translation is regulated is through phosphorylation of the eukary-otic translation initiation factor, eIF-2 (\nFig. 38.17 ). Phosphorylation \nof eIF-2 inhibits its function and so inhibits translation at the initi-ation step (see p. 642). [Note: Phosphorylation of eIF-2 prevents its reactivation by inhibiting GDP-GTP exchange.] Phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases  that are activated in response to environ-\nmental conditions, such as amino acid starvation, heme deficiency in erythroblasts, the presence of double-stranded RNA (signaling viral infection), and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (see p. 646).\nC. Regulation through variations in DNA\nGene expression in eukaryotes is also influenced by the accessibility of DNA to the transcriptional apparatus, the amount of DNA, and the arrangement of DNA. [Note: Localized transitions between the B and Z forms of DNA (see p. 594) can also affect gene expression.]\n 1. Access to DNA:  In eukaryotes, DNA is found complexed with \nhistone and nonhistone proteins to form chromatin (see p. 604). Transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin (euchromatin) differs from the more condensed, inactive form (heterochromatin) in a number of ways. Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 621 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyl-\ntransferase  and histone deacetylase ). Such modifications decrease \nthe positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the strength of their association with negatively charged DNA. This relaxes the nucleosome (see p. 604), allowing transcription factors access to specific regions on the DNA. Nucleosomes can also be repositioned, an ATP-requiring process that is part of chromatin remodeling. Another difference between transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin is the extent of methylation of cytosine bases in CG-rich regions (CpG islands) in the promoter region of many genes. Methylation is by methyltransferases  that use S-adenosylmethionine \nas the methyl donor (\nFig. 38.18 ). Transcriptionally active genes are \nless methylated (hypomethylated) than their inactive counterparts, suggesting that DNA hypermethylation silences gene expression. Modification of histones and methylation of DNA are epigenetic in that they are heritable changes in DNA that alter gene expression without altering the base sequence.\n 2. Amount of DNA:  A change up or down in the number of copies of a \ngene can affect the amount of gene product produced. An increase in copy number (gene amplification)  has contributed to increased \ngenomic complexity and is still a normal developmental process, e.g., ribosomal protein genes amplify as a  new cell is being made. Gene amplification is also seen in some diseases and in response to Figure 38.17\nRegulation of translation initiation in \neukaryotes by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2.

TTP is essential for DNA synthesis. Gene amplification results in an increase in the number of DHFR  \ngenes and resistance to the drug, allowing TTP to be made.\n 3. Arrangement of DNA:  The process by which immunoglobulins \n(antibodies) are produced by B lymphocytes involves permanent rearrangements of the DNA in these cells. The immunoglobulins (for example, IgG) consist of two light and two heavy chains, with each chain containing regions of variable and constant amino acid sequence. The variable region is the result of somatic recombina-tion of segments within both the light- and the heavy-chain genes. During B-lymphocyte development, single variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are brought together through gene rearrangement to form a unique variable region (\nFig. 38.19 ). This \nprocess allows the generation of 109\u22121011 different immunoglobu-\nlins from a single gene, providing the diversity needed for the recog-nition of an enormous number of antigens. [Note: Pathologic DNA rearrangement is seen with translocation, a process by which two different chromosomes exchange DNA segments.]\n 4. Mobile DNA elements:  Transposons (Tn) are mobile segments of \nDNA that move in an essentially random manner from one site to another on the same or a different chromosome. Movement is medi-ated by transposase , an enzyme encoded by the Tn itself. Movement \ncan be direct, in which transposase  cuts out and then inserts the Tn \nat a new site, or replicative, in which the Tn is copied and the copy inserted elsewhere while the original remains in place. In eukary-otes, including humans, replicative transposition frequently involves an RNA intermediate made by a reverse transcriptase  (see p. 603), \nNote: The immunoglobulin genes are comprised of numerous \ndiscontinuous segments in the DNA.As B cells develop, these DNA segments are chosen and joint together such that each mature B cell and plasma cell has a unique rearrangement profile for a unique antibodyDNA\ngermline\nRe-arranged DNA\nmRNA\nAntibody\nAntigen binding\nsiteV\nVL CLJ C\nFigure 38.19\nImmunoglobulin gene rearrangement in antibody-producing cell.SAMSAHN\nN\nCytosineH ONH2\nMethyltransferaseN\nN\n5-MethylcytosineH ONH2\nCH3\nFigure 38.18\nThe methylation of cytosine in eukaryotic \nDNA.

Transposition \nhas contributed to structural variation in the genome but also has the potential to alter gene expression and even to cause disease. Tn comprise ~50% of the human genome, with retrotransposons accounting for 90% of Tn. Although the vast majority of these retrotransposons have lost the ability to move, some are still active. Their transposition is thought to be the basis for some rare cases of hemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. [Note: The growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a consequence, at least in part, of the exchange of plasmids among bacterial cells. If the plas-mids contain Tn-carrying antibiotic resistance genes, the recipient bacteria gain resistance to one or more antimicrobial drugs.]\nAdditional interesting features about eukaryotic gene expression\nIn eukaryotes, there can be further binding of multiple proteins which lead to extra DNA bends and approx-\nimations that exponentially increase rate of transcription. This formation of enhanceosomes  helps the \neukaryotes to deal with an urgent and excessive need like increased transcription of human beta interferon gene in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \nLocus control regions (LCRs)  are segments of DNA that controls gene clusters which may be near or far \napart from each other (but on the same chromosome). This control is a level above regulated expression of genes and may be related to chromatin structure. For example, an LCR controls expression of globin gene family over a large region of DNA. Insulators  are segments of DNA beyond which the influence of LCR will \nnot extend. \nGene switching  is a phenomenon in which transcription and translation of a given gene stops and a related \none is turned on. This is seen in development of hemoglobin from embryonic to adult life and in immuno-globin response to an antigen (Chapter 43). \nEukaryotes have tissues and therefore their differentiation requires some specific processes. Tissue-\nspecific expression  implies the production of particular products in particular tissues only, e.g., produc-\ntion of insulin from pancreas and immunoglobulins from B-lymphocytes. Some ways in which tissue-specific expression can be achieved include enhancer or enhancer-like elements which can act in a tissue-specific manner to regulate gene expression. \nGenomic imprinting  is the inheritance of some genes in a silent state from one parent (imprinted by methyl-\nation which inhibits its expression), while the other parental gene is expressed. Further, eukaryotes also have the ability of an SOS response  which is the coordinated regulation of unrelated genes having a common \ngoal. For example, when there is severe DNA damage, the common goal of limiting damage and preventing transmission to daughter cells leads to coordination of DNA-repairing genes and cell division repression genes. Gene loss  may also occur in eukaryotes. It is the loss of genetic material from cells, e.g., RBC which \nare without nucleus. \nThe meiotically and mitotically heritable changes in gene expression which are not coded for in the DNA, \nare another challenge in understanding eukaryote gene expression. These epigenetic modifications  have \nbeen targeted in drug therapies.\nGene silencing  is also one of the epigenetic process of gene regulation. It is the switching off a gene by \nmechanisms other than genetic modifications. Common ways are transcriptional gene silencing by histone modifications, DNA methylations and silencing by interfering RNA. This can be developmental as a part of tissue-specific expression and could also be a protection against transposons or viruses.\nV. Medical Perspectives\nA resistance to methotrexate (MTX), an anticancer drug is often seen in patients receiving MTX for a long time. This is because of gene amplification  of dihydrofolate reductase  (DHFR) gene leading to increased number of DHFR genes, \ncausing increased production of DHFR . Therefore, the clinician often needs to increase dosage of MTX in such patients \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   669 24-10-2020   12:13:38"

This is achieved \nby gene switching . Embryonic hemoglobin has two alpha and two epsilon chains. This is replaced by fetal Hb at \n6 months of life which has two alpha and two gamma chains. After birth, two alpha and two beta chains (HbA1) or two alpha and two delta chains are synthesized (HbA2). Defects in gene switching can give rise to severe hemoglobinopathies.\nGene switching is also responsible for class switching of immunoglobulins during transition from primary to secondary \nimmune response. During primary response IgM is produced, but in secondary response IgG with same antigen speci-ficity is synthesized. \nTherefore, to assess a recent infection, IgM antibodies are tested, and IgG antibodies are tested to assess an infection \nwhich happened some time ago.\nThe inhibition of specific epigenetic enzymes can reverse the incorporation of an epigenetic mutation making these \nenzymes attractive targets for cancer therapy. Drugs which inhibit DNA dimethyltransferase 1 (Azacytidine and Decitabine) \nare approved for treatment of adult myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myeldysplastic syndrome (MDS). Veronistat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and its sister syndrome, Angelman syndrome (AS), are classical examples of genomic \nimprinting in humans. Both syndromes are associated with defects in chromosome 15. Paternal inheritance of a deletion of this region is associated with PWS (characterized by hypotonia, obesity, and hypogonadism), while maternal inher-itance of the same deletion is associated with AS (characterized by epilepsy, tremors, and a perpetually smiling facial expression).\nVI. Chapter Summary\nGene expression  results in the production of a functional gene product (either RNA or protein) through the processes of \ntranscription and translation ( Fig. 38.20 ). Genes  can be either constitutive  (always expressed, housekeeping genes) or \nregulated  (expressed only under certain conditions in all cells or in a subset of cells). The ability to appropriately induce  \n(positively regulate ) or repress  (negatively regulate ) genes is essential in all organisms. Regulation of gene expression \noccurs primarily at transcription  in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is mediated through trans-acting proteins  \nbinding to cis-acting regulatory DNA elements . In eukaryotes , regulation also occurs through DNA modifications  and \nthrough posttranscriptional  and posttranslational processing . In prokaryotes , such as Escherichia coli, the coordinate \nregulation of genes whose protein products are required for a particular process is achieved through operons  (groups of \ngenes sequentially arranged on the chromosome along with the regulatory elements that determine their transcription). The lac operon  contains the Z, Y , and A structural genes, the protein products of which are needed for the catabolism of \nlactose. It is subject to negative and positive regulation. When glucose  is available, the operon is repressed by the binding \nof the repressor protein  (the product of the lacI gene) to the operator , thus preventing transcription. When only lactose  \nis present, the operon is induced by an isomer of lactose ( allolactose ) that binds the repressor protein, preventing it from \nbinding to the operator. In addition, cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP ) binds the catabolite activator protein  \n(CAP ), and the complex binds the DNA at the CAP site . This increases promoter  efficiency and results in the expression \nof the structural genes through the production of a polycistronic messenger RNA  (mRNA ). When both glucose and \nlactose  are present, glucose prevents formation of cAMP , and transcription of these genes is negligible. The trp operon  \ncontains genes needed for the synthesis of tryptophan (Trp), and, like the lac operon, it is regulated by negative control . \nUnlike the lac operon, it is also regulated by attenuation , in which mRNA synthesis that escaped repression by Trp is \nterminated before completion. Transcription of ribosomal RNA  and transfer RNA  is selectively inhibited in prokaryotes \nby the stringent response  to amino acid starvation. Translation  is also a site of prokaryotic gene regulation: Excess ribo-\nsomal proteins bind the Shine-Dalgarno sequence  on their own polycistronic mRNA, preventing ribosomes from binding. \nGene regulation is more complex in eukaryotes . Operons are not present, but coordinate regulation of the transcription \nof genes located on different chromosomes can be achieved through the binding of trans-acting proteins to cis-acting \nelements as seen in the galactose circuit  in unicellular yeast. In multicellular organisms, hormones  can cause coordi-\nnated regulation, either through the binding of the hormone receptor \u2013hormone complex  to the DNA (as with steroid \nhormones) or through the binding of a protein that is activated in response to a second messenger  (as with glucagon). \nIn each case, binding to DNA is mediated through structural motifs such as the zinc finger . Co- and posttranscriptional \nregulation  is also seen in eukaryotes and includes alternative mRNA splicing  and polyadenylation , mRNA editing , and \nvariations in mRNA stability  as seen with transferrin receptor  synthesis and with RNA interference . Regulation at the \ntranslational level  can be caused by the phosphorylation  and inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 . Gene expres-\nsion in eukaryotes is also influenced by accessibility  of DNA to the transcriptional apparatus (as seen with epigenetic  \nchanges to histone proteins), the amount  of DNA, and the arrangement  of the DNA.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   670 24-10-2020   12:13:39"

In the absence of glucose, adenylyl \ncyclase makes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which forms a complex with the catabolite activator protein (CAP).

With cya\n\u2212 mutations, adenylyl \ncyclase is not made, and so the operon is unable to be maximally expressed even when glucose is absent and lactose is present.

The human genome contains ~3 billion (10\n9) base pairs \n(bp) that encode 20,000\u201325,000 protein-coding genes located on 23 chro-mosomes in the haploid genome. It is now possible to determine the nucle-otide sequence of long stretches of DNA, and the entire human genome has been sequenced. This effort (called the Human Genome Project and completed in 2003) was made possible by several tools that have already contributed to our understanding of many genetic diseases (\nFig. 39.1 ). \nThese include 1) the discovery of restriction endonucleases  that permit \nthe cleavage of huge DNA molecules into defined fragments, 2) the devel-opment of cloning techniques that provide a mechanism for amplification of specific nucleotide sequences, and 3) the ability to synthesize specific probes, which has allowed the identification and manipulation of nucle-otide sequences of interest. These and other experimental approaches have permitted the identification of both normal and mutant nucleotide sequences in DNA. This knowledge has led to the development of methods for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and some successes in the treat-ment of patients by gene therapy. [Note: The genomes of several viruses, prokaryotes, and nonhuman eukaryotes have also been sequenced.]\nII. RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES\nOne of the major obstacles to molecular analysis of genomic DNA is the immense size of the molecules involved. The discovery of a special group of bacterial enzymes, called restriction endonucleases  (restriction \nenzymes), which cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into smaller, more manageable fragments, opened the way for DNA analysis.

            "Text": "II. Restriction Endonucleases 675\nrestriction enzymes are used experimentally to obtain precisely defined \nDNA segments called restriction fragments.\nA. Specificity\nRestriction endonucleases  recognize short stretches of dsDNA (4\u20138 bp) \nthat contain specific nucleotide sequences. These sequences, which differ for each restriction enzyme, are palindromes, that is, they exhibit twofold rotational symmetry (\nFig. 39.2 ). This means that, within a short \nregion of the dsDNA, the nucleotide sequence on the two strands is identical if each is read in the 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032 direction. Therefore, if you turn the \npage upside down (that is, rotate it 180 \u00b0 around its axis of symmetry) \nthe sequence remains the same.\nIn bacteria, restriction endonucleases  limit (restrict) the \nexpression of nonbacterial (foreign) DNA through cleavage. Bacterial DNA is protected from cleavage by methylation of adenine at the restriction site.\nB. Nomenclature\nA restriction enzyme is named according to the organism from which \nit was isolated. The first letter of the name is from the genus of the bacterium. The next two letters are from the name of the species. An additional letter indicates the type or strain (as needed), and a number (Roman numeral) is appended to indicate the order in which the enzyme was discovered in that particular organism. For example, HaeIII is the \nthird restriction endonuclease  isolated from the bacterium Haemophilus \naegyptius.\nC. Sticky and blunt ends\nRestriction enzymes cleave dsDNA so as to produce a 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group \non one end and a 5 \u2032-phosphate group on the other. Some restriction \nendonucleases , such as TaqI, form staggered cuts that produce sticky \nor cohesive ends (that is, the resulting DNA fragments have single-stranded regions that are complementary to each other), as shown in \nFigure 39.3 . Other restriction endonucleases , such as HaeIII, produce \nfragments that have blunt ends that are entirely double stranded and, therefore, do not form hydrogen bonds with each other. Using the enzyme DNA ligase  (see p. 597), sticky ends of a DNA fragment of \ninterest can be covalently joined with other DNA fragments that have sticky ends produced by cleavage with the same restriction endonu-\nclease  (\nFig. 39.4 ). [Note: A ligase  encoded by bacteriophage T4 can \ncovalently join blunt-ended fragments.]\nD. Restriction sites\nA DNA sequence that is recognized and cut by a restriction enzyme is called a restriction site. Restriction endonucleases  cleave dsDNA into \nfragments of different sizes depending upon the size of the sequence recognized. For example, an enzyme that recognizes a specific 4-bp sequence produces many cuts in the DNA molecule, one every 4\n4 bp. \nIn contrast, an enzyme requiring a unique sequence of 6 bp produces fewer cuts (one every 4\n6 bp) and, therefore, longer pieces.

Biotechnology and Human Disease\nof these enzymes, each having different cleavage specificities (varying \nin both nucleotide sequences and length of recognition sites), are commercially available.\nIII. DNA CLONING\nIntroduction of a foreign DNA molecule into a replicating cell permits the cloning or, amplification (that is, the production of many identical copies) of that DNA. [Note: Human DNA for cloning can be obtained from blood, saliva, and solid tissue.] In some cases, a single DNA fragment can be isolated and purified prior to cloning. More commonly, to clone a nucleotide sequence of interest, the total cellular DNA is first cleaved with a specific restriction enzyme, creating hundreds of thousands of fragments. Each of the resulting DNA fragments is joined to a DNA vector molecule (referred to as a cloning vector) to form a hybrid, or recombinant, DNA molecule. Each recombinant molecule carries its inserted DNA fragment into a single host cell (for example, a bacterium), where it is replicated. [Note: The process of introducing foreign DNA into a cell is called transformation for bacteria and yeast and transfection for higher eukaryotes.] As the host cell multi-plies, it forms a clone in which every bacterium contains copies of the same inserted DNA fragment, hence the name \u201ccloning.\u201d The cloned DNA can be released from its vector by cleavage (using the appropriate restric-\ntion endonuclease ) and isolated. By this mechanism, many identical copies \nof the DNA of interest can be produced. [Note: An alternative to amplifica-tion by biologic cloning, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is described on p. 687.]\nA. Vectors\nA vector is a molecule of DNA to which the fragment of DNA to be cloned is joined. Essential properties of a vector include the 1) capacity for autonomous replication within a host cell, 2) presence of at least one specific nucleotide sequence recognized by a restriction endonuclease , \nand 3) presence of at least one gene (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) that confers the ability to select for the vector. Commonly used vectors include plasmids and viruses.\n 1. Prokaryotic plasmids:  Prokaryotic organisms typically contain \nsingle, large, circular chromosomes. In addition, most species of bacteria also normally contain small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids (\nFig. 39.5 ). Plasmid DNA undergoes \nreplication that may or may not be synchronized to chromosomal division. Plasmids may carry genes that convey antibiotic resistance to the host bacterium and may facilitate the transfer of genetic infor-mation from one bacterium to another. They can be readily isolated from bacterial cells, their circular DNA cleaved at specific sites by restriction endonucleases , and up to 15 kb (kilobases) of foreign \nDNA (cut with the same restriction enzyme) inserted. The recombi-nant plasmid vector can be introduced into a bacterium, producing large numbers of copies of the plasmid. The bacteria are grown in the presence of antibiotics, thus selecting for cells containing the hybrid plasmids, which provide antibiotic resistance (\nFig. 39.6 ). \nArtificial plasmids are routinely constructed. An example is the classic pBR322 (see \nFig. 39.5 ), which contains an origin of repli-\ncation, two antibiotic resistance genes, and >40 unique restriction T\nAGC\nCGA\nTCGT\nA GC\nCG\nGC\nCGA\nT\nDNA ligaseT\nAGC GC\nCGA\nTCGA\nTCGT\nA CG\nGC\nA\nT CGT\nA CG\nGC\nT\n CCCCCCCC\nGGGGGGG\nAAA\nG\nT\n C\n C\n G\nA\nT\nC\nA\nT\n C\nG\nT\nA\n C\nG\nG\nC\nDNA of interest with a sticky\nend produced  by TaqI.\nDNA ligase forms a 3 \u02b9\u00c65\u02b9-phospho-\ndiester bond between the fragments.\nA\nG\nC\n TTT\nC\nA\n G\n C\nG\nG\n C\nT\nA\nG\nCCCCCC\nC\nG\nA\nTTT\nC\nG\nT\nA\n G\nC\nG\nC\nC\nG\nSecond fragment of DNA also \nwith a sticky end produced bycleavage with TaqI.       \nDNA  ligase\nA\nG\nC\n G\nC\nT\n T\nT\nT\nC\nA\n C\n G\nCohesive ends of two DNA \nfragments form hydrogen bonds.DNA of interest Second DNA fragment \nCleavage by TaqI\nFigure 39.4\nFormation of recombinant DNA from \nrestriction fragments with sticky ends.

Other vectors:  The development of improved vectors that can \nmore efficiently accommodate larger DNA segments, or express the passenger genes in different cell types, has aided molecular genetics research and therapeutics. In addition to the prokaryotic plasmids described above, naturally occurring viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage \u03bb, for example) or mammalian cells (retrovi-\nruses, for example), as well as artificial constructs such as cosmids and bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes (BAC or YAC, respec-tively), are currently used as cloning vectors.

The expression vector should have the transcriptional and translational machinery. The protein should be coded by the gene introduced in the vector by recombinant DNA technology. \nB. DNA libraries\nA DNA library is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism. Two kinds of libraries are commonly used: genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries. Genomic libraries ideally contain a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome. In contrast, cDNA libraries contain those DNA sequences that only appear as processed messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, and these differ according to cell type and environmental conditions. [Note: cDNA lacks introns and the control regions of the genes, whereas these are present in genomic DNA.]\n 1. Genomic DNA libraries:  A genomic library is created by digestion \nof the total DNA of an organism with a restriction endonuclease  \nand subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. The recombi-nant DNA molecules replicate within host bacteria. Thus, the ampli-fied DNA fragments collectively represent the entire genome of the organism and are called a genomic library. Regardless of the restric-tion enzyme used, the chances are good that the gene of interest contains more than one restriction site recognized by that enzyme. If this is the case, and if the digestion is allowed to go to completion, the gene of interest is fragmented (that is, it is not contained in any one clone in the library). To avoid this usually undesirable result, a partial digestion is performed in which either the amount or the time of action of the enzyme is limited. This results in cleavage occur-ring at only a fraction of the restriction sites on any one DNA mole-cule, thus producing fragments of ~20 kb. Enzymes that cut very frequently (that is, those that recognize 4-bp sequences) are gener-ally used for this purpose so that the result is an almost random collection of fragments. This insures a high degree of probability that the gene of interest is contained, intact, in some fragment.\n 2. Complementary DNA libraries:  If a protein-coding gene of interest \nis expressed at a high level in a particular tissue, the mRNA tran-scribed from that gene is likely also present at high concentra-tions in the cells of that tissue. For example, reticulocyte mRNA is composed largely of molecules that code for the \u03b1-globin and \n\u03b2-globin chains of hemoglobin A (HbA). This mRNA can be used \nas a template to make a cDNA molecule using the enzyme reverse \ntranscriptase  (\nFig. 39.7 ). Therefore, the resulting cDNA is a double-\nstranded copy of mRNA. [Note: The template mRNA is isolated from transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by the presence of its poly-A tail.] cDNA can be amplified by biologic cloning or by PCR. It can be used as a probe to locate the gene that encodes the original mRNA (or fragments of the gene) in mixtures containing many unrelated DNA fragments. If the mRNA used as a template is a mixture of many different size species, the resulting cDNA is heterogeneous. These mixtures can be cloned to form a cDNA library. Because cDNA has no introns, it can be cloned into an expression vector for the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins by bacteria (\nFig. 39.8 ).

The cDNA is inserted downstream of the promoter and within a gene for a protein that is expressed in the bacterium (for example, lacZ; see p. 659), such that the mRNA produced contains an SD sequence, a few codons for the bacterial protein, and all the codons for the eukaryotic protein. This allows for more efficient expression and results in the production of a fusion protein. [Note: Therapeutic human insulin is made in bacteria through this technology. However, the extensive co- and posttranslational modi-fications required for most other human proteins (for example, blood clotting factors) necessitates the use of eukaryotic, even mamma-lian, hosts.]\nC. Sequencing cloned DNA fragments\nThe base sequence of DNA fragments that have been cloned can be determined. The original procedure for this purpose was the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method illustrated in \nFigure 39.9 . In this \nmethod, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to be sequenced is used as the template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase  (DNA pol ). A \nradiolabeled primer complementary to the 3 \u2032-end of the target DNA is \nadded, along with the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP). The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube. Because it contains no 3 \u2032-hydroxyl group, incorporation of \na ddNMP terminates elongation at that point. The products of this reac-tion, then, consist of a mixture of DNA strands of different lengths, each terminating at a specific base. Separation of the various DNA products by size in an electric field using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography, yields a pattern of bands from which the DNA base sequence can be read. [Note: The shorter the fragment, the farther it travels on the gel, with the shortest fragment representing that which was made first (that is, the 5 \u2032-end).] In place of a labeled primer, \na mixture of the four ddNTP linked to different fluorescent dyes and in a single reaction tube is now commonly used. The mixture is separated by capillary electrophoresis, the fluorescent labels are detected, and a color readout of the sequence is generated (\nFig. 39.10 ). [Note: The \nHuman Genome Project used variations of this technique to sequence the human genome.] Advances in sequencing technology, so-called next generation, or high-throughput sequencing, now allow the rapid sequencing of an entire genome with increased fidelity and decreased cost through the simultaneous (parallel) sequencing of many DNA pieces. [Note: Sequencing of the exome, that portion of the genome that encodes proteins, is now possible.]\nIV. PROBES\nCleavage of large DNA molecules by restriction enzymes produces an enormous array of fragments. How can the DNA sequence of interest be picked out of such a mixture? The answer lies in the use of a probe, a short piece of ssDNA or RNA, labeled with a radioisotope, such as \n32P , or with a \nnonradioactive molecule, such as biotin or a fluorescent dye. The sequence of a probe is complementary to a sequence in the DNA of interest, called the target DNA. Probes are used to identify which band on a gel or which clone in a library contains the target DNA, a process called screening.Fusion protein productBacterial\npromoter Bacterial gene\nCloned \ncDNA\nBacterial transcription and translation\n\u2014C N\u2014\nFigure 39.8\nAn expression vector.

            "Text": "680 39. Biotechnology and Human Disease\nA. Hybridization to DNA\nThe utility of probes hinges on the process of hybridization (or \nannealing) in which a probe containing a complementary sequence binds a single-stranded sequence of a target DNA. ssDNA, produced by alkaline denaturation of dsDNA, is first bound to a solid support, such as a nitrocellulose membrane. The immobilized DNA strands are prevented from self-annealing but are available for hybridization to the exogenous, radiolabeled, single-stranded probe. The extent of hybrid-ization is measured by the retention of radioactivity on the membrane. Excess probe molecules that do not hybridize are removed by washing the membrane.\nB. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes\nIf the sequence of all or part of the target DNA is known, short, single-stranded oligonucleotide probes can be synthesized that are comple-mentary to a small region of the gene of interest. If the sequence of the gene is unknown, the amino acid sequence of the protein, the final gene product, may be used to construct a nucleic acid probe using the genetic code as a guide. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code (see p. 635), it is necessary to synthesize several oligonucleotides. [Note: Oligonucleotides can be used to detect single-base changes in the sequence to which they are complementary. In contrast, cDNA probes contain many thousands of bases, and their binding to a target DNA with a single-base change is unaffected.]\n 1. Detecting the \ud835\udec3\nS-globin mutation:  A synthetic allele-specific oligo-\nnucleotide (ASO) probe can be used to detect the presence of the sickle cell mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene (\nFig. 39.11 ). DNA, isolated \nfrom white blood cells (WBC) and amplified, is denatured and applied to a membrane. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, complemen-tary to the point mutation (GAG \u2192 GTG, glutamate \u2192 valine) at \ncodon 6 in patients with the \u03b2\nS gene, is applied to the membrane. \nDNA isolated from a heterozygous individual (sickle cell trait) or a homozygous patient (sickle cell anemia) contains a sequence that is complementary to the probe and a double-stranded hybrid form can be detected. In contrast, DNA obtained from normal individuals is not complementary at this position and, therefore, does not form a hybrid (see \nFig. 39.11 ). Use of a pair of such ASO probes (one \nspecific for the normal allele and one specific for the mutant allele) allows all three possible genotypes (homozygous normal, hetero-zygous, and homozygous mutant) to be distinguished (\nFig. 39.12 ). \n[Note: ASO probes are useful only if the mutation and its location are known.]\nC. Biotinylated probes\nBecause the disposal of radioactive waste is becoming increasingly expensive, nonradiolabeled probes have been developed. One of the most successful is based on the vitamin biotin (see p. 533), which can be chemically linked to the nucleotides used to synthesize the probe. Biotin was chosen because it binds very tenaciously to avidin, a readily available protein contained in chicken egg whites. Avidin can be attached to a fluorescent dye detectable optically with great sensi-tivity. Thus, a DNA fragment (displayed, for example, by gel electropho-resis) that hybridizes with the biotinylated probe can be made visible \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   680 24-10-2020   12:13:45"

If the probe is fluorescent (F), the technique is called FISH.]\nD. Antibodies\nIf no amino acid sequence information is available to guide the synthesis of a probe for direct detection of the DNA of interest, a gene can be identified indirectly by cloning cDNA in an expression vector that allows the cloned cDNA to be transcribed and translated.

[Note: The * indicates \n32P radiolabel.]V. SOUTHERN BLOTTING\nSouthern blotting is a technique that combines the use of restriction \nenzymes, electrophoresis, and DNA probes to generate, separate, and detect pieces of DNA.\nA. Procedure\nThis method, named after its inventor, Edward Southern, involves the following steps (\nFig. 39.13 ). First, DNA is extracted from cells, for \nexample, a patient\u2019s WBC. Second, the DNA is cleaved into many frag-ments using a restriction enzyme. Third, the resulting fragments (all of which are negatively charged) are separated on the basis of size by electrophoresis. [Note: Because the large fragments move more slowly than the smaller ones, the lengths of the fragments, usually expressed as the number of base pairs, can be calculated from comparison of the position of the band relative to standard fragments of known size.] The DNA fragments in the gel are denatured and transferred (blotted) to a nitrocellulose membrane for analysis. If the original DNA repre-sents the individual\u2019s entire genome, the enzymic digest contains \u226510\n6 \nfragments. The gene of interest is on only one (or a few if the gene itself was fragmented) of these pieces of DNA. If all the DNA frag-ments were visualized by a nonspecific technique, they would appear as an unresolved blur of overlapping bands. To avoid this, the last step in Southern blotting uses a probe to identify the DNA fragments of interest. The patterns observed on Southern blot analysis depend both on the specific restriction endonuclease  and on the probe used to visu-\nalize the restriction fragments. [Note: Variants of the Southern blot have been facetiously named northern if RNA is being studied (see p. 692) and western if protein is being studied (see p. 693), neither of which relates to anyone\u2019s name or to points of the compass.]\nB. Mutation detection\nSouthern blotting can detect DNA mutations such as large insertions or deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and rearrangements of nucleotides. It can also detect point mutations (replacement of one nucleotide by another; see p. 635) that cause the loss or gain of restric-tion sites. Such mutations cause the pattern of bands to differ from those seen with a normal gene. Longer fragments are generated if a restriction site is lost. For example, in \nFigure 39.13 , person 2 lacks a \nrestriction site present in person 1. Alternatively, the point mutation may create a new cleavage site with the production of shorter fragments. [Note: Most sequence differences at restriction sites are harmless vari-ations in the DNA.]\nVI.  RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH \nPOLYMORPHISM\nIt has been estimated that the genomes of any two unrelated people are \n99.5% identical. With 6 billion bp in the diploid human genome, that repre-sents variation in ~30 million bp. These genome variations are the result of mutations that lead to polymorphisms. A polymorphism is a change in genotype that can result in no change in phenotype or a change in pheno-type that is harmless, causes increased susceptibility to a disease, or, rarely, \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   682 24-10-2020   12:13:48"

            "Text": "VI. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism 683\ncauses the disease. It is traditionally defined as a sequence variation at a \ngiven locus (allele) in >1% of a population. Polymorphisms primarily occur in the 98% of the genome that does not encode proteins (that is, in introns and intergenic regions). A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) is a genetic variant that can be observed by cleaving the DNA into frag-ments (restriction fragments) with a restriction endonuclease . The length \nof the restriction fragments is altered if the variant alters the DNA so as to create or abolish a restriction site. RFLP can be used to detect human genetic variations, for example, in prospective parents or in fetal tissue.\nA. DNA variations resulting in RFLP\nTwo types of DNA variations commonly result in RFLP: single-base changes in the DNA sequence and tandem repeats of DNA sequences.\n 1. Single-base changes:  About 90% of human genome variation \ncomes in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced \u201csnips\u201d), that is, variations that involve just one base (\nFig. 39.14 ). The substitution of one nucleotide at a restriction site \ncan render the site unrecognizable by a particular restriction endo-\nnuclease . A new restriction site can also be created by the same \nmechanism. In either case, cleavage with an endonuclease  results \nin fragments of lengths that differ from the normal and can be detected by DNA hybridization (see \nFig. 39.13 ). The altered restric-\ntion site can be either at the site of a disease-causing mutation (rare) or at a site some distance from the mutation. [Note: The HapMap, developed by The International Haplotype Map Project, is a catalog of common SNP in the human genome. The data are being used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify those alleles that affect health and disease.]\n 2. Tandem repeats:  Polymorphisms in chromosomal DNA can also \narise from the presence of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), as shown in \nFigure 39.15 . These are short sequences of \nDNA at scattered locations in the genome, repeated in tandem (one after another). The number of these repeat units varies from person to person but is unique for any given individual and, therefore, serves as a molecular \u201cfingerprint.\u201d Cleavage by restriction enzymes yields fragments that vary in length depending on how many repeated segments are contained in the fragment (see \nFig. 39.15 ). Many \ndifferent VNTR loci have been identified and are extremely useful for DNA fingerprint analysis, such as in forensic and paternity cases. It is important to emphasize that these polymorphisms, whether SNP or VNTR, are simply markers, which, in most cases, have no known effect on the structure, function, or rate of production of any partic-ular protein.\nB. Tracing chromosomes from parent to offspring\nIf the DNA of an individual has gained a restriction site by base substi-tution, then enzymic cleavage yields at least one additional fragment. Conversely, if a mutation results in loss of a restriction site, fewer frag-ments are produced by enzymic cleavage. An individual who is hetero-zygous for a polymorphism has a sequence variation in the DNA of one chromosome and not in the homologous chromosome. In such indi-viduals, each chromosome can be traced from parent to offspring by determining the presence or absence of the polymorphism.= Probe hybridizes \n   to patient's DNAHomozygous mutant (affected, SS)Heterozygous (carrier,  AS)Homozygous normal (AA)\nThis row was probed \nwith an ASO specific for a normal b\nA gene.\nThis row was probed \nwith an ASO specific for a mutant b\nS gene.\n= Probe does not \n   hybridize to patient's    DNA\n= Probe hybridi z\n   to patient's D N\nfor a normal \n b\nThis row was\nwith an ASO s\nfor a mutant \nb\n= Probe does n o\n   hybridize to p\n   DN A\nTwo samples of DNA from each individual are appliedto the membrane.\nFigure 39.12\nAllele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) \nprobes used to detect the sickle cell mutation and differentiate between sickle cell trait and disease.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   683 24-10-2020   12:13:48"

Prenatal diagnosis\nFamilies with a history of severe genetic disease, such as an affected \nprevious child or near relative, may wish to determine the presence of the disorder in a developing fetus. Prenatal diagnosis, in association with genetic counseling, allows for an informed reproductive decision if the fetus is affected.\n 1. Methods available:  The available diagnostic methods vary in sensi-\ntivity and specificity. Visualization of the fetus, for example, by ultra-sound or fiberoptic devices (fetoscopy), is useful only if the genetic abnormality results in gross anatomic defects (for example, neural tube defects [NTD]). The chemical composition of the amniotic fluid can also provide diagnostic clues. For example, the presence of high levels of \u03b1-fetoprotein is associated with NTD. Fetal cells \nobtained from amniotic fluid or from biopsy of the chorionic villi can be used for karyotyping, which assesses the morphology of meta-phase chromosomes. Staining and cell sorting techniques permit the rapid identification of trisomies and translocations that produce an extra chromosome or chromosomes of abnormal lengths. However, molecular analysis of fetal DNA provides the most detailed genetic picture.\n 2. DNA sources:  DNA may be obtained from blood cells, amniotic \nfluid, or chorionic villi (\nFig. 39.16 ). For amniotic fluid, it was formerly \nnecessary to grow cells in culture for 2\u20133 weeks in order to have sufficient DNA for analysis. The ability to amplify DNA by PCR has dramatically shortened the time needed for a DNA analysis.\n 3. Direct diagnosis of sickle cell anemia using RFLP:  The genetic \ndisorders of Hb are the most common genetic diseases in humans. In the case of sickle cell anemia (\nFig. 39.17 ), the point mutation \nthat gives rise to the disease (see p. 112) is actually one and the same mutation that gives rise to the polymorphism. However, direct detection by RFLP of diseases that result from point mutations is limited to only a few genetic diseases.\n a. Early diagnostic efforts:  In the past, prenatal diagnosis of \nsickle cell anemia involved the determination of the amount and kinds of Hb synthesized in the nucleated red cells obtained from fetal blood. However, the invasive procedures to obtain fetal blood have a high mortality rate (~5%), and analysis cannot be carried out until late in the second trimester of pregnancy when HbA (and its HbS variant) begins to be produced.\n b. RFLP analysis:  In sickle cell anemia, the sequence alteration \ncaused by the point mutation abolishes the recognition site of the restriction endonuclease Mst II: CCTNAGG (where N is \nany nucleotide; see \nFig. 39.17 ). Thus, the A-to-T mutation in \ncodon 6 of the \u03b2S-globin gene eliminates a cleavage site for \nthe enzyme. Normal DNA digested with MstII yields a 1.15-kb \nfragment, whereas a 1.35-kb fragment is generated from the \u03b2S \ngene as a result of the loss of one MstII cleavage site.

Biotechnology and Human Disease\ntechniques that allow analysis of fetal DNA from amniotic cells \nor chorionic villus sampling rather than fetal blood have proved valuable because they provide safe, early detection of sickle cell anemia as well as other genetic diseases. [Note: Genetic disor-ders caused by insertions or deletions between two restriction sites, rather than by the creation or loss of cleavage sites, will also display RFLP .]\n 4. Indirect diagnosis of phenylketonuria using RFLP:  The gene for \nphenylalanine hydroxylase  (PAH), the enzyme deficient in phenyl-\nketonuria ([PKU], see p. 404), is located on chromosome 12. It spans ~90 kb of genomic DNA and contains 13 exons separated by introns (\nFig. 39.18 ; see p. 625 for a description of exons and \nintrons). Mutations in the PAH gene usually do not directly affect \nany restriction endonuclease  recognition site. To establish a diag-\nnostic protocol for PKU, DNA from family members of the affected individual must be analyzed. The goal is to identify genetic markers (RFLP) that are tightly linked to the disease trait. Once these markers are identified, RFLP analysis can be used to carry out prenatal diagnosis.\n a. Mutant gene identification:  Determining the presence of the \nmutant gene by identifying the polymorphism marker can be done if two conditions are satisfied. First, if the polymorphism is closely linked to a disease-producing mutation, the defec-tive gene can be traced by detection of the RFLP . For example, if DNA from a family carrying a disease-causing gene is exam-ined by restriction enzyme cleavage and Southern blotting, it is sometimes possible to find an RFLP that is consistently asso-ciated with that gene (that is, they show close linkage and are coinherited). It is then possible to trace the inheritance of the gene within a family without knowledge of the nature of the genetic defect or its precise location in the genome. [Note: The polymorphism may be known from the study of other families with the disorder or may be discovered to be unique in the family under investigation.] Second, for autosomal-recessive disor-ders, such as PKU, the presence of an affected individual in the family would aid in the diagnosis. This individual would have the mutation present on both chromosomes, allowing identification of the RFLP associated with the genetic disorder.Restriction sites\nRestriction fragments \n(Person 1)\nRestriction fragments \n(Person 2)Restriction sitesAllele \"b\" Allele \"b\"Allele \"a\"PERSON 1 PERSON 2\nAllele \"a\"\n Allele \"a\"\nN 1\n PE\nAllele \"\nVNTR sequences tend to occur in clusters, with\nthe number of repeats varying between individuals.\ns\nRestriction enzymes cut the\nDNA on either side of these tandem repeat sites. \nElectrophoresis of products \nwith fra gments identified by probes\nPattern of fragments varies from one \nperson to another according to where and how many repeated units of the VNTR are located in their genomes.  = GC = \u2013AGCT\u2013\nPerson\n1Person\n2\nFigure 39.15\nRestriction fragment length \npolymorphism of variable number tandem repeats (VNTR).

RFLP analysis:  The presence of abnormal genes for PAH can \nbe shown using DNA polymorphisms as markers to distinguish between normal and mutant genes. For example, \nFigure 39.19 \nshows a typical pattern obtained when DNA from members of an affected family is cleaved with an appropriate restriction enzyme and subjected to electrophoresis. The vertical arrows represent the cleavage sites for the restriction enzyme used. The presence of a polymorphic site creates fragment \u201cb\u201d in the auto-radiogram (after hybridization with a labeled PAH-cDNA probe), \nwhereas the absence of this site yields only fragment \u201ca.\u201d Note that subject II-2 demonstrates that the polymorphism, as shown by the presence of fragment \u201cb,\u201d is associated with the mutant gene. Therefore, in this particular family, the appearance of frag-ment \u201cb\u201d corresponds to the presence of a polymorphic site that marks the abnormal gene for PAH. The absence of fragment \u201cb\u201d \ncorresponds to having only the normal gene. In \nFigure 39.19 , \nexamination of fetal DNA shows that the fetus inherited two abnormal genes from the parents and, therefore, has PKU.\n c. Value of DNA testing:  DNA-based testing is useful not only \nin determining if an unborn fetus is affected by PKU but also in detecting unaffected carriers of the mutated gene to aid in family planning. [Note: PKU is treatable by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in preventing severe neurologic damage in affected individuals.]\nVII. POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION\nPCR is an in vitro method for amplifying a selected DNA sequence that does not rely on the biologic (in vivo) cloning method described on p. 676. PCR permits the synthesis of millions of copies of a specific nucleotide sequence in a few hours. It can amplify the sequence, even when the targeted sequence makes up less than one part in a million of the total initial sample. The method can be used to amplify DNA sequences from any source, including viral, bacterial, plant, or animal. The steps in PCR are summarized in \nFigures 39.20  and 39.21 .\nA. Procedure\nPCR uses DNA pol  to repetitively amplify targeted portions of genomic \nor cDNA. Each cycle of amplification doubles the amount of DNA in the sample, leading to an exponential increase (2\nn, where n = cycle \nnumber) in DNA with repeated cycles of amplification. The amplified DNA products can then be separated by gel electrophoresis, detected by Southern blotting and hybridization, and sequenced.\n 1. Constructing primer:  It is not necessary to know the nucleo-\ntide sequence of the target DNA in the PCR method. However, it is necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of short segments on each side of the target DNA. These stretches, called flanking sequences, bracket the DNA sequence of interest. The nucleo-tide sequences of the flanking regions are used to construct two, single-stranded oligonucleotides, usually 20\u201335 nucleotides long, which are complementary to the respective flanking sequences.

Denaturing DNA:  The target DNA to be amplified is heated to \n~95\u00b0C to separate the dsDNA into single strands.\n 3. Annealing primers:  The separated strands are cooled to ~50 \u00b0C \nand the two primers (one for each strand) anneal to a complemen-tary sequence on the ssDNA.\n 4. Extending primers:  DNA pol  and dNTP (in excess) are added to the \nmixture (~72 \u00b0C) to initiate the synthesis of two new strands comple-\nmentary to the original DNA strands. DNA pol  adds nucleotides to \nthe 3 \u2032-hydroxyl end of the primer, and strand growth extends in \nthe 5 \u2032\u21923\u2032direction across the target DNA, making complementary \ncopies of the target. [Note: PCR products can be several thousand base pairs long.] At the completion of one cycle of replication, the reaction mixture is heated again to separate the strands (of which there are now four). Each strand binds a complementary primer, and the step of primer extension is repeated. By using a heat-stable DNA \npol (for example, Taq from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus that \nnormally lives at high temperatures), the polymerase  is not dena-\ntured and, therefore, does not have to be added at each succes-sive cycle. However, Taq lacks proofreading activity. Typically, \n20\u201330 cycles are run during this process, amplifying the DNA by a million-fold (2\n20) to a billion-fold (230). [Note: Each extension product \nincludes a sequence at its 5 \u2032-end that is complementary to the \nprimer (see Fig. 39.20 ). Thus, each newly synthesized strand can \nact as a template for the successive cycles (see Fig. 39.21 ). This \nleads to an exponential increase in the amount of target DNA with each cycle, hence, the name \u201cpolymerase chain reaction.\u201d] Probes can be made during PCR by adding labeled nucleotides to the last few cycles.\nB. Advantages\nThe major advantages of PCR over biologic cloning as a mechanism for amplifying a specific DNA sequence are sensitivity and speed. DNA sequences present in only trace amounts can be amplified to become the predominant sequence. PCR is so sensitive that DNA sequences present in an individual cell can be amplified and studied. Isolating and amplifying a specific DNA sequence by PCR is faster and less tech-nically difficult than traditional cloning methods using recombinant DNA techniques.\nC. Applications\nPCR has become a very common tool in research, forensics, and clinical diagnostics.\n 1.

GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS\nThe tools of biotechnology not only allow the study of gene structure, but \nalso provide ways of analyzing the mRNA and protein products of gene expression.\nA. Determining messenger RNA levels\nmRNA levels are usually determined by the hybridization of labeled probes to either mRNA itself or to cDNA produced from mRNA. [Note: Amplification by PCR of cDNA made from mRNA by retroviral reverse \ntranscriptase  (RT) is referred to as RT-PCR.]\n 1. Northern blots:  Northern blots are similar to Southern blots (see \nFig. 39.13 ), except that the sample contains a mixture of mRNA \nmolecules that are separated by electrophoresis, then transferred to a membrane and hybridized with a radiolabeled probe. The bands obtained by autoradiography give a measure of the amount and size of the mRNA molecules in the sample.\n 2. Microarrays:  DNA microarrays contain thousands of immobilized \nssDNA sequences organized in an area no larger than a micro-scope slide. These microarrays are used to analyze a sample for the presence of gene variations or mutations (genotyping) or to deter-mine the patterns of mRNA production (gene expression analysis), analyzing thousands of genes at the same time. For genotyping analysis, the sample is from genomic DNA. For expression anal-ysis, the population of mRNA molecules from a particular cell type is converted to cDNA and labeled with a fluorescent tag (\nFig. 39.23 ). \nThis mixture is then exposed to a gene (or, DNA) chip, which is a glass slide or membrane containing thousands of tiny spots of DNA, each corresponding to a different gene. The amount of fluo-rescence bound to each spot is a measure of the amount of that particular mRNA in the sample. DNA microarrays are used to deter-mine the differing patterns of gene expression in two different types of cell (for example, normal and cancer cells; see \nFig. 39.23 ). They \ncan also be used to subclassify cancers, such as breast cancer, to optimize treatment. [Note: Microarrays involving proteins and the antibodies or other proteins that recognize them are being used to identify biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease based on a patient\u2019s protein expression profile.

Protein analysis\nThe kinds and amounts of proteins in cells do not always directly corre-spond to the amounts of mRNA present. Some mRNA are translated more efficiently than others, and some proteins undergo posttransla-tional modification. When analyzing the abundance and interactions of a large number of proteins, automated methods involving a variety of techniques, such as mass spectrometry and two-dimensional elec-trophoresis, are used. When investigating one, or a limited number of proteins, labeled antibodies (Ab) are used to detect and quantify specific proteins and to determine posttranslational modifications.\n 1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays:  These assays (known as \nELISA) are performed in the wells of a microtiter dish. The antigen (protein) is bound to the plastic of the dish. The probe used consists of an Ab specific for the protein (such as troponin, see p. 148) to be measured. The Ab is covalently bound to an enzyme, which will produce a colored product when exposed to its substrate. The amount of color produced is proportional to the amount of Ab present and, indirectly, to the amount of protein in a test sample.\n 2. Western blots:  Western blots (also called immunoblots) are similar \nto Southern blots, except that it is protein molecules in the sample that are separated by electrophoresis and blotted (transferred) to a membrane. The probe is a labeled Ab, which produces a band at the location of its antigen.\n 3. Detecting exposure to human immunodeficiency virus:  ELISA \nand western blots are commonly used to detect exposure to HIV by measuring the amount of anti-HIV Ab present in a patient\u2019s blood sample. ELISA are used as the primary screening tool because they are very sensitive. Because these assays sometimes give false posi-tives, however, western blots, which are more specific, are often used as a confirmatory test (\nFig. 39.24 ). [Note: ELISA and western \nblots can only detect HIV exposure after anti-HIV Ab appear in the bloodstream. PCR-based testing for HIV is more useful in the first few months after exposure.]\nC. Proteomics\nThe study of the proteome, or all the proteins expressed by a genome, including their relative abundance, distribution, posttranslational modi-fications, functions, and interactions with other macromolecules, is known as proteomics. The 20,000\u201325,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome translate into well over 100,000 proteins when posttran-scriptional and posttranslational modifications are considered. Although a genome remains essentially unchanged, the amounts and types of proteins in any particular cell change dramatically as genes are turned on and off. [Note: Proteomics (and genomics) required the parallel develop-ment of bioinformatics, the computer-based organization, storage, and analysis of biologic data.] \nFigure 39.25  compares some of the analytic \ntechniques discussed in this chapter.63 bp\n60 bpPCR primer\nPCR primer\nHomo-\nzygotenormalHomo-\nzygotemutant(affected)Hetero-\nzygotemutant(carrier)Normal CFTR gene \nMutant CFTR gene \n60 bp\nd)\nHomo -\nzygo te\nnorma l\nHH\nz\nm\n(\nHomo-\nzygo te\nmutant\n(affecte d\nHetero-\nzygote\nmutant\ncarrier )\nMutant CFTR gene is\nmissing three bases(PCR gives a shorter- than-normal product).\nHeterozygote has both \na normal and a mutant allele of the CFTR gene, and PCR produces twoproducts.PCR followed by \nelectrophoresis \nof products\n+\u2013\nFigure 39.22\nGenetic testing for cystic fibrosis (CF) \nusing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

GENE THERAPY\nThe goal of gene therapy is to treat disease through delivery of the normal, \ncloned DNA for a gene into the somatic cells of a patient who has a defect in that gene as a result of a disease-causing mutation. Because somatic gene therapy changes only the targeted somatic cells, the change is not passed on to the next generation. [Note: In germline gene therapy, the germ cells are modified, and so the change is passed on. A long-standing moratorium on germline gene therapy is in effect worldwide.] There are two types of gene transfer: 1) ex vivo, in which cells from the patient are removed, transduced, and returned, and 2) in vivo, in which the cells are directly transduced. Both types require use of a viral vector to deliver the DNA. Challenges of gene therapy include development of vectors, achievement of long-lived expression, and prevention of side effects such as an immune response. The first successful gene therapy involved two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) caused by mutations to the gene for adenosine deaminase  (ADA, see p. 582). It \nutilized mature T lymphocytes transduced ex vivo with a retroviral vector (\nFig. 39.26 ). [Note: Human ADA cDNA is now used.] Since 1990, only a \nsmall number of patients (with a variety of disorders, such as hemophilia, cancers, and certain types of blindness) have been treated with gene therapy, with varying degrees of success.\nGene editing, as opposed to gene addition, allows a mutated gene to be \nrepaired. Combinations of DNA-binding molecules (proteins or RNA) and endonucleases  are used to identify and cleave the mutated sequence. \nCleavage activates homologous recombination repair of dsDNA breaks (see p. 429) that integrates DNA containing the correct sequence into the gene. [Note: An endonuclease  guided to a specific DNA sequence by a \ncustom-designed RNA has been used in gene editing in human cell lines. The technique is based on (and named for) the prokaryotic CRISPR- Cas9  \n(clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]-associated protein) system that identifies and cleaves foreign DNA in bacte-rial cells. CRISPR is currently used in the laboratory but not in the clinic.]\nX. TRANSGENIC ANIMALS\nTransgenic animals can be produced by injecting a cloned foreign gene (a transgene) into a fertilized egg. If the gene randomly and stably inte-grates into a chromosome, it will be present in the germline of the resulting animal and can be passed from generation to generation. A giant mouse called \u201cSupermouse\u201d was produced in this way by injecting the gene for rat growth hormone into a fertilized mouse egg. [Note: Transgenic animals have been designed that produce therapeutic human proteins in their milk, a process called \u201cpharming.\u201d Antithrombin, an anticlotting protein, was produced by transgenic goats and approved for clinical use in 2009.] If the functional transgene undergoes targeted (not random) insertion, a knockin (KI) mouse that expresses the gene is created. Targeted insertion of a nonfunctional version of the transgene creates a knockout (KO) mouse that does not express the gene. Such genetically engineered animals can serve as models for the study of a corresponding human disease.Normal cell\nmRNA\nReverse \ntranscriptase \ncDNACancer cell\nYellow spot: Both cells produce \nthe same amount of message.Green spot: Normal cell \nproduces more of its message.Mix cDNA \nand hybridizeto DNA microarray(gene chip)Label with red fluorescent moleculeLabel with green\nfluorescent molecule\nRed spot: Cancer cell produces \nmore of its message.\nspot: Cancer cell produces \nof its messa ge.Dark (black) spot: Neither cell produces this message.\nFigure 39.23\nMicroarray analysis of gene \nexpression using DNA (gene) chips.

Medical Perspectives \nRecombinant DNA technology is used to make biomolecules for treatment, diagnosis of disease, pedigree analysis, gene \ntherapy, forensic medicine and medical research.\n\u2022 Making biomolecules for treatment : Currently these techniques are being used to make in large quantities of insulin \n(human insulin), blood clotting factors VIII and IX and interferon for treatments, growth hormone, albumin, monoclonal antibodies and thrombolytic agents. Previously these biomolecules were taken from animals, other tissues or blood products and had the limitations of quantity production and transmission of infections.\n\u2022 Diagnosis of disease : Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are used \nfor diagnosis of diseases such as  sickle cell anemia, thalassemias and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n Infective diseases like HIV and tuberculosis can be diagnosed by PCR and specific probes, particularly in the window \nperiod. \n In the year 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and the diagnosis was done by real-time PCR against \nspecific genes of the SARS-CoV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2).\n Genetic methods are also used in diagnosis of cancers and tissue typing for transplants.\u2022 Genetic counseling  is an important part of prenatal diagnosis of heritable diseases and provides the patient  informa-\ntion about current pregnancies as well as aids planning for future pregnancies. This is specially important for families who have thalassemic traits, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, etc.\n\u2022 Gene therapy  is the utilization of genetic engineering for treatment of disease. The vision is to correct the basic genetic \nabnormality by replacement of mutant gene by normal one or correction of mutation. Gene therapy has not been \nsuccessful so far and is in research stages.\n Gene augmentation, which is only partially successful, involves introduction of foreign genetic material into cell to \ncompensate for defective product of mutant gene. The method of introduction in humans is by recombinant retrovi-ruses, adenoviruses or plasmid liposome complexes. Target cells so far used for gene augmentation are bone marrow cells, fibroblasts, tumor cells and epithelial cells of respiratory tract. \n For example, adenosine deaminase  (ADA) deficiency leads to lack of adequately functioning white blood cells and \nimmune deficiency. A viral vector was used to incorporate ADA gene from a twin to his brother who suffered from severe ADA deficiency. Levels of ADA in recipient increased transiently. \n\u2022 In forensic medicine , genetic techniques are used for crime detection (sample could be hair, semen, etc.). For parent-\nhood disputes and other issues, techniques used could be DNA fingerprinting, restriction map analysis, PCR, RFLP and use of specific probes.\n\u2022 In medical research , study of normal genes and those associated with disease is done by genetic methods. Gene for \npolycystic kidney disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy is localized on chromosome by RFLP and chromosome walking. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to localize gene for prolactin, insulin, and growth hormone.\n\u2022 Stem cells have an ability to divide for an unlimited period. They can give rise to specialized cell types. This property \nis known as developmental plasticity.\n Embryonic stem cells and cells of umbilical cord show developmental plasticity. Stem cells may be embryonic (capable \nof differentiation) or adult type (limited capacity of differentiation). Stem cells can be totipotent (capable of producing all cell types of organism), pluripotent (capable of generating cells of three germ layers), multipotent (capable of gener-ating only closely related cell types) and unipotent (generating only one cell type).\n There have been trials in the use of stem cells in the treatment of stroke, brain injury, parkinsonism, myocardial infarc-\ntion and spinal cord injury.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   696 24-10-2020   12:14:04"

            "Text": "XII. Chapter Summary 697\nXII. Chapter Summary\n\u2022 Restriction endonucleases  are bacterial enzymes that cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into smaller fragments. \nRestriction endonucleases are also called molecular scissors . Each enzyme cleaves at a specific 4\u20138 base-pair \nsequence (a restriction site), producing DNA segments called restriction fragments . The sequences that are recog-\nnized are palindromic . Restriction enzymes form either staggered cuts  (sticky ends ) or blunt-end cuts  on the DNA. \nBacterial DNA ligases  can join two DNA fragments from different sources if they have been cut by the same restric-\ntion endonuclease . This hybrid combination of two fragments is called a recombinant DNA molecule . Recombinant \nDNA  is the altered DNA that results from the insertion of a sequence of deoxynucleotides not previously present into \nan existing molecule of DNA by enzymatic or chemical means. It is also called chimeric  DNA if DNA is from two \ndifferent sources.\n\u2022 Amplification of the DNA may be done by PCR (in  vitro) or cloning (in  vivo). Introduction of a foreign DNA molecule into \na replicating cell permits the amplification  (production of many copies) of the DNA, a process called cloning . A vector  \nis a molecule of DNA to which the fragment of DNA to be cloned is joined. Vectors must be capable of autonomous \nreplication  within the host cell, must contain at least one specific nucleotide sequence recognized by a restriction \nendonuclease , and must carry at least one gene that confers the ability to select for the vector such as an antibiotic \nresistance gene . Prokaryotic organisms normally contain small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules called \nplasmids  that can serve as vectors. They can be readily isolated from the bacterium (or artificially constructed), joined \nwith the DNA of interest, and reintroduced into the bacterium, which will replicate, thus making multiple copies of the hybrid  plasmid. A DNA library  is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism. A genomic \nlibrary  is a collection of fragments of dsDNA obtained by digestion of the total DNA of the organism with a restriction \nendonuclease  and subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. It ideally contains a copy of every DNA nucleotide \nsequence in the genome. In contrast, complementary DNA  (cDNA ) libraries  contain only those DNA sequences that \nare complementary to processed messenger RNA  (mRNA) molecules present in a cell and differ according to cell \ntype and environmental conditions. Because cDNA has no introns, it can be cloned into an expression vector  for the \nsynthesis of human proteins by bacteria or eukaryotes. Cloned, then purified, fragments of DNA can be sequenced, for example, using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method . Probes are molecules used to detect the pres-\nence of a specific fragment of DNA or RNA or protein. Probes can be synthetic cDNA oligonucleotides (DNA probes), RNA oligonucleotides (RNA probes) and antibody probes. They can hybridize with specific DNA or RNA or cause an antigen-antibody bonding. For visualization, the probe may be radiolabeled, fluorescent or enzyme tagged. Probes are used to search samples for infectious agents, identify target in plaque or colony hybridization and blotting techniques as well as search libraries for specific genes.\n Southern blotting  is a technique that can be used to detect specific sequences present in DNA. The DNA is cleaved \nusing a restriction endonuclease , after which the pieces are separated by gel electrophoresis  and are denatured \nand transferred (blotted) to a nitrocellulose membrane  for analysis. The fragment of interest is detected using a \nprobe. The human genome contains many thousands of polymorphisms  (DNA sequence variations at a given locus). \nPolymorphisms can arise from single-base changes and from tandem repeats. A polymorphism can serve as a genetic marker that can be followed through families. A restriction fragment length polymorphism  (RFLP\n) is a genetic variant \nthat can be observed by cleaving the DNA into restriction fragments using a restriction enzyme. A base substitution in one or more nucleotides at a restriction site can render the site unrecognizable by a particular restriction endonuclease . \nA new restriction site also can be created by the same mechanism. In either case, cleavage with the endonuclease  \nresults in fragments of lengths differing from the normal that can be detected by hybridization  with a probe. RFLP \nanalysis  can be used to diagnose genetic diseases early in the gestation of a fetus. The polymerase chain reac-\ntion (PCR ), another method for amplifying  a selected DNA sequence, does not rely on the biologic cloning method. \nPCR permits the synthesis of millions of copies of a specific nucleotide sequence in a few hours. It can amplify the sequence, even when the targeted sequence makes up less than one part in a million of the total initial sample. The method can be used to amplify DNA sequences from any source. Applications of the PCR technique include 1) effi-cient comparison of a normal gene with a mutant form of the gene, 2) forensic analysis of DNA samples, 3) detec-tion of low-abundance nucleic acid sequences, and 4) prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection (for example, of cystic fibrosis). The products of gene expression (mRNA and proteins) can be measured by techniques such as northern \nblots , which are like Southern blots except that the sample contains a mixture of mRNA  molecules that are separated \nby electrophoresis, then hybridized to a radiolabeled probe; microarrays  are used to determine the differing patterns \nof gene expression in two different types of cells (for example, normal and cancer cells); enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assays  (ELISA ); and western blots  (immunoblots ) are used to detect specific proteins. Proteomics  is the \nstudy of all the proteins expressed by a genome. The goal of gene therapy  is the insertion of a normal cloned gene to \nreplace a defective gene in a somatic cell , whereas the goal of gene editing  is the repair of a mutated gene. Insertion \nof a foreign gene (transgene) into the germline of an animal creates a transgenic animal  that can produce therapeutic \nproteins or serve as gene knockin  or knockou t models for human diseases.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   697 24-10-2020   12:14:04"

Most of such genetic disorders present as spontaneous abortions, bad obstetric history, mental retardations and malformations.

The immune system \nis able to distinguish self from nonself and respond only to nonself molecules. This is known as immunological tolerance. The immunological identity of self is defined in utero. Natural or innate immunity is what we are born with, and acquired (or adaptive) immunity is what we develop after birth by exposure to immunogens (Chapter 42).\n Cellular immunity is mediated by T cells which recognize and kill pathogens at cellular level, and humoral immunity \ninvolves the production of soluble and secreted antibodies (e.g., IgM and IgG) by the B cells and plasma cells. Components of both cellular immunity and humoral immunity communicate with and assist each other (Chapter 43).\n Antigen exposure leads to the formation of antibodies which in turn neutralize the antigens (Chapter 41). Some \norgans like thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and some specialized immunological cells like T cells, B cells and natural killer cells are more involved in immunological process (Chapter 40). These cells not only deal with the invaders but also remember them (memory cells) so that next-time recognition and response can be faster. \n Allergy and hypersensitivity are exaggerated and inappropriate immune responses to an antigen, e.g., asthmatic \nresponse to a normal pollen (Chapter 43). Immunodeficiency is an inadequate response to an antigen, e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) subsequent to HIV infection or severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). Autoimmunity means an immunological attack against one\u2019s own cells; it is seen in many diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n The primary healthcare physician must be aware that immunity may be natural, acquired by exposure to infections \nor acquired by vaccination. In India, children are given vaccines, such as BCG, DPT, OPV and hepatitis B, under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). Immunization can be active when vaccines are given or passive when preformed immunoglobulins are given (Chapter 44). In blood transfusions, antigen-antibody typing of blood donor and recipient should be followed stringently to avoid reactions and even death (Chapter 43). The knowledge of immunology is also important for success of organ transplantation. The immune system is also therapeutically exploited to eliminate cancer cells. This field is known as cancer immunotherapy.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   704 24-10-2020   12:14:05"

OVERVIEW OF IMMUNE SYSTEM\nImmune system is a complex system that has been organized to protect \nthe body from other organisms and foreign substances. It comprises of several organs and cells which form a dynamic network that recognizes and eliminates the pathogens. The immune system is capable of distin-guishing different types of pathogens by recognizing their molecular patterns and chemical differences. Human pathogens are mainly viruses (causing AIDS, influenza, etc.), bacteria (causing tuberculosis, tetanus), fungi (causing candidiasis, ringworm) and parasites (causing malaria). Exposure to pathogens allows immune system to respond with two types of responses, effector response and memory response. Pathogens are eliminated through effector response, whereas memory response protects the host from infection by same pathogen on subsequent occasions. Also, the memory response of the immune system has led to the development of vaccines against different types of pathogens. Immunity can be innate which provides first and second line of defense against pathogens or adap-tive which provides third line of defense against pathogens. Innate immu-nity involves phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis and pinocytosis and is mediated through interferons and complements. Adaptive immunity which is more specific acts after few days of exposure to antigens and is mediated through B cells and T cells, and antibodies. Several organs and cells are responsible for the development of immune responses. Among the lymphoid organs, thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen play a major role in the formation, differentiation and maturation of immune cells like lymphocytes and phagocytes. Any dysfunction of the immune system fails to protect the host against infections and can lead to debilitating disor-ders like allergies, asthma, autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders.Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the organs and cells of the immune system \n\u2022 Explain primary and secondary immunodeficiencies \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   705 24-10-2020   12:14:05"

FUNCTIONS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nThe main function of the immune system is to protect the host against \ninfections and foreign substances. It eliminates pathogens through phago-cytes and lymphocytes. Phagocytes like monocytes and macrophages internalize pathogens and degrade them. Lymphocytes degrade patho-gens through B cells which produce antibodies or T cells which destroy the infected cells. Another function of the immune system is to discrimi-nate between the body's own tissue ( self) and foreign material ( non-self ). \nImmune system is also needed for the maintenance of gut flora in a manner that is beneficial to the body. \nIII.  ORGANS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEIR \nROLE IN IMMUNE FUNCTION\nThe organs of the immune system are broadly classified as primary and \nsecondary lymphoid organs based on their functions.\nPrimary (central) lymphoid organs  are the thymus and the bone marrow \nwhich are involved in the maturation of lymphocytes. Secondary (peripheral) \nlymphoid organs  are lymph nodes, spleen and gut-associated lymphoid \ntissue (GALT) which is a part of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which allow interaction of matured lymphocytes with the antigen. Tertiary lymphoid organs are abnormal lymphoid structures which develop in some peripheral organs because of chronic inflammation.\nA. Thymus\nIt is a flat organ situated above heart and comprises of cortex and medulla (\nFig. 40.1 ). Cortex is in the outer layer and contains immature \nT cells known as thymocytes. These T-cell precursors originate in the bone marrow, from where they migrate to the thymic cortex for matura-tion. Maturation is facilitated by the presence of cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells. Some thymic epithelial cells in the outer cortex, called nurse cells have long membranous extensions. As thymocytes mature, they migrate to medulla and then leave the thymus. The main function of thymus is development and maturation of T cells. As age advances, the structure and function of thymus begin to decline. Thymus undergoes atrophy after puberty accompanied by reduction in the generation of T cells. Immune dysfunction in elderly people has \nFigure 40.1\nDiagrammatic representation of a cross-section of portion of thymus.Capsule\nNurse cell s\nCortex\nMedullaCortico-\nmedullary\njunctionCortical epithelial \ncells\nDeveloping \nthymocytes\nHematopoietic \nprecursor\nMedullary  \nepithelial cells\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   706 24-10-2020   12:14:05"

DiGeorge syndrome  which \noccurs due to congenital defect in the development of thymus, due to a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22 is associated with a reduc-tion in T cells and absence of cell-mediated immunity.\nB. Bone marrow\nBone marrow comprises of hematopoietic stem cells and progen-itor cells in a stroma composed of adipocytes, macrophages, mesen-chymal cells, sympathetic neurons, and extracellular matrix. It is the site where hematopoietic cells are generated and distributed to other cells of the body. In humans, bone marrow is involved in proliferation and development of B cells and secretion of cytokines. Differentiation of B cells is achieved due to reticular cells which are located near the endosteum and central sinus.\nC. Lymph nodes\nThey are bean-shaped structures, which are involved in neutralizing the antigens present in the lymphatic fluid  draining into the lymph node. It consists of an outer layer (cortex) which contains B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, middle layer (paracortex) containing T lymphocytes and an inner layer (medulla) containing plasma cells which secrete antibodies (\nFig. 40.2 ). Afferent lymphatic vessels enter \nthe capsule at multiple sites and drain lymph into the subcapsular sinus. As lymph having antigen from tissues passes through the node, antigen is trapped by phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs - dendritic cells, B cells and macro-phages) present these trapped antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to the activa-tion of T cells, which in turn activate B cells. Lymphoid follicles are of two types\u2014primary follicles and secondary follicles. Primary folli-cles are aggregates of B-cells, while secondary follicles are character-ized by the presence of a specialized feature known as germinal center. Germinal center comprises of activated and proliferating B cells, along \nFigure 40.2\nDiagrammatic representation of a cross-section of a portion of lymph node.\nAfferent\nlymphatic\nGerminal\ncenter of\nsecondary\nfollicleCollagenous capsuleSubcapsular sinus\nCortex\nPrimary follicle\nParacortex\nHilus\nEfferent\nlymphatic\nArtery\nVeinMedulla\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   707 24-10-2020   12:14:06"

During infection, the blood-borne lympho-cytes migrate to lymph nodes in response to pathogens and proliferate further resulting in lymph node enlargement.\nD. Spleen\nIt is an ovoid-shaped organ situated in left side of abdominal cavity. Spleen plays a key role in trapping blood-borne antigens and removal of old and defective red blood cells. It consists of two types of compart-ments\u2014red pulp and white pulp (\nFig. 40.3 ). Red pulp has venous \nsinuses which contain macrophages, lymphocytes, granulocytes, eryth-rocytes and platelets. Old and defective red blood cells are destroyed and removed in the red pulp by macrophages. White pulp located along the branches of the splenic artery consists of cells involved in the adaptive immune response, and is separated from the red pulp by a marginal zone. Immediately close to the arterial branches is the peri-arteriolar lymphatic sheath (PALS), which is rich in T cells. B cell rich zone is present between the PALS and the marginal zone. The marginal zone which surrounds the white pulp contains B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Activation of B cells and T cells and presentation of antigen to T cells occur in periarteriolar lymphoid sheath. Surgical removal of spleen due to tumors or coagulation disorders increases the risk of bacterial infections and children are at higher risk compared to adults.\nIV.  CELLS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEIR ROLE IN \nIMMUNE FUNCTION\nA. B Lymphocytes (B cells/CD19/CD20 cells)\nB cells develop in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells \n(Fig. 40.4 ) and constitute about 20% of lymphocytes. Their major func-\ntion is to produce antibodies. Most of the B cells in circulation express immunoglobulins M and D (IgM and IgD), whereas B cells in tissues express IgG, IgE, and IgA. Exposure of na\u00efve B cells to foreign anti-gens leads to binding of antigens to antibodies resulting in maturation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells and memory cells. Plasma cells produce antibodies and memory cells allow a rapid response if the same infection is encountered again. Human B cells can be identified mainly by markers like CD19, CD20 and CD21.\nB. T Lymphocytes (T cells/CD3 cells)\nT cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and mature in thymus (\nFig. 40.4 ). T cells have different abilities to recognize \nantigens and are varied in their function. APCs process peptide anti-gens and present them to T cells.\nT cells can be classified into \u201ckiller\u201d or cytotoxic T cells (CD8\n+ T cells), \nT-helper cells (CD4+ T cells), and regulatory T cells.\n 1. Cytotoxic T cells  destroy the infected cells and protect the body \nfrom certain bacteria, fungus and viruses that have the ability to survive and reproduce within the body\u2019s own cells. They also provide antitumor immunity.Figure 40.3\nDiagrammatic representation of a cross-\nsection of a portion of spleen.\nCapsule\nRed pulp with\nmacrophages, RBC, platelets, granulocytes\nWhite pulp\nwith periarteriolar lymphatic sheath Splenic artery\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   708 24-10-2020   12:14:06"

Helper T cells  assist B cells to produce antibodies and assist cyto-\ntoxic T cells in their attack on infected or transformed cells. Th1 cells secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- D), etc. which stimulate macrophages, natural \nkiller (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 which stimulate B cells and synthesis of antibodies. Helper T cell subtypes include T\nH-17 cells and Follicular Helper \nT cells (T FH cells). T H-17 cells produce IL-17 and are involved in \nantifungal and antibacterial immunity. T FH cells assist B cells in the \nformation of germinal center.\n 3. Regulatory T cells  are considered as negative regulators of the \nimmune system as they suppress immune responses. It is essential for the optimal utilization of our immune system once the infection is cured. They secrete IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-E) which suppress the function of T cell subtypes and dendritic \ncells. Suboptimal functioning of regulatory T cell (T\nreg cells) can result \nin autoimmunity.\nC. Natural killer cells (NK cells) \nNK  cells recognize and kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cells \nare derived from the bone marrow ( Fig. 40.4 ) and are present in rela-\ntively low numbers in the human peripheral blood. NK cells constantly monitor other cells. The killing activity of NK cells depends on the balance of signals from activating receptors and inhibitory receptors on the NK cell surface. Healthy cells express MHC I receptors, which are recognized by inhibitory receptors on NK cells and prevent their killing. Cancer cells and infected cells often lose their MHC I, leaving them vulnerable to NK cell killing. They are particularly important in the defense against herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus [HSV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], chickenpox). NK cells destroy the targeted cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC, see Chapter 43).\nD. Neutrophils\nNeutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes/granulocytes) are the most abundant type of white blood cells. They develop from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Their major role is to ingest bacteria or fungi and kill them. Neutrophils also employ both oxygen-depen-dent and oxygen-independent pathways to generate antimicrobial substances. Neutrophils play a larger role than macrophages in killing ingested microorganisms. The primary granules contain acid hydrolase , \nlysozyme and myeloperoxidase , and secondary granules contain lacto-\nferrin and lysozyme. Antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) activate neutrophils releasing its contents causing destruction of pathogens. Neutrophils are responsible for the formation of \u201cpus,\u201d and increase in the number of neutrophils in circulation is used as an indi-cator of acute bacterial infection.\nPus is composed primarily of live and dead neutrophils. The \npresence of pus generally reflects an acute inflammatory process. It may be localized, such as abscess, or dissem-inated through tissue planes. Infections which induce pus formation are called pyogenic infections.\u201cCluster of differentiation\u201d (CD) antigens\nThey are molecules present \non the surface of lympho-cytes, which can be detected using monoclonal antibodies. The CD nomenclature was proposed and established in the 1st International Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Antigens in 1982. Since then, more than 400 molecules have been desig-nated. CD markers are used to identify lineage of cells. Various immune cells express different CD markers during different stages of develop-ment, which is used for their identification.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   709 24-10-2020   12:14:06"

Monocytes and macrophages\nBoth monocytes and macrophages are considered as mononuclear \nphagocytes in blood and tissues, respectively. Monocytes migrate to tissues and differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages are charac-terized by increase in size, increase in the number of organelles, and increase in the ability to phagocytose microorganisms. Macrophages are activated mainly by mediators of inflammation and cytokines.\nF. Eosinophils\nEosinophils constitute around 0%\u20136% of leukocytes. They contain cytoplasmic granules, which are rich in major basic protein and act as potent toxin for parasites. The eosinophils have Fc receptors for IgE and IgG. They can bind to the antibody-coated parasite and destroy it by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).\nG. Basophils\nBasophils constitute less than 1% of leukocytes and play a role in mediating allergy.\nH. Dendritic cells\nDendritic cells arise from hematopoietic stem cells and are covered with long membranous extensions. They act as APCs and play a key role as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems. Four types of dendritic cells are known\u2014Langerhans cells, inflammatory dendritic cells, classical (or conventional) dendritic cells, and plasma-cytoid dendritic cells.\nV. COMPLEMENT SYSTEM\nComplements are plasma proteins which assist the immune cells in elimi-nating the pathogens. They are synthesized in liver. They eliminate pathogens by cytolysis, inflammation, and by facilitating phagocytosis. Complements are activated either by classical pathway or by alternate pathway. These pathways are described in detail in chapter 48. \nVI.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) AND \nACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)\nAIDS, which is the result of advanced stage disease due to HIV, is one \nof the common causes of secondary immune deficiency (Note: The most common cause of secondary immune deficiency is malnutrition). The caus-ative agent in AIDS is HIV, which has two genetically distinct forms\u2014HIV-1 and HIV-2; worldwide, infection by HIV-1 is more common and severe. HIV is a retrovirus and replicates with the help of an RNA-dependent DNA poly-merase (reverse transcriptase).\nA. Transmission\nThe disease is transmitted from infected individuals through unpro-tected sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, and sharing of needles (especially in context of intravenous drug abuse). The disease can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and lactation. Antigen-presenting cells \n(APCs)\nAPCs are leukocytes which \nare involved in the activa-tion of T cells. Dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells are the major APCs. They express class II MHC molecules  and present antigens to helper T cells.\nT cells cannot be activated \nunless the antigen is presented along with MHC molecules by APCs. This is known as MHC restriction of T cells.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   710 24-10-2020   12:14:06"

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) 711\nHealthcare workers are also at risk of infection when exposed to the \nvirus-containing body fluids via mucosal contact, needle prick injury, etc.\nB. Pathogenesis\nThe virus attaches to CD4 receptor present on leukocytes (predomi-nantly expressed by T-helper cells, but also found in monocytes/macro-phages and dendritic cells) via a viral surface glycoprotein known as gp120. gp120 also needs a coreceptor for its binding to the cells; this role is facilitated by chemokine receptors\u2014CCR5 in case of T-helper cells and CXCR4 in case of monocytes/macrophages. After fusion with the host cell membrane, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it is converted to double-stranded DNA by the reverse transcrip-tase present in the virus. This involves the formation of an RNA-DNA hybrid intermediate. The double-stranded DNA (also known as proviral DNA) integrates into the host DNA with the aid of an enzyme, inte-grase. The host transcription machinery, while transcribing the region of the genome containing the proviral DNA, generates multiple copies of viral RNA. Translation of this viral RNA results in the formation of a polyprotein, which is cleaved by a viral protease  into multiple viral \nproteins including reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease , as well \nas several viral proteins that are required for the packaging of the virus. These proteins along with the viral RNA are packaged into new virions by incorporating the host cell membrane; the virions are released usually by cell lysis, resulting in the death of the host cells. Macrophages act as reservoirs of the virus during HIV infection.\nThe integrated virus can remain latent for prolonged periods within \nthe infected cells; cell death ensues only when the transcription of the proviral DNA is active.\nC. Clinical features\nSince CD4+ T-helper cells play a key role in the activation of cellular \nas well as humoral immunity, a reduction in the number of these cells leads to a drastic deterioration of the immune function leading to secondary immune deficiency. The full-blown disease characterized by opportunistic infections by otherwise innocuous pathogens (i.e., organisms that are non-pathogenic in case of an immunocompetent individual) occur only when the CD4\n+ T cell numbers reach a nadir\u2014\nusually when the CD4+ T cell count is less than 200 cells/\u03bcl of blood. \nApart from T cells, other immune cells are also affected. Production of cytokines from macrophages can lead to polyclonal B cell activa-tion and increased immunoglobin levels, and malignant B cell prolifer-ation leading to lymphomas. However, T cell mediated B cell activation is severely compromised due to reduction in the CD4\n+ T cell count. \nImmune-surveillance against cancer is also affected, and viral-medi-ated cancers like Kaposi sarcoma (mediated by a type of herpesvirus) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (due to Epstein-Barr virus) are common in individuals with AIDS.\nD.

It may be due to defect in the development of \nB cells and T cells, defect in the signaling required for activation of these cells or absence of complements or due to defect in effector functions of the immune system. It can be of two types\u2014primary immunodeficiency and secondary immunodeficiency.\nCD4/CD8 count ratio can be used as an index to measure the ratio of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T cells. the normal ratio \nis 2:1 and it is altered in certain immunodeficiency disorders.\nPrimary Immunodeficiency\nIt is due to immune dysfunction caused by genetic defects in the components of innate and adaptive immunity. It can \naffect both lymphoid and myeloid cells resulting in the loss of function in T cells/B cells and phagocytes. The affected individuals are susceptible to infections and mortality is higher at younger age. Examples for primary immunodeficiency disorders are severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), ataxia telangiectasia, and Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\nSCID is characterized by dysfunction of T cell and B cell. Deficiency of adenosine deaminase enzyme is one of the \ncommon causes of SCID. Recurrent infections, chronic diarrhea, pneumonia, and lesions of oral cavity are the most common clinical features. Reduction in the number of lymphocytes in blood is a feature of SCID.\nSecondary Immunodeficiency\nThey are more common than primary immunodeficiency disorders and usually develop later in life. They occur due to \nacquired causes like HIV/AIDS and in patients who are on immunosuppressants, (e.g., glucocorticoids), and in recipients of radiotherapy. Diabetes mellitus can also cause immune dysfunction later in life.\nVIII. Chapter Summary\nImmune system is an organized network in the body which protects the host from foreign particles like toxins and patho-gens. The organs of immune system are classified into primary and secondary organs. Primary lymphoid organs are thymus and bone marrow which are involved in the maturation of lymphocytes. Secondary lymphoid organs are lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphatic tissues associated with the skin and the mucosal layers which allow interaction of matured lymphocytes with the antigen. The major immune cells are B cells, T cells, neutrophils, NK cells and APCs like macro-phages and dendritic cells. B cells produce antibodies which eliminate pathogens by activating complement system and other effector mechanisms. Macrophages eliminate pathogens by phagocytosis and presenting them to T cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy the infected cells by releasing cytokines, which are involved in apoptosis of infected cells (\nFig. 40.4 ). \nImmunodeficiency disorders occur due to malfunction of the immune system. They may be primary if the defect is due to genetic causes or secondary if they are due to acquired causes.immunoassays. CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral RNA load are used to \nmonitor the progression of disease. \nE. Treatment\nNowadays, drugs are available to reduce the viral RNA load, and provide a better quality of life in people living with HIV/AIDS. These drugs are used in combination, and target various steps in the viral replication cycle like membrane fusion, reverse transcription, integration into the host genome, cleavage of polyprotein, etc. Vaccine development for prevention of HIV infection still remains a challenge, primarily due to the high rate of mutations in the virus, attributed to a highly error-prone DNA synthesis by the reverse transcriptase.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   712 24-10-2020   12:14:06"

OVERVIEW \nAntigens and antibodies are important components of the immune system. \nWhen a foreign antigen such as microorganisms or toxins enter the body, our immune system responds by activation of B lymphocytes to secrete antibodies. Antigens bind to antibodies through epitopes which are immu-nologically active regions of the antigen. Antibodies which are constitu-ents of B cells are membrane bound and those produced by plasma cells are secreted. Interaction of antigen with membrane-bound antibodies leads to proliferation of B cells and secreted antibodies mark the antigen for destruction. Most antigens contain different epitopes and a single B cell will produce monoclonal antibodies only, against one epitope of the antigen. Since many B cells are activated in response to multiple epitopes in the antigen, B cell responses to natural infections are usually polyclonal. The antigenic specificity of an antibody is determined by the organization and rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes during B cell maturation. Antigens and antibodies can be detected by several types of immunoassays which are useful for the detection of infections, and diagnosis of hormonal imbal-ance and cancers. Antibodies formed against self-antigens lead to autoim-mune disease.\nII. ANTIGENS\nAntigens can be defined as molecules that contain distinct sites (epit-opes) which are recognized by and interact with various components of the immune system, like B-cell and T-cell receptors.\nA.

Antigens \nare classified based on immunogenicity, origin of antigen, source of antigen and on their ability to induce antibody formation (\nFig. 41.1 ).\n 1. Based on immunogenicity:  Antigens can be classified as (i) \ncomplete antigen/immunogen which are capable of inducing anti-body formation or T-cell response and (ii) incomplete antigen/hapten which cannot induce the formation of antibodies or T-cell response.\n 2. Based on the source of antigen:  Antigens can be exogenous anti-\ngens which enter the body through inhalation or ingestion. These antigens are presented to T helper cells through antigen-presenting cells (APCs) using class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Endogenous antigens are generated in the cell from the endogenous proteins. The abnormal peptides derived from viral infected cells and cancer cells are presented by MHC-I molecules to cytotoxic T-cells. \nEndogenous antigens can further be classified as:\n a.

These are mostly protein antigens and are processed by APCs to be presented to T cells, which are then activated. Activated T-helper cells further lead to B cell activation and antibody production. Activated B and T cells also lead to formation of memory cells and immu-nological memory. They are rapidly cleared from the body and do not cause tolerance.\n b. T cell-independent antigens:  Antigens directly stimulate B cells \nto produce antibodies. These antigens are not processed by APCs and do not produce immunological memory. They remain in the body for long time and cause tolerance, e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharides.\nB. Determinants of immunogenicity\nThese are the properties which make a substance immunogenic.\n\u2022 Size : Generally, larger molecules are more antigenic, and smaller \nmolecules are less antigenic. Larger molecules are more immuno-genic as they are readily phagocytosed and processed as compared to smaller molecules.\n\u2022 Nature of the molecule : Proteins are more antigenic compared to \ncarbohydrates/lipids/nucleic acids.\n\u2022 Foreignness : Antigens from other individuals of the same species are \nless antigenic than those from other species.\n\u2022 Heterogeneity : Heteropolymers are more antigenic compared to \nhomopolymers.\n\u2022 Immunogen dosage and route of administration : Optimal dosage and \nparenteral administration increase antigenicity.\n\u2022 Host genetic makeup\nIII. IMMUNOGLOBULINS\nImmunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are glycoprotein mole-\ncules produced by plasma cells. They participate in the humoral immune response by acting against specific antigens.\nA. Structure of immunoglobulins\nImmunoglobulins have four polypeptide chains (2 heavy chains and 2 light chains) linked with each other by disulfide bonds (\nFig. 41.2 ). \nHeavy chains are designated as gamma ( \u03b3), alpha ( \u03b1), mu ( \u03bc), delta ( \u03b4) \nand epsilon ( \u03b5). Light chains are designated as kappa ( \u03ba) and lambda ( \u03bb). \nA single antibody molecule will have only one type of light chain and one type of heavy chain. Immunoglobulins consists of:\n 1. Variable region:  It is present in both the heavy and the light chains. \nThe amino acid sequence in the variable region is highly different for antibodies that arise from different B cell clones. It provides speci-ficity for antibodies to bind with antigens.Figure 41.2\nStructure of immunoglobulin.

It defines how a specific antibody will contribute to immune response.\n 3. Hinge region:  It provides flexibility and facilitates binding of anti-\nbody with antigen.\n 4. Fc region:  It comprises only of the heavy chains. It interacts with \ncell surface receptors called Fc receptors and some proteins of the complement system. (Fc stands for \u201cfragment, crystallizable\u201d, because it crystallizes during cold storage.)\n 5. Fab region:  It contains antigen-binding site and is composed of the \nvariable regions of both heavy and light chains.\nB. Classification of immunoglobulins\nImmunoglobulins can be classified into IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE based on type of heavy chain found in the molecule. Each class of immunoglobulins and their functions are given in \nFigure 41.3 .\nC. Immunoglobulin genes\nThe heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins are coded by immuno-globulin genes located on different chromosomes. In humans, the gene for heavy chain is located on chromosome 14, kappa ( N) light chain \ngene is on chromosome 2 and lambda ( O) light chain gene is on chro-\nmosome 22. The light chain genes contain V (variable region), J (joining region) and C (constant region) gene segments and the heavy chain gene contains V, D (diversity region), J and C gene segments. The VJ gene segment in light chain and VDJ gene segments in heavy chain code for variable regions in the light and heavy chains, respectively. The C gene segment codes for constant region in both the chains.\n 1. Light chain gene segments:  In lambda chain, there are 30 V \nsegments, 4 J segments and 7 C segments. In kappa chain, there are 40 V segments, 5 J segments and 1 C segment.\n 2. Heavy chain gene segments:  In heavy chain, there are 39 V \nsegments, 23 D segments, 6 J segments and series of C segments.\nD. Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement\nThe gene segments of immunoglobulin gene undergo rearrangement during maturation of B cells to form functional Ig gene. Rearrangement of variable region gene occurs in heavy chain followed by light chains. This results in the formation of immunocompetent B cells which can produce antibodies. Rearrangement of constant region genes in heavy chain results in class switching of immunoglobulins during primary and secondary immune responses.\n 1. Variable-region gene rearrangement:  Rearrangement of V and \nJ segments facilitates the expression of kappa and lambda light chains. After V-J joining, the rearranged light chain gene contains leader exon, introns, combined VJ segment and constant region. This then undergo transcription, posttranscriptional modifications like splicing and polyadenylation, and subsequent translation to form functional light chain. In heavy chain DNA, D and J segments join forming DJ segment which joins with V segment forming VDJ segments. The rearranged heavy chain DNA contains leader exon, Types of \nImmuno-globulins (Isotype/Allotype)Functions of \nImmunoglobulins\nIgG\n(IgG1, IgG2, \nIgG3, IgG4)Crosses placenta and \nprovide immunity to fetus\nComplement activation, \nagglutination\nResponsible for Rh \nisoimmunization\nEnables secondary im-\nmune response\nIgM Enables primary immune \nresponse\nComplement activation, \nagglutination\nIgA\n(IgA1, IgA2)Secretory antibodies\nAgglutination\nIgD Facilitates immune re-\nsponse from B cells\nIgE Mediates allergy and \nanaphylaxis\nCauses mast cell de-\ngranulation and release of histamine\nFigure 41.3\nClasses of immunoglobulins and their \nfunctions.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   719 24-10-2020   12:14:08"

The variable-region gene rearrangement is facil-itated by the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) surrounding VDJ segments, and proteins RAG-1/RAG-2 (recombination-acti-vating genes) which allow joining of VJ and VDJ segments in light and heavy chains, respectively.\n 2. Constant-region gene rearrangement (Class switching):  After \nantigenic stimulation of B cells, the expression of IgM changes to other isotypes (apart from IgM). This is known as class switching and involves rearrangement  of heavy-chain DNA where the V\nHDHJH \nunit can combine with any C H gene segment. It involves switch \nregions (short repeats of GAGCT and TGGGG) located upstream of C segment, cytokines like IL-4 and an enzyme known as activation-\ninduced cytidine deaminase (AID) . The details of class switching \nand its significance are described in the Chapter 43.\nIV. ANTIBODY DIVERSITY\nIt is the ability of the immune system to produce antibodies against wide range of antigens. There are multiple ways through which antibody diver-sity can be generated.\nA. Existence of multiple V, D, J gene segments\nThe human B cell germline contains multiple V, D, J gene segments, which can undergo rearrangements to produce a wide variety of antigen-binding regions.\nB. Random combination of VJ or VDJ segments\nThe V, D and J segments can join with each other in any random combi-nation to generate the diversity. The heavy chain genes can form 5,382 (39 X 23 X 6) combination of gene segments, O chain forms 120 (30 X 4) \nand N chain forms 200 (40 X 5) combination of gene segments.\nC. Junctional flexibility\nIt refers to the flexibility of the region where VDJ segments join. During \nVDJ rearrangement, recombination signal sequences (RSSs) join accu-rately and coding sequences join without much accuracy. This leads to variation of amino acid sequences in the hypervariable region in immu-noglobulins which causes increased antibody diversity.\nD. Addition of P-nucleotides and N-nucleotides\nDuring immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, enzymes coded by recombination-activating genes (RAG)-1/2 cleave DNA and generate hairpin-like structure. Endonucleases cleave hairpin, and comple-\nmentary nucleotides are added generating palindromic sequences (P-nucleotides) at coding joint. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase \n(TdT) catalyze the addition of nucleotides (N-nucleotides) at the site of \nV (D) J joining forming short amino acid sequences at variable region.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   720 24-10-2020   12:14:08"

Somatic hypermutation\nIt is a process in which the point mutations in variable region gene \nsegments alter the specificity of antibodies. It is called as hypermu-tation, since the frequency of mutation is 100,000 folds higher than the spontaneous mutation of other genes. Somatic hypermutation allows B cells to generate antibodies which can bind to pathogens in more precise manner. This process involves nucleotide substitution throughout the VJ or VDJ segments.\nF. Association of heavy chains and light chains\nDue to V(D)J rearrangement, 5,382 heavy chain genes and 320 light chain genes are generated. These heavy chains and light chains are associated randomly and generates increased antibody diversity.\nV. ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY INTERACTION\nIt is the interaction between the epitope of the antigen and variable region of the antibodies, known as paratopes. Antigens are associated with the antibodies through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, or van der Waals interactions. Various immunological assays used for diagnostic purposes are based on Ag-Ab interactions. (Epitope, also known as anti-genic determinant, is the site of an antigen molecule that interacts with a specific site in the variable region of an antibody molecule, known as a paratope.)\nA. Precipitation reactions\nInteraction of antibodies with soluble antigens form precipitins. Precipitation reactions form the basis for immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis.\n 1. Immunodiffusion:  Here, antigens and antibodies diffuse toward \neach other in agar and form precipitate on interaction. Visible precipitation occurs in region where antigen and antibody concen-trations are equal.\n 2. Immunoelectrophoresis:  It is based on double immunodiffusion. \nElectrophoresis is done to separate the antigen mixture by charge. Troughs are cut into the agar gel parallel to the direction of the elec-tric field, and antiserum is added to the troughs. Diffusion of anti-body and antigen towards each other produce lines of precipitation where they meet. In laboratory, it is used for the diagnosis of condi-tions like amyloidosis and in infections like echinococcosis.\nB. Agglutination reactions\nInteraction of antibodies with particulate antigens form agglutinins. Excess antibodies inhibit agglutination reactions and this effect is known as prozone effect. Agglutination reactions are used for blood typing and in diagnosis of bacterial infections.\nC.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay:  In ELISA, the antigens are \nallowed to interact with antibody labeled to an enzyme. On addition of substrate, a colored product is formed. The enzymes commonly used are alkaline phosphatase  and horseradish peroxidase . ELISA \nare of three types\u2014indirect ELISA, competitive ELISA and sandwich ELISA. It is mainly used for the detection of HIV, HBsAg, hormones and tumor markers.\n a. Types of ELISA\ni. Direct ELISA:  In direct ELISA, antigen (target) is immobi-\nlized to the plate (solid surface). An enzyme-labeled anti-body against the antigen is added, which binds to the antigen. On addition of substrate, the enzyme linked to the antibody reacts with it to produce a visible signal that can be measured. The amount of signal is proportional to the amount of antigen (\nFig. 41.4 ). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) \nenzymes are commonly used to label antibodies, which acts on substrate such as tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce color.\nii. Indirect ELISA:  In indirect ELISA, both a primary antibody \n(against the antigen, unlabeled) and a secondary antibody (against the primary antibody, labeled with enzyme) are used. The primary antibody binds to the antigen on the plate, and then the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Addition of substrate produces a signal due to enzymatic reaction that can be measured. \niii. Sandwich ELISA:  In sandwich ELISA, the antibody, known \nas capture antibody, is immobilized to the plate. Antigen of interest binds to the capture antibody. Then enzyme-labeled detection antibody is added. On addition of substrate, the enzyme reacts with its substrate to produce a visible signal that can be measured.\niv. Competitive ELISA:  In competitive ELISA, the inhibitor \nantigen and the antigen of interest compete for binding to the primary antibody. Secondary labeled antibody and substrate are added. The final signal is inversely associated with the amount of the antigen of interest in the sample, meaning that the more antigen in the sample, the weaker the final signal.\nVI. ANTIBODY CROSS-REACTIVITY\nThe ability of the antibody generated against one antigen to react with another antigen is known as cross-reactivity. It occurs when two antigens have similar epitopes. Cross-reactivity is exhibited by polysaccharide anti-gens and bacterial or viral antigens which are identical to cell components of normal host. A and B blood group antigens have minor differences in the terminal residues of the sugars attached to these surface proteins. In a person with blood group A, serum antibodies are produced against the group B antigen, although the person has never been exposed to group B Figure 41.4\nDirect ELISA.

Binding of complements to pathogen-antibody complex destroys the pathogens through opsonization, perforation of the cell membrane of pathogens or by depositing the immune complexes in spleen for further clearance.\nC. Neutralization\nWhen a pathogen or toxin enters the body, antibodies are secreted which bind to pathogen or toxin and neutralize it (\nFig. 41.5 ). Diphtheria \nantitoxin is a neutralizing antibody which neutralizes the diphtheria toxin.\nD. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)\nPathogens are coated by antibodies and killed by effector cells having receptors for Fc region of these antibodies.\nVIII. Medical Perspectives \nA. Hypergammaglobulinemia\nIt is characterized  by the presence of excess of immunoglobulin in blood. It occurs in infections, chronic liver disease, \nautoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, and in multiple myeloma. It is detected by the presence of increased gamma band in serum protein electrophoresis.\nB. Autoimmune Disorders\nThese disorders occur due to the abnormal response of immune system against the host components. It is due to anti-\nbodies or T cells causing damage to host cell/organs/antigens. The possible mechanisms of autoimmunity include release of hidden antigens, cross-reacting antibodies or altered expression of MHC molecule. Autoimmune disorders may be organ specific like type 1 diabetes mellitus (antibodies, as well as T cells against pancreatic beta cells), myasthenia gravis (antibodies against acetylcholine receptors), pernicious anemia (antibodies against intrinsic factor or parietal cells of stomach) or it may be organ non-specific like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis and multiple scle-rosis in which antibodies affect multiple organs.\n 1.  Systemic lupus erythematosus:  SLE is an autoimmune disease in which organs and tissues are damaged by auto-\nantibodies and immune complexes. Most of the patients are women of childbearing age. Clinical features include fever, weakness, rashes and a characteristic butterfly rash on cheeks. Antinuclear and anti ds-DNA antibodies are commonly detected.\nC. Polyclonal Antibodies\nThese are antibodies synthesized from different clones of plasma cells, which are capable of binding to multiple epitopes \nof same or different antigens. They are produced by injecting the antigen several times to the animal which forms high titers of antibodies against the same antigen. Compared to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies are inexpensive and easy to produce. The disadvantages are high cross-reactivity and batch-to-batch variability.\n 1.  Diagnostic applications:  Since polyclonal antibodies can recognize several epitopes, they are used in the diagnostic \nassays and hemagglutination reactions. They are used in immunoassays like ELISA, Western blotting, immunohisto-chemistry and flow cytometry as secondary antibodies.\n 2.  Therapeutic applications:  The plasma of a person who has recovered from an infectious illness contains antibodies \nto the infectious agent. Such plasma can be transfused into an ill victim of that disease as a treatment. This is known as convalescent plasma therapy .\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   724 24-10-2020   12:14:09"

Antigens are \nclassified based on immunogenicity, source of antigen and on their ability to induce antibody formation. Immunogenicity of a substance depends on its size, nature, processing and presentation of an antigen, host genetic makeup, foreignness, and heterogeneity. Antibodies, produced by plasma cells, can coat the pathogens and prevent their attachment to cell or cause their clumping or make them vulnerable to phagocytosis or destruction by NK cells. Antibodies can also neutralize toxins before they can damage the cell. Immunoglobulins are of five types\u2014IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. IgM is involved in primary immune response and IgG is involved in secondary immune response. The heavy and light chains of immuno-globulins are coded by immunoglobulin genes located on different chromosomes. The gene segments of immunoglobulin gene undergo rearrangement during maturation of B cells to form functional Ig gene. Antibody diversity is facilitated by the presence of multiple V, D, J segments, their random combination, junctional flexibility, addition of P and N nucleotides and somatic hypermutation. Antigens are associated with the antibodies through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interac-tions or van der Waals interactions. Various immunological assays used for diagnostic purposes are based on Ag-Ab inter-actions. Autoimmune diseases occur due to reaction of antibodies and T cells against the host antigens, cells or organs. Monoclonal antibodies are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers and viral infections.D. Monoclonal Antibodies\nThese are antibodies synthesized from single clone of plasma cells which bind to one type of epitope. Monoclonal anti-\nbodies are synthesized by hybridoma technology . In this, plasma cells and myeloma cells are fused to generate hybrid \ncells (hybridoma) and hybridoma cells secrete monoclonal antibodies. The advantages of monoclonal antibodies are: high specificity since they bind to specific epitope of the antigen, minimal cross-reactivity and better quantification of proteins. Its disadvantages\u2014the production is expensive and time consuming which requires cell culture and purification techniques.\n 1. Applications of monoclonal antibodies\n a.  Diagnostic applications : Monoclonal antibodies are used in several diagnostic techniques like ELISA, Western blot-\nting and immunohistochemistry as primary antibody due to their specificity. It is also useful for detecting pregnancy, diagnosis of infections, detection of tumor antigens and estimating drug levels in the blood.\n b.  Therapeutic applications : Monoclonal antibodies are used in the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.\nE.  Bence Jones Proteins\nThese are light chains of immunoglobulins excreted in urine in multiple myeloma. Bence Jones proteins are detected by \nheat test. They precipitate at 40\u201360 \u00b0C. After 60 \u00b0C, the precipitate disappears. On cooling, the precipitate reappears.\nF. Waldenstr\u00f6m's MacroglobulinemiaIt is a malignancy of lymphoplasmacytoid cells that secrete IgM.

OVERVIEW OF INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY\nInnate immunity is a type of immunity which is involved in the prevention \nof the pathogen from entering the body before the occurrence of infection. It provides the first and second lines of defense mechanism (physical and chemical barriers being the first line and non-specific mechanisms such as phagocytes constitute the second line), and it eliminates the pathogen within few minutes to few hours after entering the body. It is mediated by the anatomical barriers and phagocytes. Even though it is nonspecific, innate immunity is considered as natural since it is present from birth. In contrast to innate immunity, adaptive immunity, also known as acquired immunity is developed after the host is exposed to foreign antigen. It is considered as the third line of defense mechanism in eliminating the patho-gens. It is mediated by lymphocytes.\nMost foreign antigens present at least few structural patterns that allow the \nbody to differentiate between self and non-self. These are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. They are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Many cells, like leukocytes, contain certain PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors. Further, the recognition is helped by unique specific T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors. Several such molecules help in identifying self from non-self in the body.\nII. FUNCTIONS OF INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nInnate immune system forms various barriers in the body, both phys-ical and chemical which prevent the entry of pathogens. It allows the immune cells to organize around the pathogens and eliminate them from tissues and organs through mediators like cytokines or through activation of complement proteins. It also presents the foreign antigen to immune Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Explain the functions and mechanisms of innate immunity\n\u2022 Discuss the mediators of adaptive immunity\u2022 Explain the concept of self and non-self\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   728 24-10-2020   12:14:09"

Some components of innate immunity, such as skin, epithelium and complement are always active, while others like neutrophils and macrophages provide immediate protection if first lines of defense are breached.\nA. Barriers of innate immune system\nThe host is protected from entry of pathogens through physical and chemical barriers. \n 1. Physical barriers:  The physical barriers include skin, mucosal \nlining of gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract, eyelashes and other body hairs. Epidermis (outer layer of the skin) contains kera-tinocytes, which are capable of producing peptides and cytokines which destroy the microorganisms. Sebaceous glands secrete fatty acids and create an acidic environment inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Desquamation of epithelial layer of skin, presence of sweat, peristalsis in gastrointestinal tract and ciliary movements of respiratory tract remove pathogens and prevent them from entering the body. Body fluids like tears, secreted by lacrimal glands located under the upper eyelid wash out pathogens entering the eyes. Saliva secreted from salivary glands washes over teeth and mouth and traps the infectious agents and removes them. Flushing mech-anism of urine prevents colonization of pathogens.\nThe blood-brain barrier prevents the entry of pathogens into central \nnervous system from blood. It is formed from the endothelial cells of the capillary wall and astrocytes surrounding the endothelial cells. Defect in blood-brain barrier in trauma, neurological disor-ders and epilepsy allows pathogens to enter brain resulting in brain infection. \n 2. Chemical barriers:  The presence of chemicals like enzymes and \nproteins in the body fluids play a role in the removal of pathogens. Lysozyme, a hydrolytic enzyme which is present in sweat, tears and saliva can degrade the pathogens by cleaving their cell wall. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid (HCl), mucus and enzymes which kills most of the microorganisms entering through food. Bacterial flora present in the gut also prevents the growth of harmful patho-gens. The presence of fatty acids, bile acids and lactoferrin are essential for the maintenance of normal gut flora and for preventing the entry of pathogens through mucosa.\n   Any breach in the physical barriers due to trauma, animal bite or \ninsect bite allows pathogens to enter the body, leading to infections which can spread to other parts of the body if not treated properly. Certain bacteria like Helicobacter pylori neutralize the HCl secreted by stomach and form colonies in stomach resulting in gastritis and gastric ulcer.\nB. Immune cells\nImmune cells form the second line of defense of innate immunity. It They consist mainly of phagocytes comprising neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 40). Phagocytes eliminate the patho-gens through phagocytosis.Barriers of innate immunity\nAnatomical barriers: Skin and \nmucous membranes\nPhysiological barriers:\nTemperature, chemical medi-ators (interferons, lysozymes, etc.), low pH\nPhagocytic barrriers: \nImmune cells (monocytes, macrophages)\nInflammatory barriers:\nSequence of events in response to invading patho-gens or tissue injury which leads to accumulation of fluid and phagocytic cells for clearing the pathogen.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   729 24-10-2020   12:14:09"

Here the \nphagocytic cell utilizes the protrusions of its cell membrane known as pseudopodia to engulf the bacteria and other pathogens (\nFig. 42.1 ).\n 1. Steps of phagocytosis a. Migration and chemotaxis of phagocytes:  It refers to the \nmovement of phagocytes from bloodstream to the site of infec-tion characterized by the presence of damaged tissues and pathogens. Neutrophils are recruited first at the site of infec-tion, and monocytes are converted to macrophages as the infection progresses. Chemotaxis is influenced by variety of inflammatory molecules like cytokines and cell adhesion mole-cules. Phagocytes bind to the endothelial cells and migrate to the site of infection through junctions in between the endothelial cells. After crossing the endothelium, phagocytes move along the concentration gradient of chemokines, towards the site of inflammation.\n b. Attachment to the surface of pathogens:  Phagocytes after \nchemotaxis, attach to the surface of pathogens through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and/or opsonins.\ni. Toll-like receptors:  TLRs are protein receptors, which \nare present on the membranes of phagocytes, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes. TLRs usually attach to the lipopolysaccharides or peptidoglycans in the cell wall of bacteria and nucleic acids of viruses leading to its activation. After activation, TLRs activate various signaling pathways leading to upregulation or downregula-tion of genes resulting in the production of cytokines, which initiate inflammatory responses causing either phagocytosis or lysis of the pathogen.\nii. Opsonins:  Opsonins are molecules which mark the patho-\ngens for phagocytosis. Opsonins include circulating proteins like collectins, antibodies and complements. The process of opsonization has been described in the Chapter 43, p. 747.\n c. Formation of phagosome:  After phagocytes are attached to \npathogens, the pseudopodia of phagocytes engulf the pathogen and it is internalized resulting in the formation of phagosome.\n d. Formation of phagolysosome:  Phagosomes combine with the \nlysosomes inside the cell leading to the formation of phagolyso-some, which is acidic in nature and it results in the activation of enzymes involved in the degradation of pathogens.\n e. Destruction of pathogen:  Destruction of pathogens occurs \nthrough oxygen-dependent or oxygen-independent mecha-nisms. Oxygen-dependent mechanism involves activation of enzymes like NADPH oxidase , myeloperoxidase  and genera-\ntion of reactive oxygen species (like superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) and reactive nitrogen species (like NO and peroxyni-trite). The oxygen-independent mechanism includes release of enzymes and proteins like lysozyme, lactoferrin and defensins.

Evasion of phagocytosis by pathogens:  Many pathogens can \nevade phagocytosis with the help of structural components or through other mechanisms. Microbes like Staphylococcus and Listeria can kill phagocytes by secreting a protein known as leuko-cidin or cytolysins, which make transmembrane pores, respectively and Streptococcus inhibits its attachment to TLRs through capsules and M proteins.\nIII. SOLUBLE COMPONENTS OF INNATE IMMUNITY\nApart from phagocytes, there are certain soluble factors which can mediate innate immunity. These soluble factors are proteins which are either expressed on innate immune cells or present in circulation. Some compo-nents like interferons (IFNs) and defensins are synthesized at the site where tissue is damaged and infected, whereas other components like comple-ments and acute phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP) are gener-ated at distant sites and reach the site of infection through blood.\nA. Acute phase proteins\nAcute phase proteins are plasma proteins whose concentration increases or decreases during acute phase of illness. CRP is one of the acute phase proteins which mediates innate immunity. It belongs to family of pentraxins. It is synthesized in liver and induced by cyto-kines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- \u03b1), interleukin-1 and -6. \nCRP binds to polysaccharides or phosphorylcholine on the surface of pathogens and promotes phagocytosis through complement activation.\nB. Interferons\nThese are glycoproteins secreted by various immune cells in response to infection by virus or tumors. They are also released by virus-infected cells which induce an antiviral response in other cells in the locality. These proteins were named as interferons as they interfere with the repli-cation of virus. They play a role in the regulation of immune response. There are three main types of IFNs.\n 1. Interferon- \ud835\udec2 (IFN- \ud835\udec2): It is secreted by macrophages. It plays a role \nin innate immunity. The main function of IFN- \u03b1 is to increase presen-\ntation of antigens and the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.\n 2. Interferon- \ud835\udec3 (IFN- \ud835\udec3): It is secreted by fibroblasts. Along with IFN- \u03b1, \nit mediates innate immunity. It is involved in the expression of class I MHC molecules. Interferon alpha and beta responses also help in mitigation of viral infections by inhibition of viral transcription and translation, and destruction of viral RNAs.\n 3. Interferon- \u03b3 (IFN- \u03b3): It is secreted by T helper cells/natural killer \n(NK) cells. It is mainly involved in adaptive immune response, where it differentiates T helper cells and activates NK cells. It is respon-sible for delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. IFN- \u03b3 increases the \ninflux of macrophages into the graft and mediates graft rejection.\nC.

It includes chemokines that induce migration of leukocytes to the site of infection and interleukins (ILs) which assist the communication between leukocytes, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFNs. They are secreted under the influence of various stimuli like stress and inflammation. Cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF- \u03b1 which are involved in innate immunity are secreted mainly by \nmacrophages, and cytokines like IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 which are involved in adaptive immunity are secreted by T cells (T\nH1 cells secrete IL-2 and \nIFN- \u03b3, TH2 cells secrete IL-4 and IL-5).\n 1. Mechanism of action:  Cytokines bind to the receptors of target \ncells and activate/inhibit the signal transduction pathways leading to the alteration in the expression of various genes of the target cells. Cytokines exert autocrine, paracrine or endocrine effect depending on the site of target cells. The actions of cytokines are either syner-gistic or antagonistic with other cytokines.\n 2.

ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY\nAdaptive immunity develops during the lifetime of the host. It differs from innate immunity as it is highly specific and associated with the develop-ment of immunological memory. Immunological memory is the ability of immune system to respond rapidly to pathogens that have been encoun-tered previously either through infection or vaccination.\nA. Types of adaptive immunity\nAdaptive immunity can be classified as active and passive immunity which are acquired either naturally or artificially. Active immunity is termed as natural if it is acquired through contact with the pathogen (infections) and artificial if it is acquired through vaccines which are developed from dead or attenuated pathogens or their components. Passive immunity is obtained through natural route by transfer of anti-bodies from mother to fetus through placenta (e.g., IgG) and IgA by breast milk or through artificial route by administration of gamma glob-ulins. Adaptive immunity can also be classified as humoral immunity if it is mediated by B cells through production of antibodies or cellular immunity if it is mediated by T cells.\nB. Mediators of adaptive immunity\nAdaptive immunity is mediated by B cells, T cells, antibodies and APCs.\n 1.

B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages are the major APCs which can activate a na\u00efve T cell. APCs are classified into two types\u2014professional and non-professional APCs. Dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells are professional APCs. Among the professional APCs, dendritic cells and B cells constitutively express class II MHC, while resting macrophages express them only mini-mally. Activated macrophages express high levels of major histo-compatibility complex II (MHC II) molecules. Only dendritic cells constitutively express costimulatory molecules. B cells and macro-phages have to be activated for expression of costimulatory mole-cules. Because of this, dendritic cells are considered the best APCs. Non-professional APCs (e.g., fibroblasts, glial cells, pancreatic beta cells, etc.) have to be induced to express class II MHC mole-cules. They are involved in antigen presentation for short duration. Dendritic cells are characterized by the presence of long protrusions known as dendrites and are distributed in circulation, skin, thymus and lymphatic vessels. Dendritic cells and macrophages ingest the pathogen, degrade it, transport it to lymph node and present it to T cells. B cells take up the antigen by endocytosis and present it to T cells.\n 2. Antibodies:  Antibodies can degrade pathogens through opsoniza-\ntion, neutralization and activation of complements (see Chapter 41).\n 3. T cell:  T cells provide the cell-mediated immunity. They are described \nin detail in Chapter 43.\nV. MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX\nMajor histocompatibility complex is a complex of genes that codes for proteins on the cell surfaces that help the T cells to identify the pathogens. The TCR recognizes the antigens presented with MHC and activates the T cell resulting ultimately in the elimination of the pathogen. In humans it is found on chromosome 6 and is known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. It participates in cellular and humoral immunity and is respon-sible for differentiating self from non-self antigens. There are three types of MHC molecules.\nA. Class I MHC molecules\nThese are expressed on all nucleated cells and are involved in the presentation of endogenous antigens to cytotoxic T cells. They contain an alpha ( \u03b1) chain which is linked noncovalently to \u03b2\n2 microglobulin, \nand this facilitates the expression of class I MHC molecules on the cell membrane. The \u03b1 chain is connected to the cell membrane and \ncontains three domains ( \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13). The \u03b13 segment serves as \nbinding site for CD8 molecule of cytotoxic T cells. The peptide-binding groove is formed between \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains and it binds to peptide \nwith 8\u201310 amino acids.\nB. Class II MHC molecules \nThese are expressed on APCs and are involved in presentation of exogenous antigen to helper T cells.

Class III MHC molecules \nThey are not related to class I and II MHC molecules and are not involved in antigen presentation. Class III MHC genes code for compo-nents of complements and heat shock proteins and are involved in inflammation.\nD. Regulation of MHC expression\nExpression of class I and class II MHC molecules are regulated by certain transcription factors and cytokines. Among cytokines, IFN- \u03b1 \nand TNF- \u03b1 upregulate the expression of class I MHC molecules. IFN- \u03b3 \nincreases the expression of class II MHC molecules by activating the transcriptional factors.\nReduced expression of class I MHC on the surface of cells leads to \nthe evasion of immune response by certain viruses. Hepatitis B virus, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus reduce the expression of class I MHC molecules by binding to \u03b2\n2 microglobulin, reducing the availability of \ntranscription factors and the components required for assembly of class I MHC molecules.\nVI. ANTIGEN PROCESSING \nEndogenous and exogenous antigens are presented to the T-cells using different pathways. \nA. Cytosolic pathway\nThis pathway is used for the processing endogenous antigens (e.g., peptides derived from viral proteins and cancer antigens) and then they are presented on the cell membrane with class I MHC molecule. \nIn cytosolic pathway, endogenous antigens meant for degradation \nare attached to ubiquitin. The ubiquitin-peptide complex are then degraded to smaller peptides by an ATP-dependent cellular machinery known as proteasome. Proteasome is induced by IFN- \u03b3 and TNF- \u03b1. \nThe degraded smaller peptides are transported to rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) through a carrier known as transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). TAP is a heterodimer, which is attached to RER. TAP contains ATP binding unit, and energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for the transport of peptide to RER. In RER, peptides interact with class I MHC. The interaction of MHC-I molecule with beta-2 microglob-ulin, as well as initial folding of MHC-I molecules are facilitated by chap-erones like calnexin and calreticulin. The class I MHC-peptide complex is transported from RER to cell surface through Golgi apparatus. \n[Note: Chaperones are proteins that facilitate folding and assembly of \nmacromolecules like proteins].MHC restriction\nIt is the property of T cells \nto recognize the antigens presented only by self MHC molecules. CD8\n+ T cells are \nclass I MHC restricted, while CD4\n+ T cells are class II MHC \nrestricted.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   734 24-10-2020   12:14:10"

Endocytic pathway\nThis pathway is used for the processing exogenous antigens (e.g., \nbacteria, virus, chemicals, etc.) and then they are presented on the cell membrane with class II MHC molecule.\nIn endocytic pathway, the exogenous antigens are trapped by APCs \nand internalized by either phagocytosis or endocytosis. The anti-gens which are internalized enter endosomes and move to lysosomes with gradual reduction in pH. In lysosomes, antigens are degraded by hydrolytic enzymes like proteases , nucleases , lipases and glycosidases . \nPeptide antigens bind with class II MHC molecules. Class II MHC mole-cules, after their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, contain a protein known as invariant chain which binds to peptide-binding cleft and prevent the binding of endogenous antigen. Invariant chain allows class II MHC molecules to enter endocytic compartment where the former gets degraded to form CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide) fragments. The CLIP present in the peptide binding cleft is exchanged with the exogenous antigenic peptide, and class II MHC-peptide is transported to surface of cell membrane (\nFig. 42.2 ).\nVII. ANTIGEN PRESENTATION\nIt is the process through which the processed antigen is presented to T cells in the form of short peptide fragments. The endogenous and exog-enous antigenic peptides, which are presented on the cell surface with class I and class II MHC molecules, respectively binds to T cells through TCRs leading to activation of T cells.

Medical Perspectives \nInflammation\nIt is a response induced by tissue injury or infection due to breach in the anatomical barriers by pathogens, or other \nforeign molecules. Inflammation is needed to destroy the pathogen, to prevent the spreading of infection and to repair the damaged tissue. Acute inflammation may occur due to tissue damage and indicates early infection. Chronic inflammation is due to persistence of the instigating cause of inflammation and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Inflammation is characterized by swelling (tumor), redness (rubor), heat (calor), pain (dolor) and functio laesa (loss of func-tion). Inflammatory response can occur in three stages. In the first stage, tissue injury leads to vasodilation mediated by histamine, kinins, leukotrienes and cytokines. Vasodilation leads to increase in blood flow which increases the warmness (heat) and redness in tissues. Increase in vascular permeability increases leakage of fluid from capillaries and its accu-mulation causing edema and swelling. In the second stage of inflammation, phagocytes stick to the vessel walls (margin-ation), traverse through the fenestrations in the endothelial cells, and migrate to the site of infection/injury and facilitate  \nphagocytosis. In the third stage of inflammation, tissue repair occurs by replacing the dead/damaged cells.\n[Note: Pus is due to accumulation of dead cells and body fluids. Abscess is due to formation of pus in the cavity after \ntissue damage].\n[Note: Chronic inflammatory disorders include connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, and disorders like \natherosclerosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that predominantly affects the synovial joints. Rheumatoid factors are antibodies against self IgG. The IgG-Rheumatoid factor complex deposit in joints, where they activate the complement cascade, leading to chronic inflammation. The disease can lead to joint destruction, deformity, and disability, and may also present with extra-articular manifestations.

Chapter Summary\nWhen a pathogen enters the body, two arms of immune system\u2014innate and adaptive immune systems act in eliminating \nit from the body. Innate immune system forms the first and second lines of defense, and adaptive immune system forms the third line of defense mechanism. Innate immunity components include anatomical barriers like skin and mucosa of GIT and respiratory tract (first line of defense) and phagocytic cells like macrophages and monocytes (second line of defense). Phagocytosis is the process of ingestion of pathogens by phagocytes. Innate immunity is induced by several soluble factors like IFNs, cytokines and acute phase proteins. Adaptive immunity develops after exposure to the antigen and consists of active and passive immunity which may be induced by either natural or artificial methods. The media-tors of adaptive immunity include B cells, T cells, APCs and antibodies. APCs present the antigens to T cells with the help of MHC molecules. MHC molecules are classified into class I and class II which are involved in the presentation of endogenous and exogenous antigens, respectively. Endogenous antigens are processed through cytosolic pathway and are presented to cytotoxic T cells (\nFig. 42.3 ). Exogenous antigens are presented through endocytic pathway and are \npresented to helper T cells. Any breach in innate immunity is associated with inflammation characterized by swelling, pain, redness and increased heat. Viral infections are associated with reduced expression of class I MHC molecules leading to evasion of virus from the immune system.treatment of inflammatory disorders as it reduces the synthesis of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins by inhib-iting the enzyme cyclooxygenase ].\nFever\nIt is a systemic response to infections characterized by high body temperature. Cytokines released during inflammation \nincrease the body temperature by elevating the hypothalamic temperature set point. The benefits of fever include abro-gation of optimal temperature for the growth of pathogens, increasing the rate of activity of metabolic enzymes, and increase in the immune response. However, extreme elevations in body temperature can lead to enzyme denaturation and hazardous effects.\nC-reactive protein\nCRP is an acute phase protein released in the early phases of inflammation against a wide range of acute and chronic \ninflammatory conditions. CRP binds to the phosphocholine expressed on surface of dead or dying cells and some bacteria. It activates the complement system, increases release of IL-6 and cytokines and promotes phagocytosis by macrophages.\nTherapeutic applications of interferons\nIFNs are glycoproteins released from virus-infected cells. They confer antiviral protection on neighboring cells and increase \nthe activity of cytotoxic T cells against tumors. IFN- \u03b1 is used in the treatment of melanoma, hepatitis, lymphoma and \nleukemia. IFN- \u03b2 is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and IFN- \u03b3 is used in the treatment of chronic granuloma-\ntous disease and osteopetrosis.\nDisease related to cytokines\nBacterial septic shock is caused by the endotoxins present in the cell wall of bacteria. The endotoxins stimulate the \nrelease of IL-1 and TNF- \u03b1, which cause early sepsis and IL-6 and IL-8, which are associated with late sepsis. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   736 24-10-2020   12:14:10"

Antibodies bind to the antigens of the pathogen and remove them by either opsonization-mediated phagocytosis or by degra-dation of the cells by activation of complements. Hence, humoral immu-nity is also known as antibody-mediated immunity. Humoral immunity is assisted by T helper cells and cytokines which play a crucial role in the production of plasma cells from B cells. In contrast to humoral immunity, cellular immunity is involved in the elimination of virus infected cells and cancer cells. Cellular immunity is mediated by T cells which recognize the antigens of the pathogen presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The cytokines secreted from T helper cells help in the activation of cytotoxic T cells and lysis of the infected cells.\nII. T CELLS (T LYMPHOCYTES)\nA. Types of T cells\n 1. T helper cells (Th cells):  Th cells play a role in the immune response \nby activating other immune cells. They are also known as CD4 cells, as they express CD4 glycoprotein on their surface. Th cells are involved in the maturation of B cells to plasma cells and memory cells. They are also responsible for activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. There are two types of Th cells. Th1 cells assist in phagocytosis and secrete cytokines like IL-2 and IFN- J. Th2 cells \nactivate B cells and secrete cytokines like IL-4, IL-10 and IL-5.\n 2. Cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells):  They are also known as CD8 cells, \nas they express CD8 glycoprotein on their surface. Their main role is to destroy tumor cells and cells infected by virus. They are also involved in transplant rejection. They are activated in lymph nodes Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Describe the cellular and humoral components of the immune system \n\u2022 Discuss the central role of T helper cells in immune response \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   739 24-10-2020   12:14:11"

They bind with antigenic peptides \npresented by class I MHC molecules and destroy their target cells by releasing perforin which creates pores in the membranes of infected cells and granzymes which cause apoptosis of tumor cells and viral infected cells.\n 3. Memory T cells:  They are termed as memory cells as they provide \nmemory to immune system for the infections acquired in the past, in a manner similar to memory cells of B lymphocytes. These cells persist for longer time after the infection is controlled. Re-exposure to same pathogens allows these cells to activate the immune system quickly and eliminate them. These cells may express either CD4 or CD8 and consist of central and effector memory cells.\n 4. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells):  They were previously known as \nsuppressor T cells as they suppress the cell-mediated immunity after the elimination of foreign antigen and maintain immune toler-ance. They also suppress autoreactive T cells that had escaped the negative selection in thymus (explained later in this chapter) and prevent the occurrence of autoimmune disorders.\nB. T cell receptor (TCR)\nTCR is a protein, present on the surface of T cells and involved in the recognition of MHC-peptide complex by T cells. It is a heterodimer and consists of two types of chains\u2014 \u03b1 and \u03b2 (95% of T cells) or \u03b3 and \u03b4 (5% \nof T cells). The \u03b1\u03b2 TCR is highly specific and plays a role in adaptive \nimmunity, whereas \u03b3\u03b4 TCR is mainly involved in innate immunity. TCR is \nmembrane bound, and its interaction with antigen is weak compared to antibodies. Binding of MHC-peptide complex to TCR activates T cells through several signal transduction molecules.\n 1. Structure of TCR:  \u03b1\u03b2 TCR consists of two chains, alpha and \nbeta linked by disulfide bridges. Both the chains have a variable \nregion , responsible for the specific antigen recognition by the TCR \nand constant region  which is involved in the attachment of TCR \nto the membrane. Below the constant region there is a connecting sequence, which connects two chains through disulfide linkage. Both the chains are attached to the plasma membrane through transmembrane region containing positively-charged amino acids. Each chain contains a cytoplasmic tail at C-terminal end. TCR is associated with another membrane protein known as CD3, forming a complex (TCR-CD3 complex). CD3 is essential for the expres-sion of TCR on the membrane and subsequent signal transduction (\nFig. 43.1 ).\n   TCR-CD3 complex is involved in the recognition of antigen-MHC \ncomplexes, and the interaction between TCR and MHC-peptide complex is enhanced by the presence of cell adhesion molecules and coreceptors like CD2, CD4, CD8 and CD28.\n 2. TCR gene rearrangement:  The genes of TCR are formed by rear-\nrangement of V, D and J segments similar to immunoglobulins. The \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains are formed by rearrangement of V and J segments, \nand \u03b2 and \u03b4 chains are formed by the rearrangement of V, D and J \nsegments. V-J and V-D-J joining during TCR gene rearrangement is catalyzed by recombination-activated genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) which is expressed on the early thymocytes.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   740 24-10-2020   12:14:11"

T cell development is predominant during fetal life and continues till puberty. T cell production declines after puberty owing to shrinkage of thymus. The hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow form lymphoid precursors which migrate to thymus and develop into T cells. In thymus, T cells are activated after exposure to antigens and are associated with several markers like CD2, CD4, CD8 and CD3 (\nFig. 43.2 ).\nThe development of T cell precursors into mature T cells involves \nalterations in:\n\u2022 TCR gene\u2022 expression of TCR protein, and\u2022 production of CD3 complex and coreceptors like CD4, CD8\nDuring early development, immature T cells lack CD4 and CD8 and \nthey are known as double negative (DN) cells.

These selection processes are mediated by thymic cells like dendritic cells, macrophages and epithe-lial cells and are essential to generate T cells which are MHC-restricted and self-tolerant. \n 1. Positive selection:  T cells which express both CD4\n+ and CD8+ \ncombine with MHC-peptide complex presented on the surface of cortical epithelial cells and get the signal for survival resulting in positive selection. Positive selection determines MHC restriction\u2014the ability of the TCR to bind with the self MHC molecules. Those T cells which cannot bind to MHC, or those that bind to the MHC with a high affinity are eliminated by apoptosis. Only T cells with intermediate affinity binding to MHCs are selected for further devel-opment. Helper T cells (CD4 cells) are formed in response to posi-tive selection on class I MHC, and cytotoxic T cells (CD8 cells) are formed due to positive selection of class II MHC. It was found by experimental studies that signals received through CD4 suppress CD8 gene resulting in the development of helper T cells and signals received through CD8 suppress CD4 gene resulting in the develop-ment of cytotoxic T cells. The T cells expressing only CD4 or CD8 are mature thymocytes.\n 2. Negative selection:  It occurs due to recognition by the T cells of \nself-peptides derived from host's own proteins, which are expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells. Negative selection is essential for developing tolerance to self-antigens (self-tolerance).\nD.

This signaling complex phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) leading to the acti-vation of transcription factors involved in the gene expression, activa-tion and differentiation of T cells.\n Activation of T cells is also facilitated by the presence of costimulatory \nsignals like CD28 on T cells and B7 molecules on the antigen-presenting cells. In the absence of costimulatory signals, T cells recognize peptide-MHC molecules but will not proliferate resulting in clonal anergy .\n 1. Immunological synapse:  It is a highly organized structure formed \nbetween T cells and antigen-presenting cells. It consists of a central region, which contains TCR-CD3 complexes interacting with the MHC-peptide complex, interaction of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28 with B7 on the APC), interaction of CD4 or CD8 with the MHC, and an outer region, which contains adhesion molecules like lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). It is crucial for the activation of T cells.\n 2. T cell differentiation to memory T cells and effector T cells:  \nExposure to foreign antigens activates T cells resulting in secre-tion of IL-2. IL-2 binds to its receptor causing proliferation and differentiation of activated T cells generating effector T cells and memory T cells. Effector T cells are involved in secretion of cyto-kines, and activation of B cells and cytotoxic T cells. Memory T cells are derived from both na\u00efve T and effector T cells after activation by antigens and generate secondary response against similar antigens.\nIII. B CELLS (B LYMPHOCYTES)\nA. Features\nThe features of B cells are described in the Chapter 40. The matura-tion of B cells occurs in bone marrow, where it acquires B cell receptors (BCRs). After maturation, B cells migrate to lymphatic organs/periphery and activates to form plasma cell/memory cell after exposure to B cell antigens.\nB. Functions of B cells\nB cells are mainly involved in humoral immunity, a component of adap-tive immunity. They secrete antibodies and eliminate the antigens by opsonization, complement activation or antibody-dependent cell-medi-ated cytotoxicity (ADCC). B cells are antigen-presenting cells and are involved in the presentation of antigens to helper T cells. They also secrete cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF- \u03b1, IFN- \u03b3, etc.\nC.

Cross-linking of membrane Ig molecules by antigen cause the interactions of cytoplasmic tails of Ig- \u03b1 and Ig- \u03b2, producing \nintracellular signal. The tyrosine residues in ITAM are phosphorylated and allow binding of signaling molecules which initiate signal transduc-tion after binding with antigen (\nFig. 43.3 ).\nD. B cell development\nThe development of B cells begins in the bone marrow. B cell is said to be matured if it expresses IgD and IgM on its membrane. After matura-tion, B cells move to periphery and convert to plasma cells or memory cells after exposure to antigens. Immature B cells that bind to self-anti-gens undergo apoptosis. About 10% of B cells reach maturity and exit the bone marrow.\nThe stromal cells of bone marrow send signals to lymphoid precursor \ncells which lead to combination of D-J segment on the H chain chromo-some to become early pro-B cells. Pre-B cells are formed by rearrange-ment of V segment of heavy chain genes. Light chain rearrangement leads to formation of immature B cells, which express  membrane IgM (mIgM) on the cell surface. Immature B cells leave the bone marrow. They are not functional yet, and exposure to antigen induces death or anergy. Transformation into mature B cells requires co-expression of IgD and IgM on the cell surface. These mature B cells undergo acti-vation and clonal selection forming plasma cells and memory B cells (\nFig. 43.4 ).\n 1. Regulation of B cell development:  B cell development is regulated \nby cell adhesion molecules like stem cell factor on the stromal cell membrane and CD117 on the lymphoid progenitor membrane, and cytokines like IL-7. Self-reactive B cells that are formed during the development can have three fates:\n a. Clonal deletion, when these cells undergo apoptosis.\n b. Receptor editing, when the B cell receptor is edited by RAG1/2 \nto render it non self-reactive.\n c. Clonal anergy, when the cells survive, but do not respond to \nantigenic stimuli.\n 2. B cell activation:  When an antigen binds to BCR it is internalized by \nendocytosis, and the antigen is processed and presented by class II MHC molecules on the surface of B cells resulting in the activa-tion of B cells. It requires helper T cells for its activation. Binding of MHC-peptide complex to Th cells activate it releasing cytokines which induce proliferation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells or memory cells.\n a. Memory cells:  These cells are formed from activated B cells \nand contribute to the immunological memory. These cells persist for a longer time and are found in abundance in spleen and epithelium. Memory cells are generated during primary immune response after infection or vaccination. Memory cells are identi-fied by the presence of cell surface marker, CD27. \n b. Plasma cells:  Plasma cells are formed from activated B cells. \nB cells undergo differentiation to form plasmablast, then proplas-macyte and finally plasma cells. Plasma cells secrete antibodies, and these antibodies reach the site of antigen through blood or Figure 43.3\nCross-linked B cell receptors after binding antigen.Cell membrane\nITAMIg\u03b2 Ig\u03b2\nIg\u03b1 Ig\u03b1ITAMImmunoglobulinAntigen\nP\nPP\nPP\nPP\nP\nFigure 43.4\nB cell development.Lymphoid\nstem cellPro-B cellIg\u03b1/Ig\u03b2\nPre-B cell\nImmature B cell\nMature B cell\nMemory cellPlasma cell\nSecond \nexposure\nto antigenRelease \nof \nantibodyBone marrow\u2013 Antigen independent Periphery\u2013 Antigen dependent Surrogate\nlight chain\nIgM\nIgM\nIgD\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   744 24-10-2020   12:14:13"

Plasma cells are identified by the presence of cell surface markers like CD27, CD138 and CD78. \nIV. PRIMARY IMMUNE RESPONSE\nIt is the response of the immune system when it comes in contact with the antigen for the first time. It occurs mainly in lymph node and spleen and results from the activation of na\u00efve B or na\u00efve T cells. In this type of response, the immune system is capable of recognizing the antigen and produces antibodies and/or activated T-cells against it. The primary response is influenced by various factors like adjuvants, nature of antigen and route of antigen administration. Here, immunity is achieved after few days of encountering antigen, known as lag phase. Antibodies are produced after 4\u20135 days and reach peak after 7\u201310 days. IgM is the predominant anti-body produced in primary response, but its affinity towards antigens is low (\nFig. 43.5 ).\nV. SECONDARY IMMUNE RESPONSE\nIt is the response of the immune system when it comes in contact with the antigen for the second or subsequent times. It occurs mainly in bone marrow followed by lymph node and spleen and results from the activa-tion of memory cells produced during the primary immune response. In secondary response, immunity is established quickly compared to primary response. Antibodies are produced within 1\u20132 days and reach peak at 3\u20135 days. IgG is the predominant antibody produced in secondary response (\nFig. 43.5 ). The antibodies have high affinity for antigens, and their levels \nremain higher for longer duration.\nVI.  CLASS SWITCHING OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS \n(ISOTYPE SWITCHING)\nIt is a process through which immunoglobulin production from B cells \nswitches from one heavy chain type to another. During primary immune response IgM is predominantly produced, and in secondary immune response IgM is changed to IgG type. During class switching, the constant region of heavy chains of immunoglobulins is changed, but the variable region does not alter. Hence the antigen specificity is not affected, but the effector activity of the antibodies varies resulting in rapid removal of patho-gens during secondary immune response. Class switching is facilitated by interaction between CD40 on B cell and CD40 ligand on helper T cells, and the presence of cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, IFN- \u03b3 and TGF- \u03b2.\nDuring the course of immune response against an antigen, there is an \nincrease in the affinity of antibodies towards the antigen. This is known as affinity maturation  and occurs due to somatic hypermutation in immuno-\nglobulin genes of B cells in germinal centers.\nVII.

Classical pathway:  It involves components C1-C4 and is activated \nby IgM and IgG. The Fc portion of IgM undergoes conformational changes after binding with antigen and activates C1q. C1q acti-vates C1s which cleaves C4 to C4b and C2 to C2a and C2b. C2a combines with C4b forming C3 convertase (C4b2a). C3 convertase hydrolyzes C3 to C3a and C3b. C3b combines with C3 convertase forming C5 convertase (C4b2a3b) which cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b combines with C6 to C9 forming MAC (\nFig. 43.6 ).\n 2. Alternate pathway:  It differs from classical pathway as it does \nnot require antibodies. Since antibodies are not involved, it acts like innate immune defense mechanism against pathogens. In this pathway, complements are activated by C3, factors B and D, and properdin. It is initiated by cell wall components of pathogens and tumor cells. In alternate pathway, C3 is spontaneously, but slowly, converted into C3a and C3b. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens and even the host cells. However, high levels of sialic acid present on the surface of human cells inactivate C3b. On the surface of pathogens, the molecule remains active, to continue the alternate complement pathway. C3b is cleaved further by factor D to form C3 conver (C3bBb). C3 convertase hydrolyzes C3 to C3b and forms C5 convertase (C3bBb3b). C5 convertase cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b combines with C6 to C9 forming MAC (\nFig. 43.7 ).\n 3. Lectin pathway:  Lectins are proteins that recognize and bind to \nspecific carbohydrate targets. Binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to mannose residues on glycoproteins or carbohydrates on the surface of microorganisms such as Salmonella, Listeria, and Neisseria activates this pathway. The lectin pathway also does not require antibodies for its activation.\nMembrane attack complex (MAC)\nIt is a complex structure formed by interaction of C5b with C6, C7, C8 and C9. Binding of C5b with C6 \nand C7 induces conformational changes in C8 which then interacts with plasma membrane of the patho-gens. C9, a perforin-like protein binds to C5bC6-C7-C8 complex and induces large pores in the membrane of pathogens, causing efflux of electrolytes and small molecules from the cell and influx of water into the cell. This causes osmotic imbalance and cell lysis.Figure 43.6\nClassical complement pathway.Ag\u2013Ab complex\nC1\nC1 + C4 C4b2aC4a\nC2b (C3 convertase)Activated C1\nC3 C4b2a3bC3a\n(C5 convertase)\nC6C7C8C9C5 C5bC5a\nMembrane attack complex\nFigure 43.7\nAlternate pathway.C3\nC3b\nC3bB\nC3bBb (C3 convertase)\nC3b\nC3bBb3b (C5 convertase)\nMembrane \nattack \ncomplexSpontaneous or cell wall \ncomponents of pathogen\nC5 C5b\nC6,7,8,9\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   746 24-10-2020   12:14:13"

            "Text": "VIII. Opsonization 747\nC. Regulation of complement activation pathway\nThe step catalyzed by C3 convertase is considered as the rate-limiting \nstep in all the three pathways. During complement activation, the host cell damage is less since C3b undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis. Also, regulator of complement activation (RCA) protein family which contain repeating motifs regulate C3 convertase enzyme.\nComplement activation is also regulated by other proteins. Classical \npathway is inhibited by C1 inhibitor (prevents C1 activation) and C4 binding protein (prevents formation of C3 convertase). Alternative pathway is inhibited by factor H (prevents formation of C3 convertase). All the three pathways are inhibited by decay-accelerating factor (disso-ciation of C3 convertase) and complement receptor type 1 (prevents formation of C3 convertase). MAC is inhibited by S protein which prevents insertion of MAC into cell membrane.\nD. Biological effects of complement activation\nActivation of complement enhances the defense mechanism against the pathogens. MAC mediates cell lysis; C3a, C4a and C5a mediate inflammation; C3b and C4b mediate opsonization and C3b is involved in the neutralization of virus (along with MAC) and clearance of antigen-antibody complexes. The complement system also causes neutraliza-tion of viruses by formation of larger viral aggregates, which reduces the net number of infectious viral particles. The binding of complement and/or antibody to a viral particle also blocks attachment to suscep-tible host cells.\nE. Evasion of complement-mediated defense mechanism by \nmicroorganisms\nGram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, etc.) \nand Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus) prevent insertion of MAC into cell membrane through lipopolysaccharides and peptidogly-cans, respectively in their cell wall. Elastase  inactivates factors C3a and \nC5a. Several proteins in virus and fungi mimic complement regulatory proteins and inhibit the activation pathways.\nVIII. OPSONIZATION\nIt is a process which uses molecules known as opsonins  to mark the \nforeign antigen for an immune response and eliminate them by phagocy-tosis. Opsonins can be antibodies like IgG, complement components like C3b and C4b, and proteins in circulation like pentraxins and collectins. Opsonins mark the apoptotic cells and pathogens for clearance by phago-cytes and activates complement pathways. \nOpsonization is mediated through Fc receptors and complement recep-\ntors which are present on phagocytic cells and bind to constant region (Fc) of immunoglobulins or complement components, respectively. Binding of Fc with Fc receptors, and C3b/C4b to complement receptors activate signal transduction that facilitates phagocytosis of immune complexes. After phagocytosis, the pathogens are destroyed through enzymatic diges-tion or by oxidative damage.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   747 24-10-2020   12:14:13"

ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELL-MEDIATED \nCYTOTOXICITY (ADCC)\nIt is a mechanism through which cytotoxic cells bind to target cells (e.g., \npathogens) through antibodies and destroy them. ADCC is mediated by macrophages, NK cells, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. These cells have Fc receptors, which bind to Fc region of immunoglobulins. Cytotoxic cells attach to target cells through antibodies and release their contents like lytic enzymes, perforin and tumor necrosis factor resulting in lysis of target cells.\nX. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS\nHypersensitivity reactions are inappropriate immune reactions to an antigen resulting in extensive tissue damage in the host. These reactions occur during humoral or cell-mediated immune response. If the symptoms mani-fest early (within minutes/hours) the reactions are known as immediate hypersensitivity, and if it manifests late after few days, they are known as delayed-type hypersensitivity. There are four types of hypersensitivity reactions.\nA. Type 1 (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity\nIt is induced by allergens like plant pollens, food items (nuts, seafood, milk, eggs, etc.), insect venom and drugs like penicillin and salicylates. Allergen exposure stimulates B cells to secrete IgE. IgE binds to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposure of the same allergen induces cross-linking of IgE causing degranulation of mast cells/basophils releasing histamine, cytokines, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These mediators increase vascular permeability, vaso-dilation and smooth muscle contraction resulting in rhinitis, asthma, anaphylactic shock and atopic dermatitis.\nB. Type II (antibody-mediated cytotoxic) hypersensitivity\nIt involves destruction of cells through antibodies. Antibodies can destroy the foreign antigens through activation of complements and creation of pores or through ADCC.\n 1. Transfusion reactions:  These reactions occurs when individual with \none type of blood group is transfused with blood of other group. For example, if a person with blood group A is given blood of group B, the anti-B antibodies (IgM) in recipient (having group A blood) bind to transfused blood cells and destroy them. The clinical features include fever, chills, backache, vascular collapse and detection of hemoglobin in urine.\nABO blood group showing distribution of antigens and antibodies is \ngiven in blue box below. \nBlood Group Antigens on RBC Serum Antibodies \nAA B\nBB AAB A+B NoneO None A+BGraft-versus-host (GVH) \nreaction\nIt is an immune reaction \noccurring in immunosup-pressed subjects who have undergone transplantation. GVH reaction develops when immune cells from the donor attack the recipient host tissue. It usually occurs when bone marrow is transplanted to patients with leukemia or immunodeficiency disorders. Since donor and recipient are not genetically identical, donor\u2019s immune cells which are present in the graft iden-tify the non-self MHC mole-cules in the recipient's organs and attack the host. The host cannot mount an immune response against donor\u2019s graft cells due to immunocompro-mised state (which preex-ists or is medically induced) before the transplantation.\nThe T cells from donors attack \nthe host since the host tissue act as foreign antigen against graft cells. The T cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines like IFN- \u03b3 and TNF- \u03b1 which \ninduces inflammation in host tissue leading to rejection of graft. GVH reaction may be acute if it occurs within 100 days of transplantation or it may be chronic if it occurs after 100 days. It is character-ized by clinical symptoms like diarrhea, skin lesions, jaun-dice and splenomegaly.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   748 24-10-2020   12:14:13"

On the other hand, individuals with type AB RhD positive blood are called universal recipients. (These are relevant only in emergency situations when appropriately cross-matched blood is not available.)\n 2. Hemolytic disease of the newborn (Erythroblastosis fetalis):  \nHere maternal antibodies (IgG) cross placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells due to their specificity for fetal blood group anti-gens. Erythroblastosis fetalis occurs commonly when mother is Rh\n\u2212 and fetus is Rh+. The first child is not affected since mother is \nnot exposed to fetal RBCs. During delivery, placenta is separated, and fetal cells enter maternal circulation and activate Rh-specific B cells producing Rh-specific plasma cells and memory cells. In the subsequent pregnancy, Rh antibodies are produced from activated plasma cells, which cross the placenta and destroy fetal RBCs. This condition can be treated by administering anti-Rh antibody to the mother at 28th week of gestation and within 72 hours of delivery.\nC. Type III (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity\nThis type of reaction occurs due to excessive formation of immune complexes. These complexes are deposited on the walls of blood vessel, basement membrane of kidney and synovial membrane of the joints. These complexes recruit inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and acti-vate the complement, which causes degranulation and releases their contents causing tissue damage. Immune complex deposition plays a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid disease, systemic lupus erythe-matosus, drug allergies and infections like meningitis and hepatitis.\nD. Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity\nIt is a localized inflammatory reaction induced by secretion of cytokines by activated helper T cells on contact with pathogens. The common pathogens involved are Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Candida albicans , \nHerpes simplex virus and measles virus. It has two phases\u2014sensiti-zation phase and effector phase. In sensitization phase, helper T cells (Th) proliferate and differentiate to Th1 cells after contact with antigens. In the effector phase, Th1 cells secrete cytokines like IL-3, IFN- J and \nTNF- \u03b1 which recruit macrophages. These macrophages are activated \nand present the antigens to T cells initiating delayed-type hypersensi-tivity reactions.\n 1.  Tuberculin test:  Type IV hypersensitivity is detected with skin test. \nTuberculin test is done to detect the exposure to M. tuberculosis. In this test, the purified protein derivative (PPD) antigen derived from the bacteria is injected subcutaneously and the inflammatory reaction is observed after 48\u201372 hours at the site of injection. The presence of swollen, firm lesion indicates previous exposure to the bacteria. The positive reaction indicates the presence of Th1 cells which are specific to the bacterial antigen.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   749 24-10-2020   12:14:14"

They manifest either as immediate reactions \n(within 1\u20136 h following drug intake) or delayed reactions (several hours to days later). It is very important to perform skin tests for sensitization to drugs known to cause such reactions such as beta-lactams (penicillin, oxacillin), immunoglobu-lins, contrast dyes, local anesthetics, etc.\n Some people are allergic to certain foods. Symptoms of a food allergy can occur within minutes to hours of ingestion. \nThey may include hives, itching, swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body, wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing. Some patients may also have abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. While any food can cause an adverse reaction, allergy to eggs, peanuts, shellfish and soy are common. \n The household dust may contain pet hair, mold or pollen spores, or dust mite (tiny creatures frequently found in furniture, \ncarpets, and bedding), all of which are common allergens. These allergens can cause an allergic reaction.\n Latex, a component of gloves, is also a known allergen. To avoid this allergy, latex-free nitrile gloves are now commonly \nused. Some people can develop allergy to cloth material, known as textile contact dermatitis. It is rarely due to fiber itself and more commonly due to chemical, such as dye, which are used to treat cloth fibers.\nPlasma Cell DisordersThese occur due to abnormal proliferation of B cells or plasma cell, forming a clone, which secrete excess of monoclonal \nantibodies or their fragments (light chain or heavy chain). These antibodies or their fragments are excreted in urine in the absence of renal dysfunction (overflow proteinuria). They account for 10%\u201315% of deaths from hematological malignan-cies. It includes monoclonal gammopathy, also known as paraproteinemia or dysproteinemia. Monoclonal gammopathy consists of several disorders like multiple myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, heavy chain disease and primary amyloidosis.\nMultiple myeloma:  It accounts for 1% of cancer deaths and is characterized by monoclonal proliferation of plasma \ncells with osseous and extraosseous manifestations. Vertebral column is commonly affected followed by ribs and skull. Presence of lytic lesions in long bones and punched-out lesions in skull are the common in multiple myeloma. The clin-ical features include bone pain and pathological fractures (extensive destruction of bones by malignant plasma cells), recurrent infections (suppression of humoral immunity) and renal failure (excretion of light chain causes tubular damage). It is diagnosed by the presence of M band (most commonly IgG or IgA) in the gamma region in serum protein electro-phoretogram and excretion of Bence Jones proteins in urine. Diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow examination which shows increase in plasma cells. \u03b2\n2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH) are used as prognostic markers in \nmultiple myeloma.\nXII. Chapter Summary\nHumoral and cellular immune systems are involved in the destruction of pathogens mediated by B and T cells, respec-tively. Development and differentiation of T cells occur in thymus. Immature T cells are converted to mature T cells by changes in (i) TCR gene, (ii) expression of TCR protein and (iii) production of CD3 complex and coreceptors CD4 and CD8. Positive selection of T cells in thymus ensures self MHC restriction and negative selection ensures T cells which react with self-antigens undergo apoptosis. The development of B cells occurs in the bone marrow and involves rearrangement of V-D-J genes. Mature B cells in the periphery express IgM and IgD on their surface and convert plasma cell or memory cell after exposure to antigens. Immature B cells that bind to self-antigens undergo clonal deletion, receptor editing, or clonal anergy. IgM is involved in primary immune response and IgG is involved in secondary immune response. Antibodies cause lysis of infected cells either through activation of complement or through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto-toxicity (ADCC) (\nFig. 43.8 ). Activated Th cells play a central role in both humoral and cellular immunity. Complement are \nactivated either by classical, alternative or lectin pathway. All the three pathways form MAC which creates pores, produces osmotic instability and causes cell lysis. Abnormal proliferation of plasma cells results in plasma cell disorders like multipl e \nmyeloma. Hypersensitivity reactions can be of type 1 (IgE mediated), type 2 (complement activation and ADCC by anti-bodies), type 3 (immune complex), type 4 (cellular, delayed).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   750 24-10-2020   12:14:14"

It could be attained naturally when a mother transfers the antibodies to fetus/infant via placenta or breast milk. Injection of preformed antibodies against a specific disease induces artificial passive immunity. In active immunity, body\u2019s own system is involved in producing the antibodies to fight a given infection. Active natural immunity is brought by clinical or subclinical infections. Administration of vaccines induces active artificial immunity.\nVaccine is the suspension of a weakened or killed microorganism or \nsubunit of a microorganism. Vaccines are administered to not only combat prevailing disease but also to protect the body from subsequent infec-tions. Vaccines are classified into six classes depending upon the nature of the pathogenic antigen and the technology used in its preparation. The antigen can either be the whole organism, its subunit, purified macromole-cule or DNA/gene responsible for the production of the antigen. The immu-nity induced by various vaccines varies from few months (cholera vaccine) to entire life (measles vaccine). \nII. IMMUNIZATION\nImmunization  is the process of inducing the body to develop resistance \nagainst a specific disease. Immunization can either be passive or active. \nA.

Passive natural immunization:  It is acquired from the mother \nbefore birth by the transfer of IgG antibodies via placenta and after birth by the transfer of IgA antibodies through breastfeeding.\n 2. Passive artificial immunization:  It provides quick protection \nagainst acute infections (e.g., measles, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepa-titis B, rabies, chickenpox, etc.) by injecting human or animal serum having already developed antibodies against a specific disease from which we want protection. Use of humanized monoclonal anti-bodies and antitoxins are also being made use of to provide passive artificial immunity.\nB. Active immunization\nIn active immunization, host immune system is induced to develop immunity. The immunity against a specific disease is obtained by acti-vating the immune system of an individual with administration of either the attenuated/inactivated form of the specific disease-producing organism or the toxoid responsible for producing that specific disease, or components of the agent causing infection (e.g., proteins, polysac-charides, or nucleic acids). Active immunization is done to provide long-term protection by inducing immunological memory. In active immunization, administered antigens cause proliferation of specific T and B lymphocytes resulting in the generation of specific memory cells. Active immunization is done under the following conditions:\n\u2022 To attain eradication or containment of a disease\u2022 To protect persons traveling to regions where certain communicable \ndiseases are endemic (e.g., yellow fever).\n\u2022 To protect armed forces against biological warfare\u2022 To prevent high-risk groups against diseases for which no treatment \nis available (such as rabies vaccine in animal handlers)\nIII. VACCINES\nVaccines act by inducing immunity against a specific disease-causing agent. Vaccines can either be given orally, administered by injection or applied locally on mucosal layers. Vaccines can be administered subcuta-neously (e.g., measles), intramuscularly (e.g., injectable polio vaccine [IPV]), orally (e.g., typhoid vaccine), intradermally (e.g., BCG vaccine) and intrana-sally (e.g., influenza vaccine), etc.\nIn brief, vaccines are used to stimulate immune system to fight disease-\ncausing agents and give protection from subsequent infections by creating specific memory cells.

Through vacci-\nnation, smallpox has been successfully eradicated worldwide, and polio \ncases have declined by 99%. Vaccines have also been developed for typhoid fever, cholera, plague, tuberculosis, pneumococcal infection, yellow fever, some types of encephalitis and typhus. \nB. Types of vaccines\nTo induce an immune response in the host, vaccines can either be prepared from the whole microorganism in its live, inactivated or dead form; part or subunit of the microorganism; purified products, obtained from the microorganisms which could either be proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, toxoids or the genetic material responsible for the production of the immune response. An ideal vaccine should have the following properties:\n\u2022 Produce sufficient immunity which lasts for a longer period and \nprovides long-term memory\n\u2022 Should be safe and have high degree of efficiency\u2022 Should have no or minimum requirement for the booster doses\u2022 Should be relatively cheap, easy to store and administer\nDepending upon the source used for their production, various devel-\noped vaccines can be categorized in the following types:\n\u2022 Whole microorganism vaccines Figure 44.1\nImmunity maintenance period of vaccines.Immunity Maintenance Period Vaccine\n6 months in children\n2 years in adultsCholera vaccine\n2 years TAB vaccine (typhoid-paratyphoid A \n& B vaccines)\n3\u20135 years Pneumococcal vaccine, Pertussis \nvaccine\n5\u201310 years Tuberculosis-BCG (bacillus \nCalmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine, diphthe-ria vaccine, Haemophilus in\ufb02uen-\nzae type-B vaccine\n10\u201315 years Mumps vaccine, varicella vaccine, \nyellow fever vaccine, tetanus toxoid\n>15 years Polio vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, \nrubella vaccine\nLifelong Measles vaccine\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   756 24-10-2020   12:14:14"

Vaccines 757\n\u2022 Purified pathogenic macromolecule vaccines/subunit vaccines\n\u2022 Synthetic polypeptide vaccines\u2022 DNA vaccines\u2022 Recombinant vector vaccines\u2022 Multivalent vaccines\n 1. Whole microorganism vaccines:  Most of the commonly used \nwhole microorganism vaccines have been created from the patho-genic bacteria or viruses by attenuating or inactivating these micro-organisms. Attenuation is done by growing the microorganisms under abnormal conditions for a prolonged period of time, while inactivation of microorganisms is done by either heat or chemical treatment. The attenuated or inactivated microorganisms retain their ability of inducing an immune response while losing their pathoge-nicity. These modified bacteria/viruses can induce immunity without causing the disease. Depending upon the modifications introduced, whole microorganism vaccines have further been divided into following two categories.\n a. Live, attenuated vaccines:  These are formed from weak-\nened microorganisms. Since they are very close to the natural pathogens, they end up creating a very strong and long-lasting immunity. Lifetime protection against a specific disease can be obtained by just one or two doses. Examples of attenuated vaccines having:\ni. Bacterial origin:  Tuberculosis (BCG vaccine), cholera \nvaccine and typhoid vaccine. \nii. Viral origin:  Measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, rubella \nvaccine, polio vaccine (Sabin), rotavirus vaccine, varicella zoster (chickenpox) vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. \n b. Inactivated/killed vaccines:  Vaccines using inactivated/killed \nmicroorganisms do not provide very strong immunity. During inactivation, it is absolutely essential to maintain active confor-mation of the epitopes. Heat treatment is usually not preferred as it causes extensive denaturation of proteins, hence, formal-dehyde or alkylating agents are often used to chemically inac-tivate the pathogen. Several doses of inactivated vaccine are required to maintain a desired level of immunity. Examples of inactivated vaccines having:\ni. Bacterial origin:  Anthrax vaccine, cholera vaccine, pertussis \nvaccine, typhoid vaccine and plague vaccine. \nii. Viral origin:  Hepatitis A vaccine, influenza vaccine, polio \n(Salk) vaccine, rabies vaccine.\n 2. Purified pathogenic macromolecule vaccines/subunit vaccines:  \nVaccines prepared from attenuated or inactivated whole microor-ganisms many a times cause complications/symptoms identical to the natural disease as sometimes the treated microorganisms revert back to their original form or if the inactivation remains inad-equate, leaving live organisms in the preparation. Vaccine-related encephalitis symptoms have been reported. Many vaccine-related complications can be avoided by preparing vaccines using puri-fied macromolecules from the pathogens.

            "Text": "758 44. Vaccines\nof vaccines prepared from purified macromolecules (inactivated \nexotoxins [toxoids], capsular polysaccharides and recombinant antigens) are currently being used.\n a. Toxoids:  Symptoms of many diseases like diphtheria and tetanus \nare produced by the exotoxins produced by the pathogenic microorganisms. Purified exotoxins obtained from the patho-genic microorganisms are inactivated and converted to their respective toxoid by treatment with formaldehyde. It is essen-tial to obtain detoxification of the exotoxins without inactivating the binding capacity of their specific epitopes. Sufficient quan-tities of the exotoxins are obtained by cloning the exotoxin gene and getting it expressed in a rapidly dividing host cell. Examples include diphtheria, tetanus and anthrax toxoid vaccines.\n b. Capsular polysaccharides:  Vaccines using the purified \ncapsular polysaccharides are based upon the principle that the hydrophilic nature of the capsular polysaccharides prevents the phagocytosis of the pathogens, and binding of their specific antibodies to these polysaccharides significantly enhances their rate of phagocytosis. Purified capsular polysaccharides have been used to prepare vaccines against Streptococcus pneu-\nmoniae, Neisseria meningitidis  and H. influenzae  type b (Hib) \nwhich are responsible for causing pneumococcal pneumonia, bacterial meningitis in all age groups and bacterial meningitis in children of less than 5 years of age, respectively.\n c. Vaccines from pathogenic bacterial proteins produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology:  Genes coding for surface \nproteins responsible for inducing immune response have been cloned and got successfully expressed in suitable host cells to produce large quantities of immunogenic proteins which are used to produce vaccines. Hepatitis B vaccine, prepared by recombinant DNA technology, was the first such vaccine to be approved for use in humans.\n 3. Synthetic peptide vaccines:  Despite a lot of initial excitement, \nvaccines from synthetic peptides have not picked the desired momentum. Main drawback of peptides, when compared to proteins, is that they are much less effective to induce the humoral and cellular immunological responses. Conjugates and adjuvants have been used with peptides to increase their protective immunity; however, such attempts have not yet been very successful.\n 4. DNA vaccines:  In DNA vaccines, the gene coding for the antigenic \nprotein of the pathogenic organism is directly inserted into the host cell via plasmid DNA. Perhaps by getting integrated into the host chromosomes, or by remaining as episomal DNA, the antigenic protein producing gene gets expressed, resulting in the production of a specific antigenic protein which in turn induces the body to give both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. DNA vaccines make the body\u2019s own cells as vaccine-making factories. DNA vaccines have following distinct advantages over the other forms of vaccines.\n\u2022 The antigenic protein is expressed in the host in their natural \nphysiological environment without undergoing any denaturation or any other structural modification.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   758 24-10-2020   12:14:14"

Vaccines 759\n\u2022 The immune response produced is an exact replica of the one \nproduced by the active pathogen.\n\u2022 DNA vaccines induce the production of both the humoral and \ncell-mediated immune responses.\n\u2022 The immunity induced by DNA vaccines stays for a prolonged \nperiod as large number of memory cells gets generated.\n\u2022 Same plasmid can be used to insert DNA coding for many \nproteins, resulting in simultaneous immunization against many diseases.\n\u2022 DNA vaccines are relatively easy to produce at much lower costs.\u2022 Requires no refrigeration, storage or transportation.\u2022 Significant improvement in the delivery system can be made by \ncoating with gold beads and using gene gun for their delivery. \n   After successful trials in animal model systems, human trials using \nDNA vaccines are in progress for influenza, herpes, malaria and HIV. Only disadvantage of the DNA vaccines being that these can only be prepared when the antigen is a protein. These cannot be prepared when the antigenic macromolecules are polysaccharides in nature.\n 5. Recombinant vector vaccines:  In principle, they are similar to \nthe DNA vaccines with the sole exception that an attenuated virus or bacteria is used as a vector to transfer the antigen-producing microbial gene to the host cells. Various microorganisms (vaccinia virus, canarypox virus, attenuated poliovirus, BCG strain of Mycobacterium bovis,  etc.) have been used for the production of \nvector vaccines. Usually, those microorganisms are used as vectors for vaccine production which have large genome (having hundreds of genes) because many genes can easily be inserted into them without affecting their ability of infection and replication in the host. These vaccines produce specific cytotoxic T cells, good immunity and long-lasting memory.\n 6. Multivalent vaccines:  Multivalent vaccines are being developed to \nsignificantly increase the immunogenicity of the polypeptide, protein or recombinant DNA vaccines. It is achieved by synthesizing a poly-peptide which has both the immunodominant B-cell and T-cell epit-opes. Delivery system plays an important role in the development of multivalent vaccines having multiple copies of a given peptide or a mixture of peptides. Following delivery systems have been devel-oped to deliver the multivalent vaccines to the immune system of the host.\n a. Solid matrix:  First, monoclonal antibodies are attached to the \nsolid matrix and then, the antibodies are saturated with the antigens. The antigens could be peptides, proteins, immuno-dominant epitopes for T and B cells, etc. The solid matrix-anti-body-antigen (SMAA) complexes thus produced are capable of inducing much vigorous humoral and cell-mediated responses resulting in the increased immunogenicity and much higher rate of phagocytosis.\n b. Liposomes:  Liposomes are also being used for the produc-\ntion of multivalent vaccines. Detergents are used to incorporate protein antigens into liposomes. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   759 24-10-2020   12:14:14"

Transfer of preformed antibodies, either naturally or artificially, is known as passive immunization. It provides immediate but short-lived protection. Active immunization induces the host immune system. This induction can occur naturally after exposure to pathogens or can be done artificially by using vaccines (\nFig. 44.3 ). Vaccines \ncan consist of whole microorganisms, their purified pathogenic macromol-ecules, synthetic polypeptides or DNA. Recombinant vector vaccines and subunit/multivalent vaccines are also available. Whole microorganisms can be live, attenuated or inactivated, killed. Live vaccines have the advan-tage of creating a very strong and long-lasting immunity. Whole organisms or their toxins or components can be inactivated by heat or chemicals to be used as vaccines. Some vaccines provide sufficient immunity with a single dose, while others require multiple booster doses. Adjuvants, such as alum salt, are also used to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.

Medical Perspectives\nImmunization is a key component of primary health care. Vaccines are one of the most successful health interventions \nwhich have significantly reduced incidence of infectious diseases and adverse health consequences. India's National Immunization Schedule (NIS) has been designed to protect children since birth, and at the ages when they are vulnerable to specific vaccine-preventable diseases.\nIndia has successfully eradicated smallpox (1977), poliomyelitis (2014) and maternal and neonatal tetanus (2015) by use \nof vaccines.\nIf a child has received initial doses but is brought late for a subsequent dose of multi-dose vaccines, the next dose should \nbe given, and the remaining doses should be completed at recommended interval as per the schedule.\nBesides the vaccines covered under the NIS, several other vaccines, such as against typhoid and human papillomavirus \n(HPV) are available in the market. \nCervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV. An effective and safe vaccine against HPV \ntypes 16 and 18, the two cancer-causing types of HPV, are available. Vaccination for girls before the age of 15 is recommended.\nDuring international travel, certain vaccines are recommended for protection against diseases endemic to the country of \norigin or of destination. Besides protecting the traveler, they also prevent disease spread between countries. Some coun-tries may also ask for proof of vaccination for travelers wishing to enter or exit the country. These include vaccines against meningococcal disease, tick-borne encephalitis and yellow fever.\nPeople who are immunocompromised due to diseases (HIV, cancer, etc.) or immunosuppressive medical treatment have \nan increased risk of infection. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are given to these patients to provide optimal protec-tion. Also, live vaccines are contraindicated in people who are severely immunocompromised as vaccine-related disease can be caused by unchecked infection.\nPeople who work in certain jobs may be exposed to high-risk diseases at work and should be vaccinated against such \ndiseases. Healthcare workers should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B and influenza. People who handle animals should be vaccinated against rabies.\nIndividual vaccination against a disease-causing pathogen can protect even those individuals in a community who have \nnot been vaccinated against that pathogen, a phenomenon known as \u201cherd immunity.\u201d This is only achieved when a very high proportion of community members are vaccinated, so it is difficult for the disease-causing organism, which spread by person to person transmission, to spread to unprotected persons.\nMaternally-acquired antibodies are critical to protect infants during initial months of life and immunization of pregnant \nwomen is important not only to protect mothers from infection, but also to provide natural passive immunity to infants.\nWorld Immunization Week is celebrated by the WHO in the last week of April (24 to 30 April) to promote the use of \nvaccines to protect people of all ages against diseases.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   762 24-10-2020   12:14:15"

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in metabolic, morphological, and many other aspects. Proto-oncogenes present in the normal tissues can be mutated to oncogenes or the function of tumor suppressor genes can be lost, leading to accumulation of mutations and subsequently, tumors. Genetic, environmental, physical, chemical or biological factors can predispose to cancer (Chapter 45).\n Human body is exposed to a number of foreign compounds, such as drugs, industrial chemicals, food additives, \nenvironmental pollutants, which can be harmful and therefore, need to be chemically altered to an excretable form. Such compounds, known as xenobiotics, are metabolized by specific pathways. Sometimes, compounds which are produced by metabolism of xenobiotics are more harmful than the original compound (Chapter 46).\n Oxidative stress can cause damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), protein and lipids. Antioxidants, which \ninclude enzymes and vitamins, can counter the effects of oxidants. Oxidative stress leads to various conditions like cancer formation, atherosclerosis and complications of diabetes mellitus. Toxicity due to oxidative stress is also used therapeutically, as in radiation treatment for cancer (Chapter 47).\n Specific organs perform specific functions. Evaluation of a specific analyte associated with a particular organ can \nhelp in diagnosing or monitoring a disease. Functioning of an organ can be evaluated by a group of investigations, known as organ function tests. A normal test does not rule out organ dysfunction, but an abnormal test almost always signifies underlying disease or dysfunction. These tests may involve assessment of metabolites processed by that organ or markers associated with injury to that organ. A group of analytes can also indicate the location of injury, such as BUN-creatinine ratio and fractional excretion of sodium for differentiating prerenal azotemia from intrarenal azotemia (Chapter 48).\n A primary healthcare physician must have the knowledge of common causes of oxidative stress and its effects \non health. Knowledge of cancer-causing factors is essential to promote reduction of exposure to such factors and for screening in predisposed population, which can reduce risk of cancer and its associated morbidity. Tumor markers are commonly used to detect or monitor progression or effectiveness of the therapy. Drugs which are metabolized through cytochrome P450 system can worsen the manifestations of porphyrias and this must be considered while prescribing such drugs. Also, the differences in xenobiotic metabolism can alter a person\u2019s response to a drug or its adverse effects. While evaluating a clinical condition, assessment needs to be made keeping in mind the affected organs and metabolic pathways to make a correct diagnosis. For example, in case of hyperbilirubinemia, excessive hemolysis results in prehepatic jaundice (increased unconjugated bilirubin), while defective excretion leads to posthepatic jaundice (increased conjugated bilirubin).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   768 24-10-2020   12:14:15"

Uncontrolled growth leads to tumors, which could either remain localized (benign tumors) or their cells could travel to different organs/tissues to cause malignancy. Uncontrolled growth and malignancy occur as a result of mutations in cancer-forming oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. Cancer-forming oncogenes are normally present in the body as inactive proto-oncogenes, whose conversion to oncogenes is also regulated by specific genes. Bioregulators which control the transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell bring about this change by acting either as growth factors or their receptors, stimulators of oncogenes or inhibitors of tumor suppressor genes. Specific substances either produced by their respective tumors or by the body in response to the presence of specific tumors are used as biomarkers to screen people for the presence of specific cancers or to monitor the tumor progression or the effectiveness of their thera-peutic process.\nII. INTRODUCTION\nUncontrolled growth of cells in tissues forms tumors. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Malignant tumors are designated as cancer. The term \u201ccancer\u201d is derived from the Latin word \u201ccancrum,\u201d meaning \u201ccrab\u201d and the cancer cells migrate to other tissues of the body like the feet of the crab. Fatality rate of cancer patients is second only to the patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Approximately 25% of all deaths in the world are due to cancer. In developed countries also, more than 20% of all deaths have been attributed to cancer. At the molecular level, cancer comprises a group of approximately 200 different diseases. Cancer tumors can be Learning Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: \n\u2022 Describe the differences between normal and cancer cells\n\u2022 Explain the characteristics of oncogenes and onco-suppressor genes\u2022 Discuss tumor markers with examples\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   769 24-10-2020   12:14:15"

They may also stop producing certain specialized proteins produced by specialized cells.\nB. Differences between normal and cancer cells\nCancer cells differ from the normal cells in the following processes:\n 1. Cell cycle time:  Normally the cell cycle consisting of G1, S, G2, \nand M phases is of 18\u201324 hours ( Fig. 45.1 ). Although the cell cycle \ntime stays the same in both normal and cancer cells, yet, in tumor cells the percentage of the cells in the dividing phase increases by 2\u20135 times. This difference helps us to develop cytotoxic drugs which can selectively kill the dividing cells without having any effect on the resting cells.\nG1 phase\n6\u201312 Hr2n DNAG0 Indefinite\nwithdrawal\nS phase\n6\u20138 Hr2\u20134 n DNAG2 phase\n3\u20134 Hr4 n DNA1 Hr\nMG0 Phase\nReactivation\nFigure 45.1\nCell cycle - Interphase is divided into G1, S, and G2 phases.

            "Text": "II. Introduction 771\n 2. Cell proliferation:  Proliferation coefficient is the ratio of the cells in \nthe dividing phase to the ones in the resting phase. Doubling time in tumor cells varies from 10\u2013450 days. With a doubling time of 100 days, malignant tumors may achieve a size of 1 cm in 8\u201310 years.\n 3. Morphological changes:  A normal cell becomes malignant after \nundergoing transformation. Malignant cells are morphologically different from normal cells. These cells are characterized by a large irregular nucleus, prominent nucleoli and scarce cytoplasm. Normal cells occur in monolayer, but the malignant cells have multilayered structure.\n 4. Contact inhibition:  Contact inhibition is a property of normal cells \nonly. When one set of normal multiplying cells comes in contact with another set of normal multiplying cells, further multiplication stops due to contact inhibition. For example, when a deep cut in the skin occurs, cells on both sides of the cut start multiplying to fill the gap. Further multiplication stops by contact inhibition, when the gap gets filled and multiplying cells from both sides come in contact. However, contact inhibition is lost in cancer cells.\n 5. Tissue adherence:  Normal cells adhere to other tissue cells with \nthe help of a protein called vinculin. During malignant transformation of cells, vinculin becomes inactive due to phosphorylation by tyro-\nsine kinase . Inactivation of vinculin decreases the adhesion ability of \ncancer cells resulting in facilitation of metastasis.\n 6. Role of sialylation:  A characteristic property of the cancer cells \nis that their surface is highly negatively charged due to its higher content of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA). Presence of negative charges on the surface of cancer cells prevents their adhesion. Role of sialidase and its inhibition in malignancy, opens the door for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of future.\n 7. Metabolic alterations:  Significant alterations in metabolic path-\nways occur as normal cells get transformed into cancer cells. Cancer cells metabolize sugars mainly by anaerobic glycolysis by eliminating the role of enzymes of citric acid cycle and mitochondrial electron transport chain. Production of several enzymes and proteins can also be altered.\n 8. Immortal nature of the cancer cells:  Cancer becomes immortal \ndue to inactivation of apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n 9. Metastasis:  Collagenase and stromelysin released by cancer cells \nhelp them pass through membrane barriers leading to migration. Migration usually takes place via blood vessels or lymphatics. Normal cells stay localized due to the presence of adhesion mole-cules. A significant decrease in important adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin, facilitates the migration of cancer cells. Cancer cells also have increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases. These enzymes help in migration of cancer cells by degrading the base-ment membrane proteins.\n 10. Angiogenesis in cancer:  Tumor cells, due to their rapid growth, \nneed extensive blood supply. Hypoxia is an important stimulant for neoangiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels).

Vascular endothelial growth factor by reacting with tyrosine kinase \nreceptors, present on the membranes of endothelial cells of blood vessels and lymphatic system, stimulate the multiplication of endo-thelial cells via specific signal transduction pathways. VEGF is upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), whose concen-tration increases manifold during hypoxia. Understanding the mech-anism of tumor angiogenesis assumes special significance because inhibiting angiogenesis can arrest tumor formation and its growth. \nIII. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER CELLS\nUncontrolled growth in cancer cells is due to mutations in the genes that regulate cell cycle and proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells (\nFig. 45.2 ).\nA. Oncogenes\nGenes responsible for the formation of the cancer are called onco-genes. Oncogenes are formed by mutation of proto-oncogenes present in normal tissues of the human body. Now approximately 100 proto-oncogenes are known which are responsible for controlling the growth, proliferation, and survival of the cells. These genes function by producing various growth factors, receptors for the growth factors, signal transduction proteins, various kinases  involved in activation/\ndeactivation of various proteins/enzymes and different transcriptional factors which regulate the rate of transcription. Proto-oncogenes get transformed to oncogenes by undergoing mutation in one allele of its gene or promoter. Oncogene formation is a result of a gain of a func-\ntion. Oncogenes are produced from normal cellular proto-oncogenes \nresponsible for producing growth-promoting proteins. Conversion of an inactive proto-oncogene to an active oncogene can be brought by the following mechanisms (\nFig. 45.3 ):\n\u2022 Mutations (point mutation, insertion, deletion)\u2022 Promoter insertion\u2022 Enhancer insertion\u2022 Chromosomal translocation\nProto-oncogenes are responsible for the production of various proteins \nwhich control various diverse processes. Oncogenes thus produced can be further activated by gene amplification. Proto-oncogenes and the diseases produced after their activation to oncogenes are enlisted below in \nFigure 45.4 . \nB. Tumor suppressor genes\nIn addition to oncogenes, malignant tumor formation is also controlled by the activity of tumor suppressor/onco-suppressor genes. These genes are responsible for inhibiting cell proliferation in response to various signals. In the process of transformation, mutation in the tumor suppressor gene makes them insensitive to the action of various signals. The loss of gene functions leads to malignancy. \nTumor suppressor genes are involved in controlling the production of \nspecific proteins which perform various functions.

Heredity:  Inherited high-risk factors (precancerous) play an impor-\ntant part at least in some types of cancers. For example, in some families, many women develop breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer, often at a younger than the usual age for these cancers. This is known as Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome (HBOC), caused by an inherited mutation in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.\n Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), adenomatous \npolyposis of colon (APC), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 mutations) and retinoblastoma (RB-1 mutations) also show hereditary risk.Proto-Oncogene & its Activation \nMechanism(s)Process Influenced by Pro-\nteins Produced by OncogenesOncogene-Associated Cancers\nCyclin D\u2014Translocation Amplification Regulation of cell cycle Breast, liver & esophageal cancers \nCDK4 \u2014Point mutation, Amplification Regulation of cell cycle Sarcoma & melanoma \nras\u2014Point mutation Signal transduction Lung, colon, thyroid, & pancreatic cancers\nakt2\u2014Amplification Signal transduction Ovarian cancer\nsrc\u2014 Overexpression Signal transduction Breast cancer\nraf\u2014Overexpression Signal transduction Myeloid leukemia\nsis\u2014 Overexpression Growth factors Osteosarcoma\nint-2\u2014Amplification Growth factors Breast & bladder cancers\nerb-B1 \u2014Overexpression Growth factor receptors Lung carcinoma\nerb-B2 \u2014Amplification Growth factor receptors Breast, ovary, lung & stomach cancers\nPDGFR \u2014Overexpression Growth factor receptors Myelomonocytic leukemia\nSMO \u2014Amplification Growth factor receptors Basal cell sarcoma\nHox11 \u2014Translocation Transcription factors T cell leukemia\nMyc\u2014Translocation Amplification Transcription factors Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Lung carcinoma\nFos, Jun \u2014Phosphorylation Transcription factors Breast cancer\nBcl-2 \u2014Translocation Apoptosis regulators Follicular B cell lymphoma\nRAR \u03b1\u2014Translocation Hormone receptors Acute promyelocytic leukemia\nNote: In this figure, name of proto-oncogene is written in small letters and italics ( ras, myc ) and its protein product capital, non-italics (Myc).\nFigure 45.4\nOncogene-associated cancers produced in human beings.\nFigure 45.5\nMechanism of tumor formation.Growth rate of cells increases by rapid multiplication Tumor is formed\nTumor suppressor genes get inactivatedProto-oncogenes Transformed to oncogenes\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   775 24-10-2020   12:14:34"

Environmental factors:  In approximately 80% of human cancer \ncases, various environmental factors discussed below play a signif-icant role in the development of cancer. \n a. Lifestyle\ni. Cigarette smoking:  Aromatic hydrocarbons, nicotine, \ncarbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide present in the ciga-rette smoke are responsible for developing lung cancer. Smoking 10 cigarettes per day increases the chance of occurrence of lung cancer by at least 15 times. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) is responsible for detox-ification of various chemicals present in smoke. Persons deficient in this enzyme are much more susceptible to the occurrence of cancer. \nii. Tobacco chewing:  Oral cancers in human beings have \nbeen attributed to tobacco chewing. In India, 20% of oral cancers are due to tobacco chewing.\niii. Alcohol consumption: Increases the chance of occurrence \nof oral, pharyngeal, esophageal and liver cancers.\niv. Dietary:  Certain fungus, such as Aspergillus flavus, which \ngrows on rice, wheat and other grains under humid condi-tions, produce aflatoxin, a potential hepatocarcinogen. Fungus growing on the cattle fodder enters the human system with the intake of cow\u2019s milk. The consumption of infected grains can lead to formation of liver cancer.\nv. Occupational:  Exposure to asbestos, benzene, naphthyl-\namines, beryllium, etc. predisposes the human body to the formation of various types of cancers.\nvi. Therapeutic drugs:  Use of some therapeutic drugs lead to \nthe formation of liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers.\nB. Mutagens\nAny substance which by damaging DNA causes mutation is called a mutagen. Substances which by enhancing the rate of mutation convert a normal cell to a cancerous cell are called carcinogens. All carcino-genic substances are mutagenic. Mutagens can be physical, chemical or biological/viral in nature.\n 1.

Increase in the exposure time and decrease in the quantity of melanin, increase the chances of occurrence of skin cancer. Exposure to UV light causes cancer primarily by forming pyrimidine dimers and secondarily by immunosuppression.\n c. X-rays and \u03b3-rays:  They can also induce mutations by radiation \nenergy with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/free radicals, e.g., OH\n\u2212, superoxides, etc. \n   Particulate radiations by \u03b1-particles and neutrons are highly carci-\nnogenic. Occurrence of higher incidence of leukemias in Japan after atomic attack, higher incidence of lung cancer in miners working in radioactive ore mines, and development of thyroid cancer in kids after exposure of their necks to therapeutic radiations provided experimental evidences that ionizing radiations can lead to malig-nancy of specific organs/tissues.\n 2. Chemical carcinogens:  It has been established that more than \n75% of the human cancers are primarily due to their exposure to chemicals. A well-documented groups of chemicals, with specific examples are enlisted below:\n\u2022 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzopyrene, \ndimethylbenzanthracene)\n\u2022 Aromatic amines (2-acetylaminofluorene, \nN-methly-4-aminoazobenzene/MAB)\n\u2022 Nitrosamines (dimethylnitrosamine, diethylnitrosamine)\u2022 Therapeutic drugs (alkylating agents, e.g., cyclophosphamide, \ndiethylstilbestrol)\n\u2022 Naturally occurring compounds (dactinomycin, aflatoxin B\n1)\n a. Mechanism of action of chemical carcinogens:  Chemical \ncarcinogens cause mutagenesis by either directly acting upon their targets (DNA, RNA, proteins of expression) as carcino-gens or these compounds act as procarcinogen and have to be converted to active carcinogens by the enzymes present in the human body. Carcinogens act like \u201celectrophiles,\u201d i.e., defi-cient in electrons, and they act by binding to the \u201cnucleophiles\u201d i.e., electron-rich nitrogen and oxygen atoms present in bases of DNA, RNA or amino acids of expression proteins.\ni. Mechanism of procarcinogen activation:  Enzymes of \ncytochrome P450\n system present in the endoplasmic retic-\nulum (ER) of the liver are primarily responsible in converting an inactive procarcinogen to an active carcinogen.\nii. Mechanism of action of carcinogens:  Most of the chem-\nical carcinogens act by covalently binding to either the atoms present in the bases of DNA/RNA molecules or to their phosphodiester bonds. The adduct product thus formed causes mutation by wrongly pairing with the base of the complementary strand of the DNA during replication. \nFigure 45.6  demonstrates that how binding of dimethylni-\ntrosamine to DNA results in damaging the DNA structure. Normally guanine pairs with cytosine; however, methylgua-nine pairs with thymine during replication resulting in mutation.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   777 24-10-2020   12:14:34"

Mechanism of action of DNA viruses:\n Viral DNA gets inte-\ngrated in the host genome without completing its replicative cycle. The viral genes which have been transcribed earlier produce specific proteins which act on the host genome. Proteins produced by the viral genome modify the regula-tory checks and balances of the host genes resulting into their transformation and occurrence of malignancy.\n b. RNA viruses:  All RNA viruses are retroviruses. Their RNA first \ngets converted to DNA by reverse transcriptase before insertion into the host genome. Examples include:\ni. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV):  It causes leukemia/\nlymphoma in human beings, which is endemic in Japan. Viral \u201ctat\u201d gene produces proteins which are responsible for causing transformation. Recently, a \u201cTax\u201d protein produced by HTLV has been shown to cause blood cancer leukemia in human beings by reacting with the Tax BP2 protein produced by the human genome.\nii.

Receptors are usually transmembrane proteins, with both external and cytoplasmic domains. Cytoplasmic domains have kinase \nactivity. \nBoth the growth factors and their receptors can become oncogenic under \nthe influence of specific mutations, and the increased concentration of growth factors and/or their receptors leads to the proliferation of the cells resulting in the formation of malignant tumors.\nClassic example is that of PDGF which binds to its receptor and through \nphospholipase-inositol triphosphate-diacylglycerol system, activates cellular MYC and FOS genes, which in turn stimulates mitosis. \nA. Mechanism of action of growth factors\nGrowth factors behave like hormones and may act by either of the following ways:\n 1. Endocrine:  Their site of action is different from the site of their \nproduction. They are carried to the site of action from their site of production via blood.\n 2. Autocrine:  Their sites of action and production are same.\n 3. Paracrine:  From the site of production they are secreted to the site \nof action.\nVI. CANCER AND APOPTOSIS\nApoptosis occurs normally during development and aging to maintain cell populations in tissues. Apoptosis also occurs as a defense mechanism against the damaged tissues. Such damage could have been caused by radiation, toxins, free radicals, inactive growth factors, hormones, T cells of the immune system, etc. Apoptosis involves the participation of a cascade system of various enzymes and proteins. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death and differs from necrosis which is not genetically controlled and unlike apoptosis its products are not automatically removed and cause local inflammation.\nA. Mechanism of apoptosis\nApoptosis is very tightly regulated and consists of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Apoptosis occurs in two phases, i.e., initiation and execution.\n 1. Phases of apoptosis\n a. Initiation phase:  The extrinsic pathway starts with binding of \nthe ligands (tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 [TNF- \u03b1] and Fas) to the \ndeath receptors present on the cell surface. Death receptors are proteins, and some of these can also bind to death domain of adapter proteins (FAS-associated protein with death domain [FADD]). Intracellular events (e.g., oxygen loss, damaged DNA, and various mutations) activate the intrinsic pathway, which cause changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n b. Execution phase:  It involves action of cysteine protease  called \ncaspases which act by breaking the peptide bond between aspartate and cysteine amino acid residues of proteins. Caspases are present in the form of large molecular weight inactive procaspases. Few important growth factors \nwith their function are mentioned below:\n\u2022  EGF: Stimulates growth of \nepidermal and epithelial cells\n\u2022  Erythropoietin (EPO): Regu-\nlates early erythropoietic cell development\n\u2022  Fibroblastic growth factors \n(FGFs): Promote cell proliferation\n\u2022  Interleukins: Act by \ninfluencing the activity of immune system\n\u2022  Nerve growth factor (NGF): \nActs on neurons\n\u2022  PDGF: Stimulates growth of \nmesenchymal and glial cells\n\u2022  Transforming growth factor- \u03b1 \n(TGF- \u03b1): Acts like EGF\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   781 24-10-2020   12:14:35"

Anti-apoptotic members also by binding to cytoplasmic Apaf inhibit the formation of apoptosome complex. The mecha-nism of apoptosis is summarized in \nFigure 45.8 .\nB. Cancer cells are anti-apoptotic\nCancer cells are immortal because they have developed mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis. The normal balance between pro- and anti-apop-totic systems is disturbed as the former gets inhibited and the latter gets overexpressed. The most commonly mutated gene in various cancers is p53, which causes upregulation of the antiapoptotic factors while downregulating the proapoptotic factors.\nVII. CANCER AND METABOLISM\nDuring DNA sequencing of 21 different tumors, many mutations in the impor-tant metabolic enzymes were observed. Otto Warburg and his colleagues discovered that as compared to the normal cells, cancer cells utilized more glucose and produced lactic acid. It is now established that cancer cell utilizes glucose mainly anaerobically resulting in the production of lactic acid. Anaerobic glucose utilization takes place as many tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enzymes become inac-tive due to mutation in their genes.

In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA and stim-ulates another gene to produce a protein called p21. When p21 is complexed with cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2), the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division.\nMutant p53 is unable to bind DNA \neffectively, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made. Thus cells divide uncontrollably, and form tumors. Mutations in p53 are found in most tumor types. However, when one copy of mutated p53 is inherited, person is at a very high susceptibility for development of several indepen-dent tumors in different tissues in early adulthood. This rare condi-tion is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   783 24-10-2020   12:14:35"

Alterations in pyruvate kinase, \nphosphofructokinase, glutaminases, hexokinase II, phosphoglycerate dehy-drogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, lactate dehydro-genase , etc. are associated with many cancers.\nVIII.  ROLE OF OXIDATIVE STRESS \nIN CARCINOGENESIS\nOxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between production and \ndestruction of various ROS, free radicals and their reactive metabolites. The oxidative stress causing damage to DNA by various reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) has been found to play an important role in the initiation and progression of the process of carci-nogenesis. Damage to the skin by various environmental factors, damage to the internal organs and the aging process all have been directly or indi-rectly linked to the action of ROS and RNS resulting from the oxidative stress. Under normal conditions in living cells, excessive ROS and RNS are destroyed by various antioxidant mechanisms present in the body. (See Chapter 47 for details of oxidative stress and antioxidant mechanisms.) In normal cells, low-level concentrations of ROS and RNS are required for signal transduction before they get destroyed by various antioxidant mechanisms prevalent in the body. High concentrations of ROS and RNS species help the cancer cells to maintain their high metabolic rate which is essential to provide required energy for cell proliferation. Monitoring the concentration of ROS and RNS and developing various ways to regu-late their concentration assume clinical significance to not only study the progression of the malignant tumors but also to develop various diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nIX. ROLE OF miRNAs IN CANCER\nMicro RNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules which play an important role in carcinogenesis by controlling the transcription and/or translation of some of the important proteins involved in tumor formation or the process of apoptosis. Some miRNAs act as tumor suppressor by hydrolyzing specific mRNA species involved in coding the important carci-nogenic or antiapoptotic proteins. In many cancerous conditions, specific miRNA species are downregulated. \nX. TUMOR OR ONCOGENIC MARKERS\nTumor markers are the specific biomolecules, detected in blood, body fluids, cell membranes or in cytoplasm, which are either produced and subse-quently released by the cancer cells or produced by the body in response to the presence of cancer cells. They can either be specific ions, proteins, enzymes or hormones. Tumor markers are physically and chemically different from the normal body constituents. Tumor markers are used to:\n\u2022 Detect the presence of the specific cancers \u2022 Monitor the progression of the disease\u2022 Monitor the effectiveness of the therapy\u2022 Detection of the site of specific tumor by using antibodies against their \nspecific tumor markers\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   784 24-10-2020   12:14:35"

Using the immunohistochemical analyses, cellular skeletons, lymphocyte surface antigens, cytoplasmic markers, oncogene products and cell adhesion molecules can be detected in tissue biopsies.\nXI. CANCER TREATMENT\nTherapy used for the management of cancer depends upon the type of cancer and the class it belongs to.\nSurgery and radiotherapy are the most commonly employed tools that are \neffective in destroying the cancer cells. These are very effective against solid cancers.\nChemotherapy is most effective in the management of leukemias, advanced \nlymphomas, choriocarcinomas and some other soft tissue malignancies. Chemotherapy is often supplemented by radiotherapy or surgery of the primary cancers. Surgery can also be followed by chemotherapy or radio-therapy to manage residual tumors. Chemotherapy acts by inhibiting cell division and their multiplication. It is most effective where the doubling time of the tumor is very high. Its effectiveness is inversely proportional to the size of the tumor. Cytotoxic drugs arrest the activity of both the cancer cells and the normal human cells in the dividing phase. Cell destruction follows the first-order kinetics, i.e., drug dose-dependent destruction is propor-tional to the percentage of cell and not on their number. Based upon their chemical structure and the mechanism of action, various anticancer drugs can be classified into 11 classes as shown in \nFigure 45.9 .\nAn ideal tumor marker\n An ideal tumor marker must satisfy the following criteria:\n\u2022 Method of its detection should be simple and cost-effective.\u2022 It should have high tumor specificity and sensitivity.\u2022 It should be detectable in early stages to provide a lead-time over clinical diagnosis.\u2022 It should have short half-life to allow frequent serial monitoring of the marker levels.\u2022 The levels of the marker should correlate reliably with the tumor size/volume.\n It is important to note that some of the biomolecules detected in cancer patients can also be detected in \npersons under non-cancerous conditions also. For example,\n\u2013  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein present in patients having cancer of prostate gland. \nPSA has also been shown to be present in persons having prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\n\u2013  Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), has not only been found in patients having various types of cancers \nbut in persons having ulcers of colon, liver cirrhosis and people smoking more than 5\u201310 cigarettes per day.\n  It thus becomes important that when specific biomolecules are used as biomarkers to detect the pres-\nence of cancer, results obtained must be confirmed by other tests such as biopsies and imaging tech-niques (Appendix Unit X: Tables 1 and 2).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   785 24-10-2020   12:14:36"

Lung, prostate, colorectal, \nstomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.\n30\u201350% of cancers can be prevented by avoiding risk factors, early detection of cancer and management of patients who \ndevelop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated adequately. Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer, accounting for approximately 22% of cancer deaths. Besides tobacco, being over-weight or obese, having unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, alcohol use, exposure to radiations and pollution are important preventable risk factors.\nVaccination and screening programs are effective interventions to reduce the global burden of specific types of cancer, \nsuch as against human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer and against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that causes liver cancer.\nCervical cancer can be prevented by screening women through population-based programs. Screening aims to detect \nthe disease at the precancer stage, using various approaches such as visual inspection with acetic acid or Lugol\u2018s iodine, Papanicolaou test (Pap test or Pap smear) and HPV DNA testing. In many of the developed countries, the annual inci-dence and mortality from this cancer have reduced by 50\u201370% since the introduction of screening programs.\nPatients with advanced cancers may suffer a lot due to cancer progression and also due to co-existing diseases, and \nside effects of cancer treatment, which are physical, psychosocial and emotional. These lead to poor quality of life, and palliative care is provided to such patients to improve the quality of life through the prevention and relief of suffering by early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems\u2014physical, psychosocial and spiritual.\nHow is it made sure that a drug or a product (e.g., cosmetics, preservatives) intended for human use is not mutagenic, \nand does not predispose to cancer? To test this possibility, drugs or similar products are subjected to a versatile testing process before marketing\u2014though it dates back to 1970s, Ames test still finds its use (\nFig. 45.10 ). This test uses a strain \nof Salmonella typhimurium which is defective in histidine synthesis, due to mutations in genes involved in histidine biosyn-thesis. Since the bacteria require histidine for growth, they do not multiply and form colonies when grown on growth media deficient in histidine. If the bacteria form colonies in presence of the chemical being tested, this indicates that the chemical has caused mutations in the previously mutated genes involved in histidine synthesis, reverting their function to normal. Thus, presence of bacterial colonies denotes the potential of the chemical to cause mutations. A modified version of the test uses a rat-liver extract which is added to the chemical. This modification allows the detection of a chemical which can cause mutations as a result of bioactivation.\nFigure 45.10\nAmes test.

Approximately 100 oncogenes have been identified. Oncogenes are produced from proto-oncogenes. Fifty proto-oncogenes are known. Proto-oncogene to oncogene conversion, i.e., gene transformation is brought about by amplification, translocation, and action of various mutagenic agents. Mutagens can either be physical, chemical, biolog-ical (DNA and RNA viruses) or radiation/ionization based. Hereditary and lifestyle (cigarette smoking, tobacco chewing alcohol consumption, etc.) and occupation act as important predisposing factors. Oncogenes thus are the mutated version of proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins which stimulate cell division, inhibit cell differentiation, and inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death). These processes are absolutely essential for normal human development and main-tenance of organs and tissues; however, when these get highly stimulated and become uncontrollable then the normal cells become cancerous. Cancers of lung, stomach, colon, liver, breast, and prostate account for approximately 20% of all deaths occurring the world over. The above transformation is brought by the action of various growth factors, growth factor receptors, gene translocation, and insertion of promoters or enhancers. The genes affected are cancer-forming genes (oncogenes), tumor suppressor genes, and genes responsible for programmed cell death (apoptosis). Occurrence of malignancy is a net manifestation of the stimulation of oncogenes and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes, and the genes controlling apoptosis (\nFig. 45.11 ). Specific biomolecules, detected in blood, body fluids, cell membranes or in cyto-\nplasm, which are either produced and subsequently released by the cancer cells or produced by the body in response to the presence of cancer cell are called as tumor markers. Tumor markers are used to either detect the presence of specific cancers, their progression or the effectiveness of the therapy. Therapy for the management of cancer can either be surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Therapy strategies are based upon the type of cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents employed are either vitamin/amino acid/bases analog, or the inhibitors of expression of oncogenes or stimulators of the tumor suppressor and apoptotic genes.\nFigure 45.11\nKey concept map of carcinogenesis.Exogenous carcinogens Endogenous carcinogens\nTumor  supressor  genes\nOncogeneProto\u2013oncogene\nDNA repair  defects\nCell cycle  progression,  \ncell growth  and \nproliferation\nInhibition  of \napoptosis\nTumor  formationUnrepaired  mutationsMutation Mutation\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   788 24-10-2020   12:14:36"

OVERVIEW\nThe human body is exposed to a large number of chemical substances that \nare extrinsic or foreign to the normal chemical environment and metabolism of our cells. Examples of such chemical entities include food additives and preservatives, pollutants, environmental toxins, pharmacological agents, dyes, detergents, synthetic polymers, cosmetics, biocides (like insecti-cides, herbicides, antimicrobials), etc. \u201cXenobiotic,\u201d the collective term used to denote such exogenous molecules is derived from the Greek words xenos  meaning stranger and biotic meaning related to life. Any chemical \nentity is toxic when the cells are exposed to them in supraphysiological quantities and/or duration and/or physical states. The human body metab-olizes xenobiotics to render them nontoxic and prevent their accumulation. This is achieved by a series of enzymatic reactions termed as biotransfor-mation. Hepatocytes play a central role in the process, though a number of these enzymes are present in most of the tissues. A sound knowledge of the metabolism of xenobiotics is important in understanding pharmacology, toxicology, cancer biology and the advancing field of pharmacogenomics (explained later in Section VI. Pharmacogenomics and personalized medi-cine, p. 800). This chapter covers various aspects of xenobiotic metab-olism\u2014the enzymatic reactions involved, effects of biological variations in the activity of these enzymes, rationale for the clinical management of certain drug toxicities, and other related clinical aspects.\nII.  METABOLISM OF XENOBIOTICS INVOLVES \nDISTINCT PHASES\nMost hydrophilic molecules cannot cross the lipid barrier created by the \nplasma membrane, unless there are specific carriers that are present to transport them into the cell.

Further, \nthey have a propensity to cross the membranes, to enter the cell and mediate toxic effects, and to accumulate in lipid-rich tissue sites like organ-elle membranes and adipocytes. Thus, for elimination from the body, lipo-philic molecules are first rendered hydrophilic, and are then transported out of the body through urine or bile (and ultimately in feces) (\nFig. 46.1 ). Thus,  \nthe purpose of xenobiotic metabolism is to convert such lipophilic mole-cules into a hydrophilic form that can be excreted.\nXenobiotic metabolism involves multiple steps. In phase 1 reactions, lipo-\nphilic molecules are transformed into relatively hydrophilic molecules by exposing or generating a polar group; some xenobiotics are excreted soon after the phase 1 reactions. However, many xenobiotics undergo the subsequent phase 2 reactions, where the products of phase 1 reactions (or sometimes, the xenobiotics as such) are conjugated with molecules (like glutathione, glucuronic acid, etc.) making them further hydrophilic. This facilitates their transport outside the cells via various transporter proteins. In certain cases, there can be additional chemical modifications, like further conjugation reactions, of the products of phase 2 reactions, before extruding the metabolites out of the cell\u2014these are termed as phase 3 reactions. The phase 1, 2 and 3 reactions together form what is also termed as biotransformation. If the xenobiotic is a drug, the study of its metabolism and excretion is the part of a field known as pharmacokinetics. \nIn case of orally administered drugs, certain amount of the drug absorbed \nfrom the intestinal lumen is inactivated by the enzymes present in the small intestinal epithelial cells. The remaining unaltered drug reaches the liver via the portal circulation, where the hepatic xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes act on some or most of the drug. Thus, only a portion of the orally admin-istered drug reaches the systemic circulation and is available to the target tissues due to the biotransformation in intestines and liver. This is termed as \u201cfirst-pass effect.\u201d More of the drug gets metabolized during the subse-quent \u201cpasses\u201d through the liver, until it is completely metabolized and elim-inated. If the first-pass effect significantly reduces the availability of a drug to the target organs, routes other than oral administration are considered. This is known as parenteral ( para: away, enteral : intestines) administra-\ntion, and examples include intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous administration of drugs.\nAlthough the intended purpose of xenobiotic metabolism is the inactivation \nand elimination of these molecules, sometimes biotransformation results in the activation of the molecule. This process, termed as bioactivation, has clinical implications. An inactive or minimally active form of a drug\u2014known as prodrug\u2014can undergo biotransformation to generate the active pharmacological agent. For example, codeine is a drug which is used in the management of pain. Codeine undergoes phase 1 biotransformation reaction to form morphine, which binds to its receptors to bring about this pharmacological effect; codeine as such cannot bind to these receptors with high affinity. Bioactivation is also responsible for activation of procar-cinogens. The reactive molecules that are generated by this process form adducts with DNA so as to introduce mutations, leading to carcinogenesis (see Chapter 47, Section III.A. DNA damage, p. 809). This is exemplified by benzo[ a]pyrene, a polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), present in tobacco \nsmoke. Benzo[ a]pyrene, a procarcinogen, undergoes a series of phase 1 \nbiotransformation reactions to form benzo[ a]pyrene-diol-epoxide derivative \nwhich forms adducts with deoxyguanine in DNA, leading to mutations and an increased risk of lung cancer.\nFigure 46.1\nFate of xenobiotics in the body.Xenobiotic\nHydrophilic\nLipophilicAccumulation \nin membranes/ \nadipose tissue\nPhase 2 \nBiotransformation \nExcretionBioactivationPhase 1 \nBiotransformation\nHydrophilicPhase 3 \nBiotransformation \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   792 24-10-2020   12:14:37"

Phase 1 Reactions Render the Xenobiotics More Hydrophilic 793\nApart from their actions on xenobiotics, the enzymes and reactions involved \nin biotransformation are also involved in metabolism of certain endogenous molecules. Bilirubin is conjugated with UDP-glucuronic acid to form hydro-philic bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin) to facilitate its excretion. This is similar to certain conjugation reaction involved in phase 2 of biotransformation. The first step in conversion of choles-terol to bile acids for excretion is its oxidation mediated by the enzyme 7-\u03b1-hydroxylase . This enzyme belongs to a family of hydroxylases involved \nphase 1 reactions (see Chapter 23, Section V.B, p. 347). A similar enzyme, 1-\u03b1-hydroxylase , is involved in activation of vitamin D to form 1,25-dihy-\ndroxycholecalciferol or calcitriol. The first step in the \u03c9-oxidation of fatty \nacids (see Chapter 21, Section IV.C. Peroxisomal \u03b1-oxidation, p. 312) is \nalso catalyzed by a member of the same group of enzymes.\nIII.  PHASE 1 REACTIONS RENDER THE XENOBIOTICS \nMORE HYDROPHILIC\nPhase 1 biotransformation reactions either expose polar groups in the \nxenobiotics, or add new ones to them, so as to make the xenobiotics more hydrophilic. The products that are sufficiently hydrophilic are excreted, but more often the phase 1 reactions generate intermediates that are ready to undergo subsequent phase 2 reactions. Phase 1 reactions include hydrox-ylation, dehydrogenation, hydrolysis, etc. The enzymes catalyzing phase 1 reactions are localized mostly, but not exclusively, to the microsomes.\nAmong the phase 1 reactions, the most prominent ones are hydroxylation \nreactions, and the most studied enzymes involved in hydroxylation reac-tions belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily.\nA. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily\nA superfamily of genes/proteins is a set of large number of genes/proteins that have been formed evolutionarily as a result of gene dupli-cations. They usually share a common protein domain but have other-wise diverged to such an extent that their functions are nonoverlapping. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes are hemoproteins which are present in all the nucleated cells of the body. The highest concentrations are found in liver, followed by intestines and kidneys. \u201cP450\u201d refers to the wavelength of 450 nm at which CYP enzymes absorb maximum light in vitro, when the heme (Fe\n2+) of these enzymes \nare bound to carbon monoxide. There are at least 57 functional CYP genes in humans and they are responsible for the metabolism of 50% to 70% drugs that are currently in use, apart from their role in metabo-lism of other xenobiotics. \nThe cytochrome P450 enzymes bring about their action by hydroxyl-\nation reactions. The general reaction catalyzed is:\nAH + O\n2 + NADPH + H+ \u2192 AOH + H 2O + NADP+\nThe oxygen molecule to be incorporated to the substrate is activated \nby its binding to the Fe2+ of the heme prosthetic group of the CYP \n(Fig. 46.2 ). One of the oxygen atoms is added to the substrate (AH) to \nform AOH; hence the reaction is called hydroxylation. The other oxygen atom gets protonated by H\n+ associated with NADPH to be released as \nwater. Two electrons that are required for the reaction are also derived from one molecule of NADPH. Since only one oxygen atom is added to the substrate, the enzymes are also known as monooxygenases . As Microsomes are fragments \nof endoplasmic reticulum that are produced during high-speed centrifugation after the disruption of the cells. Undoubtedly, they are not present in living cells. Hence, it is to be understood that all the enzymes that are mentioned to be micro-somal are actually a part of the endoplasmic reticulum in the living cell.\nFigure 46.2\nReaction mechanism of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases .Substrate\nProductA\u2013H\nA\u2013H\nA\u2013HP450-Fe3+\nP450-Fe3+\nP450-Fe2+\nA\u2013HP450-Fe3+e\u2013e\u2013\ne\u2013O2H2O\nO2\nA\u2013OHNADPH + H+  NADP+\nP450-Fe3+\nO2Cytochrome P450\nreductase\ne\u2013\nNADPH + H+ NADP+Cytochrome P450\nreductaseFAD, FMN\nFAD, FMN2 H+\n\u20132\u2013O\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   793 24-10-2020   12:14:37"

Xenobiotics\nthe oxygen atoms have two different fates\u2014getting incorporated into \nthe substrate and getting protonated to form water\u2014the enzymes are also known as \u201cmixed-function oxidases.\u201d\nSince there are large number of enzymes in the cytochrome P450 super-\nfamily, a systemic nomenclature is in place to unambiguously name the individual members (and their genes), and to identify their similarity with each other. For example, let us consider the phase 1 biotrans-formation reactions of benzo[ a]pyrene and codeine mentioned in the \nSection II. Metabolism of xenobiotics involves distinct phases. Benzo[ a]\npyrene is oxidized to benzo[ a]pyrene-diol-epoxide derivative by a cyto-\nchrome P450 enzyme known as CYP1A1; codeine is converted to morphine by another cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP2D6. Thus, the enzyme names have a root \u201cCYP\u201d followed by three more characters\u2014a number, followed by an alphabet and another number (\nFig. 46.3 ). The \nfirst character denotes \u201cfamily\u201d; if the amino acid sequence of two CYP enzymes are >40% similar, they are included in the same family. The second character represents \u201csub-family,\u201d where the members share >55% amino acid sequence similarity. The final letter represents the individual enzymes. Thus, CYP2D6 is the sixth member of family 2 and subfamily 2D. The genes coding for the cytochrome P450 enzymes are named after the respective enzymes, but with the names in italics\u2014e.g., CYP2D6 enzyme is coded by CYP2D6 gene.\nMany of the CYP genes show polymorphisms (see Chapter 39, \nSection VI. Restriction fragment length polymorphism, p. 682), i.e., a particular CYP gene with one or more nucleotide variants can exist in the population. For example, most of the population have \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cwild-type\u201d CYP2D6 ; their CYP2D6 enzyme will have \u201cnormal\u201d activity. \nAbout 10% of the individuals have nucleotide variants of CYP2D6  that \nresult in a decreased enzyme activity. In these individuals, administra-tion of codeine for pain relief will show suboptimal effects. They are termed as poor metabolizers. The nomenclature of CYP genes some-times also include the alleles present (\nFig. 46.3 ). CYP2D6*1/*1 repre-\nsents two copies of the wild type allele , CYP2D6*1/*4 represents a wild \ntype allele ( *1) and a variant allele ( *4), and so on. Interestingly some \nallelic variants lead to increased CYP enzyme activity. For example, individuals with CYP2D6*2/*2 metabolize codeine to morphine rapidly \nand show increased pain relief with codeine administration. They are termed as ultra-rapid metabolizers. Whether poor metabolism or ultra-rapid metabolism is of any advantage or disadvantage depends heavily on the clinical context. In case of a drug with severe adverse effects, poor metabolism leads to persistence of the drug in the body, increasing the risk of adverse effects. In another scenario, increased activity of CYP1A1 leads to increased conversion of benzo[ a]pyrene to mutagenic \nintermediates. 10% of the population with such allelic variants are at a higher risk of lung cancer when exposed to cigarette smoke.\nThough the number of CYP genes are only close to 57, the CYP \nenzymes are involved in the phase 1 biotransformation of thousands of molecules. Thus, these enzymes have a broad substrate specificity and most of them catalyze the metabolism of more than one xeno-biotic. Despite the fact that the basic reaction catalyzed by CYP is monooxygenation, they can mediate a large number of reaction types. Revisiting the previously cited example, CYP2D6-mediated monooxy-genation of codeine (which is chemically methylmorphine) results in its O-demethylation to form morphine:\nAO-CH 3 + O 2 + NADPH + H+ \u2192 AOH + HCHO + H 2O + NADP+Root term indicating \nCytochrome P450 superfamily\n(CYP)(2)(D)(6)[1*/1* ]Family:\n> 40% amino acid sequence similarity\nSubfamily:\n> 55% amino acid\nsequence similarity\nIndividual enzyme Alleles\nFigure 46.3\nNomenclature of cytochrome P450 \nenzymes. \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   794 24-10-2020   12:14:38"

Phase 1 Reactions Render the Xenobiotics More Hydrophilic 795\nOther reaction types catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes include \nN-demethylation, deamination, S-oxidation, N-oxidation, dehalogena-tion, epoxide formation, etc. Though most of the xenobiotics are inac-tivated by these processes, some of others undergo bioactivation, examples of which has already been mentioned.\nOf the 57 CYP genes, 50 encode CYP enzymes that are localized to \nthe endoplasmic reticulum (or microsomes), and these are primarily involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The other seven genes code for CYP enzymes that are localized to the mitochondria, and these are expressed by tissues like adrenal cortex, testes and ovaries, placenta, liver and kidney. Their reaction mechanism is similar to their microsomal counterparts\u2014they catalyze hydroxylation reactions\u2014but they require an iron-sulfur protein known as adrenodoxin for the electron transport from NADPH to the Fe\n2+ of heme in the CYP . Their substrate specificity \nis also limited. Some of the reactions catalyzed by the mitochondrial CYP enzymes include:\n\u2022 Steroidogenesis (see Chapter 23, Section VII.A, p. 360) to form \nhormones like estrogens and progesterone (in ovaries and placenta), testosterone (in testes), and glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (in adrenal cortex).\n\u2022 Most of the steps in conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (remember \nthat the rate-limiting step is catalyzed by 7-\u03b1-hydroxylase which is a \nmicrosomal enzyme\u2014see Chapter 23, Section V.B, p. 347).\n\u2022 Hydroxylation of vitamin D in the liver by vitamin D 25-hydroxylase \nto form 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol.\nB. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for certain \ndrug-drug interactions\nEnzyme induction refers to the increased synthesis of an enzyme, in \nresponse to presence of another molecule known as enzyme inducer. This occurs mostly at the DNA level, where the enzyme inducer leads to increased transcription of the gene coding for the enzyme, leading to increased mRNA and hence, protein levels. The opposite happens in enzyme repression. Many drugs (and other xenobiotics) act as inducers or repressors of CYP enzymes, thus determining the level and thus, overall activity of these enzymes. If a particular drug (or xenobiotic), say \u201cX,\u201d can induce or repress a CYP enzyme which is involved in the metab-olism of another drug, say \u201cY ,\u201d coadministration of drugs \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d to a patient may result in untoward effects due to increased or decreased metabolism of \u201cY .\u201d This can lead to suboptimal pharmacological effects or toxicity, as the case may be. Two such scenarios are explained below: \n\u2022 Drug components in many oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are metab-\nolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. St. John\u2019s wort, a common herbal preparation used in alternative medicine induces this enzyme. If females who are on oral contraceptives consume St. John\u2019s wort, the metabolism of the OCPs is accelerated, which might result in contraceptive failure and unwanted pregnancies (\nFig. 46.4 ). \n\u2022 Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant used in the treatment and preven-\ntion of thromboembolism. It is metabolized by CYP2C9, which is inhibited (or repressed) by amiodarone, a drug used in the treat-ment of arrythmias (\nFig. 46.4 ). Since some arrythmias can predis-\npose to thromboembolism, warfarin is often coadministered with antiarrhythmic drugs. But patients who are on amiodarone should be carefully monitored if warfarin is coadministered, as amiodarone Figure 46.4\nExamples of induction and repression of CYP enzymes.Inactive InactiveOral contraceptive pills\nSt. John\u2019s \nwort\nAmiodarone CYP2C9CYP3A4Warfarin\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   795 24-10-2020   12:14:38"

Other phase 1 reactions\nApart from the microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases , phase 1 \nreactions are also catalyzed by certain other enzymes.\n\u2022 Flavin-containing monooxygenases  (FMOs), like CYP enzymes, are \nmicrosomal enzymes with highest tissue expression in liver. They catalyze NADPH- and O\n2-dependent hydroxylation reactions. Unlike \nCYP enzymes, they are not subjected to xenobiotic-mediated enzyme induction or repression.\n\u2022 One of the effects of monooxygenation by CYP enzymes is the \nformation of epoxides. Epoxides are highly reactive and form DNA and protein adducts, resulting in carcinogenesis. An example of benzo[ a]pyrene-diol-epoxide has already been mentioned in \nSection III.A, p. 793. Thus, it is crucial to catabolize these epoxides, and these reactions are carried out by epoxide hydrolases . Epoxide \nhydrolases can be microsomal or cytoplasmic. They convert epox-\nides to dihyrodiols, by addition of a water molecule (\nFig. 46.5 ).\n\u2022 Two of the dehydrogenases  involved in phase 1 biotransformation \nreactions are explained in Section III.D, p. 796. \nD. Ethanol is metabolized by three distinct enzymatic \nreactions related to phase 1 biotransformation\nSmall amount of ethanol is produced in the body as a result of metabo-\nlism and bacterial fermentation in the intestines. Whether present in the body as a result of metabolism or because of ingestion, ethanol is first oxidized to acetaldehyde, and then to acetate. Acetate is converted to acetyl CoA by the enzyme acyl CoA synthetase, which is then oxidized in the citric acid cycle (\nFig. 46.6 ). The first step\u2014conversion of ethanol \nto acetaldehyde\u2014can be catalyzed by three different enzymes, each present in a different subcellular location (\nFig. 46.6 ):\n1. The major enzyme involved in the catabolism of ethanol to acetalde-\nhyde is alcohol dehydrogenase . It is a cytoplasmic NAD+-dependent \nenzyme, predominantly present in liver.\n2. Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) is predominated \nby CYP2E1. This enzyme is induced by ethanol. Since CYP2E1 is also involved in activation of some procarcinogens in diet and tobacco smoke, increased consumption of alcohol can predis-pose to cancer. Oxidation of ethanol by MEOS also produces reactive oxygen species which result in hepatocellular injury (see Chapter 47, Section III. Oxidative stress and biological effects of cellular oxidants, p. 809).\n3. Peroxisomal oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde mediated by \ncatalase is a minor pathway, accounting for less than 5% of ethanol catabolism.\nAcetaldehyde generated as a result of the above reactions forms \nadducts with numerous cellular proteins, resulting in cellular dysfunc-tion. Toxicity caused by acetaldehyde is one of the reasons for alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis in chronic alcohol consumption. Elevated acet-aldehyde levels also cause cutaneous vasodilation and increased skin Figure 46.5\nExample of reaction catalyzed by epoxide hydrolases .Epoxide \nhydrolase\nNaphthalene \n1,2-epoxideO OH\nOH\nNaphthalene \n1,2-dihydrodiol+H2O\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   796 24-10-2020   12:14:38"

Like CYP enzymes, ALDH also has poly-\nmorphic variants. Majority of Asians have an enzyme variant with low activity. This predisposes these individuals to long-term adverse effects of acetaldehyde; not to mention, they are also susceptible to bad hang-overs! Pharmacological inhibition of ALDH by disulfiram is used in the \ntreatment of alcohol use disorder. In a patient who is on disulfiram, intake of ethanol leads to accumulation of acetaldehyde and immediate development of symptoms of hangover. So, disulfiram is used to ensure abstinence from alcohol. \nMethanol, the lesser homologue of ethanol, is present in antifreeze, \nindustrial solvents and adulterated alcoholic beverages. Methanol is toxic at a relatively low plasma concentration. Methanol is metab-olized by alcohol dehydrogenase  and ALDH  into formaldehyde and \nformic acid, respectively. Formic acid is responsible for the manifesta-tions of methanol poisoning. It leads to metabolic acidosis and death. Treatment of methanol poisoning involves inhibition of alcohol dehydro-\ngenase , so that methanol is not metabolized into formic acid. This can \nbe achieved by fomepizole, a competitive inhibitor of  alcohol dehydro-\ngenase . Ethanol also can be used as a competitive inhibitor, since the \naffinity of ethanol for  alcohol dehydrogenase  is 10\u201320 times higher than \nthat of methanol. Unmetabolized methanol is excreted via lungs.\nIV.

However, many xenobiotics undergo the subsequent phase 2 reac-tion before excretion.

The molecules added to the substrates can be glucuronic acid (glucuronidation), gluta-thione, acetate (acetylation), methyl group (methylation), sulfate (sulfation), and amino acids. The enzymes catalyzing glucuronidation are present in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum; most other enzymes are cytoplasmic.\nSome xenobiotics directly enter phase 2 without undergoing phase 1 reac-\ntions. Like in case of phase 1 reactions, phase 2 reactions also some-times lead to bioactivation. An example for the previous two scenarios is the phase 2 biotransformation of morphine. Morphine, without undergoing phase 1 biotransformation, is conjugated with UDP-glucuronic acid to form morphine-6-glucuronide; morphine-6-glucuronide is much more potent than morphine in relieving pain. Morphine-6-glucuronide is water soluble and is excreted in urine. \nThe differences between phase 1 and phase 2 biotransformation reactions \nare given in \nFigure 46.7 .\nA. Glucuronidation\nUDP-glucuronic acid acts as the donor for glucuronidation reactions, the most common phase 2 reaction. The reactions are catalyzed by microsomal enzymes known as UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) . \nThere are two families of UGTs\u2014UGT1 and UGT2. Apart from the conju-gation of xenobiotics, endogenous molecules like bilirubin and steroid hormones also undergo glucuronidation, making them water soluble before excretion.\nUGT1A1, which is involved in glucuronidation of bilirubin is also involved \nin metabolism of certain drugs. 4%\u201316% of the population has a low UGT1A1 enzyme activity (i.e., 10%\u201333% of the normal enzyme activity), and this condition is termed as Gilbert syndrome. The decreased activity is due to a promoter mutation or a missense mutation of the UGT1A1 \ngene. The condition as such is harmless and presents as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. But when certain drugs (e.g., irinotecan, an anti-cancer drug) that are metabolized with the help of UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation are administered to individuals with Gilbert syndrome, inadvertent drug side effects may be encountered.\nCertain drugs like barbiturates can induce UGTs leading to drug-drug \ninteractions.\nProperty Phase 1 Reactions Phase 2 Reactions\nNature of the reaction Hydroxylation\nEpoxide hydrolysisDehydrogenationGlucuronidation\nGlutathione conjugationAcetylationMethylationSulfationConjugation with amino acids\nMechanism Exposure/generation of polar groups Conjugation with endogenous moleculesEffect of the reaction Mild increase in hydrophilicity\nInactivation of xenobioticSometimes, bioactivationHuge increase in hydrophilicity\nFacilitates excretionSometimes, bioactivation\nIntracellular location Mostly microsomal Mostly cytoplasmic\nFigure 46.7\nDifferences between phase 1 and phase 2 biotransformation reactions.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   798 24-10-2020   12:14:39"

Glutathione conjugation\nGlutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide thiol with the chemical name \u03b3-glutamyl-\ncysteinyl-glycine. Many properties of glutathione are conferred to it by the highly reactive thiol (-SH) group present in one of its constituent amino acids\u2014cysteine; hence the abbreviation GSH. Xenobiotics form a thioether (-S-) linkage with glutathione (\nFig. 46.8 ). This reaction is \ncatalyzed by enzymes known as glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) . \nCytoplasmic GSTs are important in the xenobiotic metabolism, and are present in higher concentrations in liver. Due to their high concentra-tions, they also bind nonspecifically (and without any catalytic effect) to molecules like bilirubin and steroid molecules to retain these molecules in liver cytoplasm for their metabolism by other enzymes like UGTs . \nPreviously, GSTs  were known as ligandins. \nGlutathione-conjugated xenobiotics usually undergo phase 3 biotrans-\nformation (see Section V. Phase 3 biotransformation reactions and excretion of metabolized xenobiotics, p. 800) reactions before excretion.\nC. N-Acetylation\nThe donor for N-acetylation reactions is acetyl CoA. The reactions are catalyzed by N-acetyltransferases (NATs) . Polymorphic variants of \nNATs exist, and this is relevant in the metabolism of certain drugs. An example is isoniazid (INH) which is used in the treatment of tubercu-losis. Depending on the genotype, individuals can be \u201cfast acetylators,\u201d \u201cnormal acetylators,\u201d or \u201cslow acetylators.\u201d Fast acetylators rapidly metabolize the drug, resulting in inadequate antitubercular effects. Slow acetylators are susceptible to INH toxicity, which manifests as peripheral neuropathy (due to pyridoxine deficiency\u2014see Chapter 32, Section V.A. Clinical indications for pyridoxine, p. 529) and liver damage.\nD.

The donor of the sulfate group is 3\u2019-phosphoadenosine-5\u2019-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Fig. 22.6, p. 324), also known as \u201cactive sulfate.\u201d Apart from xenobiotic metabolism, PAPS also play a role in the formation of sulfated glycolipids and proteoglycans (see Chapter 19, Section III.E. Sulfate group addition, p. 269).\n\u2022 Xenobiotics can also be conjugated with amino acids like glycine \nand glutamate. Sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate are commonly used food preservatives. Benzoate is converted to benzoyl CoA which reacts with glycine to form hippuric acid. The latter is excreted in urine.\nV.  PHASE 3 BIOTRANSFORMATION REACTIONS AND \nEXCRETION OF METABOLIZED XENOBIOTICS\nSometimes, a phase 3 biotransformation precedes the excretion of the \nproducts of phase 2 reactions.

They are solute carrier (SLC) transporter proteins and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). The latter belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (see Chapter 23, Section VI.E, p. 359).\nVI.  PHARMACOGENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED \nMEDICINE\nThroughout this chapter, we have seen that polymorphic variants exist for \ngenes that encode various drug metabolizing enzymes like CYPs , gluc-\nuronosyltransferases , NATs , etc. The response generated to various phar-\nmacological agents thus depend on the genotype of the individual. While those individuals with wild-type alleles follow the expected course of drug action, this is not the case with poor metabolizers and ultra-rapid metabo-lizers. They are prone to experience drug toxicity or suboptimal drug effects as the case may be. If we have a prior knowledge of the genotype and gene expression patterns of an individual, the person can receive tailored medi-cations according to the functioning of the drug-metabolizing enzymes. Doses can be adjusted, and drugs causing untoward effects can be avoided. This concept is known as personalized medicine, and the study of the role of genome in response to drugs is known as pharmacogenomics.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   800 24-10-2020   12:14:39"

Medical Perspectives\nThe importance of xenobiotic metabolism in various clinically relevant contexts like predisposition to cancers, drug-\ndrug interactions, methanol poisoning, pharmacogenomics, etc. has been covered in the previous sections. This section describes some additional medical perspectives in relation to xenobiotic metabolism.\n\u2022 Paracetamol or acetaminophen is a widely used over-the-counter medication used in the management of fever and pain. \nThe safe dose in adults is 3 g/day. At higher doses, paracetamol leads to severe hepatotoxicity and hepatocellular damage. Indeed, paracetamol poisoning is the common cause of acute liver failure and liver transplantation in many countries.\n Paracetamol is detoxified either by conjugation or by hepatic CYP enzymes (\nFig. 46.9) . At pharmacological doses, \n90% of paracetamol gets conjugated to form glucuronic acid and sulfate derivatives which are excreted in urine; CYP enzymes play only a minor role in paracetamol metabolism; this produces minimal quantities of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) which is then conjugated with glutathione to form mercapturic acid derivatives which are excreted (\nFig. 46.8 ). At toxic doses, the conjugation pathways for paracetamol metabolism are overwhelmed and the \nCYP enzymes take over, generating large quantities of NAPQI. NAPQI has a high propensity to bind to -SH groups. Binding rapidly to the -SH groups of glutathione, NAPQI depletes the intracellular glutathione stores. Following this, NAPQI irreversibly binds various intracellular proteins with -SH groups, forming NAPQI-protein adducts. A widespread cellular dysfunction, especially mitochondrial dysfunction, ensues and leads to hepatocellular injury.\n The specific antidote in paracetamol poisoning is N-acetylcysteine. A thiol (-SH) containing compound, N-acetylcysteine \nacts by at least two distinct mechanisms\u2014(1) by replenishing the intracellular glutathione stores and (2) by directly binding to NAPQI, impeding the binding of NAPQI to cellular proteins.\n\u2022 We have seen that some xenobiotics are excreted after conjugation with amino acids\u2014an example of benzoate (indeed \nbenzoyl CoA) conjugating with glycine to form hippuric acid was given in Section IV.D, p. 800. The same principle applied in a reverse direction is used in the treatment of certain disorders. In urea cycle defects leading to hyperam-monemia, excretion of nitrogen in the form of urea is not possible. As an alternative mechanism for nitrogen excre-tion, sodium benzoate can be administered in these individuals. Benzoate, after getting converted to benzoyl CoA, combines with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is excreted. Since glycine contains one nitrogen atom, this whole process aids in removal of one nitrogen from the body, per sodium benzoate molecule administered.\n\u2022 Heme is a negative regulator of the enzyme ALA synthase 1 , the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis. Cytochrome \nP450 enzymes are hemoproteins. When these enzymes are induced leading to more enzyme production, the intracel-lular level of heme is reduced (as heme gets incorporated into the newly synthesized enzymes). Thus, the inhibition for heme synthesis is removed during cytochrome P450 induction resulting in increased formation of precursors of heme. In porphyrias, where the functioning of various enzymes of heme synthesis is diminished, these intermediates accu-mulate in increasing amounts, precipitating the disease manifestations. This is the rationale for avoidance for alcohol and CYP enzyme inducers in patients with porphyria.\nCytochrome P450\nParacetamol\nConjugation with \nglucuronic acid/ \nsulfatesComes into play \nin paracetamol poisoning, when conjugation is overwhelmed\nWhen glutathione\nis unavailableGlutathioneN-acetyl\ncysteine\nAdduct formation with \ncellular proteins having\n \u2013SH groupsMercapturic \nacid derivatives>90% of metabolism \nin pharmacological doses<10% of metabolism in \npharmacological doses\nGlucuronide/ \nsulfate derivatives\nExcreted Excreted Cell deathNAPQI\nFigure 46.9\nParacetamol poisoning.

Human body metabolizes xenobiotics to render them nontoxic and prevents their accumulation. This is achieved by a series of enzymatic reactions termed as biotransformation. Hepatocytes play a central role in the process, though a number of these enzymes are present in most of the tissues. Xenobiotic metabolism involves multiple steps. In phase 1 reactions, lipophilic molecules are transformed into relatively hydrophilic molecules by exposing or generating a polar group. Many xenobiotics undergo the subsequent phase 2 reactions, where the products of phase 1 reactions are conjugated with endogenous molecules to make them further hydrophilic, and to facilitate their transport outside the cells via various transporter proteins. Some xenobiotics undergo a phase 3 reaction also before excretion. Sometimes, biotransformation results in the activation of the molecule\u2014this process is termed as bioactivation. Activated precursor molecules include prodrugs and procarcinogens. Apart from their actions on xenobiotics, the enzymes and reactions involved in biotransformation are also involved in metabolism of certain endogenous molecules.\nThe most prominent phase 1 reactions are the hydroxylation reactions, and the most studied enzymes involved in hydrox-\nylation reactions belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily. There are at least 57 functional CYP genes in humans and they are responsible for the metabolism of 50%\u201370% drugs that are currently in use. They are also involved in the metab-olism of endogenous molecules like cholesterol and bile acids. Apart from cytochrome P450 superfamily, phase 1 reac-tions are also mediated by flavin-containing monooxygenases  (FMOs),  epoxide hydrolases , and dehydrogenases . Phase 2 \nreactions involve conjugations. The molecules added to the substrates can be glucuronic acid (glucuronidation), gluta-thione, acetate (acetylation), methyl group (methylation), sulfate (sulfation), and amino acids (\nFig. 46.10 ).\nPolymorphic variants exist for genes that encode various drug metabolizing enzymes like CYPs , glucuronosyltransferases , \nN-acetyltransferases (NATs) , etc. and these polymorphisms are important in drug administration and disease suscepti-\nbility. The study of the role of genome in response to drugs is known as pharmacogenomics. Knowledge of xenobiotic metabolism is also important in management of conditions like methanol poisoning, paracetamol toxicity, etc. and in screening of chemicals for mutagenesis. \nFigure 46.10\nKey concept map of xenobiotic metabolism.Lipophilic XenobioticAccumulation in \nmembranes/adipose tissue\nBioactivation\nActive Drugs Prodrugs\nProcarcinogens Carcinogens\nGlucuronidation\nGlutathione conjugationAcetylationMethylationSulfationConjugation with amino acids\nExcretionHydrophilicPhase 1 \nBiotransformation\nPhase 2 \nBiotransformation\nPhase 3 \nBiotransformationHydroxylation\nEpoxide hydrolysisDehydrogenationCYP450FMOs\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   802 24-10-2020   12:14:40"

A 45-year-old male was brought to the emergency \nwith complaints of nausea, vomiting and abdom-inal pain. Physical examination showed tenderness in the right hypochondrium. Further questioning revealed that he had consumed at least 20 tablets of paracetamol (650 mg), about 24 hours before, because he was emotionally disturbed after an argument with his wife.\n Laboratory investigations showed highly elevated \naspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine trans-aminase (ALT) levels, and an elevated prothrombin time.

How is paracetamol normally metabolized by \nthe body?\nAnswer\u2014B:  At toxic doses, paracetamol is metabolized \nby CYP enzymes, generating large quantities of NAPQI. Binding rapidly to the -SH groups of glutathione, NAPQI depletes the intracellular glutathione stores. Following this, NAPQI irreversibly binds various intracellular proteins with -SH groups, forming NAPQI-protein adducts. Widespread cellular dysfunction, especially mitochondrial dysfunc-tion, that follows causes hepatocellular injury, releasing the intracellular enzymes into circulation, causing marked elevations in AST and ALT levels.

Arterial blood gas analysis and serum electrolyte estima-tions revealed high anion-gap metabolic acidosis. A provisional diagnosis of methanol poisoning was made, and treatment was initiated.\nA. How is methanol metabolized by the body?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Formic acid which is formed as a result of \nmethanol metabolism is a nonvolatile acid; accumula-tion of formic acid reduces blood pH and causes meta-bolic acidosis. Anion gap is due to increase in the levels of unmeasured anions during routine arterial blood gas and serum electrolyte analysis. These include anions other than chloride and bicarbonate.

What is the reason for high-anion gap meta-\nbolic acidosis?\nAnswer\u2014C:  Treatment of methanol poisoning involves \ninhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase, so that methanol is not metabolized into formic acid. This can be achieved by fomepizole, a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydroge-nase.

OVERVIEW\nFree radicals refer to those chemical species with an unpaired electron in its \nouter orbital. They accept or donate the unpaired electron to attain stability and are hence highly reactive. Various oxygen containing free radicals and other unstable highly reactive chemical entities possessing oxygen, consti-tute what is termed as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Similar molecular entities which contain a nitrogen atom are termed as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Collectively known as cellular oxidant species, both ROS and RNS are produced in our body during the course of normal cellular metabolism, and their production is enhanced by certain chemical, biolog-ical and environmental stimuli. Due to the inherent nature of these entities to react with other cellular molecules so as to achieve stability, ROS and RNS invariably bring about alterations in the structures of macromolecules like nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Thus, they can have far-reaching effects on the homeostasis of the cell. Understandably, various defense mechanisms exist to counter the effects of these oxidants, so as to prevent the alterations they induce in the cell (\nFig. 47.1 ). This chapter describes the \ngeneration and the effects of ROS and RNS in a mammalian cell, various antioxidant defense systems that act to balance these effects, and the mechanisms by which the imbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems initiate or drive the progression of physiological and pathological states like aging, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis.\nII.

Among the ROS, hydroxyl radical is the most potent oxidant. As evident from their chemical structure, not all the oxidant species contain an unpaired electron in the outer orbital. However, even those ROS and RNS that are not free radicals can lead to generation of free radicals, and subsequently their deleterious consequences. Multiple mech-anisms that occur in the cell can lead to the formation of oxidant species.\nA. Biological oxidation\nBiological oxidation is a major source of free radical generation. The final phase of oxidation of cellular metabolites occurs in the electron transport chain (ETC) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, NADH and FADH\n2 donate their electrons to the complexes I \nand II, respectively, to regenerate NAD+ and FAD. These electrons are \ntransported along complex III to complex IV, where they are accepted by oxygen, the final electron acceptor, to get converted into water (see Fig. 11.8). The efficiency of this system is not 100%, and elec-tron leak occurs at different complexes of the ETC, more so in case of aged mitochondria.

Cellular inflammation\nActivated leukocytes (e.g., activated macrophages and neuteophils) \ngenerate oxidants during the course of cellular inflammation ( Fig. 47.3 ). \nPresence of pathogens leads to activation of phagocytosis ( phago : eat, \ncyte: cell) by these cells, and one mechanism by which the destruc-\ntion of the pathogens is brought about is by oxidant-dependent killing. The inflammatory cells undergo respiratory burst, a metabolic reaction which leads to generation of abundant quantities of superoxide ions.

Higher level of oxidative toxicity mediated by iron can even lead to a specific form of programmed cell death known as ferroptosis ( ferro: iron, ptosis : falling). Hence, in the human body, tran-\nsition metals like iron and copper are mostly complexed with storage or transport proteins (like ferritin, ceruloplasmin and transferrin) to limit the availability of the free intracellular forms, thus to minimize their toxic effects. \nD. Other sources of cellular oxidant species\nUltraviolet rays, especially those in the UV-A spectrum (315\u2013400 nm) which are not absorbed by the ozone layer, can excite the outer orbital electrons of water and oxygen molecules within the skin cells, leading onto the formation of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A similar effect is also seen with ionizing radiations, including X-rays and gamma rays.\nFree radicals can also be formed from the metabolism of exogenous \ncompounds like drugs and chemicals. This is exemplified by the gener-ation of CCl\n3. from carbon tetrachloride, and similar free radicals from \nother halogenated hydrocarbons. Cigarette tar is a source of chemi-cals that can accelerate generation of free radicals like hydroxyl radical.\nIII.  OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF \nCELLULAR OXIDANTS\nCertain cellular states lead to a situation where the generation of the \ncellular oxidant species is at such extents that the counterregulatory anti-oxidant defense mechanisms are overwhelmed. Thus, the levels of the oxidants remain persistently high in such situations, leading to aberrations from steady state and ultimately, cell toxicity. This condition is known as oxidative stress. Cellular oxidants bring about their detrimental effects by multiple mechanisms.\nA.

DNA adducts \nrefer to the DNA which is covalently bonded to a chemical species; they can be hazardous because certain oxidized bases and nucleo-tide adducts are identified different from their parent bases by the DNA polymerases. This leads to introduction of mutations in the daughter strand during replication. For example, hydroxyl radical can lead to oxidation of guanine to 8-oxoguanine. Unlike guanine which forms a Watson-Crick base pair with cytosine, 8-oxoguanine base pairs with adenine. This leads to introduction of a transversion mutation (cyto-sine to adenine) in the daughter strand (\nFig. 47.4 ). Normally such base \nperturbations are countered by the DNA repair systems, but in pres-ence of free radicals, the DNA repair mechanisms are overwhelmed, and alterations in DNA can lead to arrest of cell cycle and cessation of cell division (this is termed \u201ccellular senescence\u201d).\nB. Protein damage and unfolded protein response\nOxidant-induced damage affects protein function by modification of side chain of amino acids leading to alteration in the structure and function. Oxidation of cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation can affect folding of proteins into their native functional forms. Oxidation of critical residues involved in catalysis and ligand binding affects enzyme and receptor functions, respectively. For instance, oxidant chemicals present in tobacco smoke lead to oxidation of methionine residues of proteins to form methionine sulfoxide. Formation of sulfoxide at crit-ical methionine residues (positions 351 or 358) of \u03b11-antiproteinase, \na protein involved in limiting the activity of proteinases, nullifies its activity, leading to degradation of proteins like elastin. Elasticity of the lung, when compromised leads to diseases like emphysema.\nOxidants also cause accelerated proteolysis and also, generation of \nprotein adducts that can lead to abnormal protein folding. When such unfolded proteins accumulate, the cell resorts to a salvage mecha-nism known as \u201cunfolded protein response\u201d (UPR) (see Chapter 37, Section VI.C. Protein degradation, p. 648). If the extent of damage is beyond the limits of UPR to contain, apoptotic pathways are activated, resulting in cell death.\nC. Lipid peroxidation\nROS and RNS can react with lipid components of the biological membranes (plasma membrane and membranes of organelles) to cause widespread membrane damage. The usual targets are the polyunsatu-rated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in the membrane phospholipids. \nLipid peroxidation happens in three distinct phases (\nFig. 47.5 ).\n 1. Initiation:  Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation is initiated when \nthe allylic hydrogen of the methylene group is removed from the PUFA by an oxidant species, for instance hydroxyl radical, to generate a lipid radical; the hydroxyl group itself is converted to water.\n 2. Propagation:  The lipid radical generated reacts with a molecular \noxygen to form a lipid peroxyl radical, which can react with more PUFAs, generating lipid peroxides, and regenerating lipid radicals. The regeneration of lipid radicals in this step initiates a chain reac-tion, highly amplifying the production of lipid peroxides. Lipid perox-ides can also lead to the formation of alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals, further contributing to the propagation of the chain reaction.Figure 47.4\nOxidation of guanine by hydroxyl \nradical forms 8-oxoguanine which base pairs with adenine, during replication.

Termination:  The chain reaction continues to produce lipid perox-\nides, till the antioxidant defense mechanisms in the cell take over and quench the lipid radicals and eliminate the lipid peroxides (see Section IV for the details). \nD. Physiological functions of cellular oxidants\nIt should be emphasized that though oxidative stress is deleterious, oxidant species mediate critical cellular functions when their levels are within the physiological limits. We have already seen that ROS and RNS have a crucial role in the defense against pathogens, when phagocy-tosed pathogens are neutralized by activated macrophages and neutro-phils; ROS and RNS are also important in mediating inflammation. Nitric oxide has diverse functions as potent vasodilator, signaling mole-cule, inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and inflammatory mediator (see Chapter 18, Section IV.E. Nitric oxide synthesis, p. 256). ROS also has a role in the control of ventilation by carotid bodies where they are involved in oxygen sensing. It has also been seen that various proteins involved in gene expression and signal transduction (like transcription factors, receptors, protein kinases , and phosphatases ) when modified \nby the cellular oxidant species or their downstream products, fine-regu-late their activity, thus mediating important physiological functions. \nIV. ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE MECHANISMS\nBecause the cellular oxidants lead to unwanted effects when their levels are unchecked, various mechanisms exist in the cell to contain their levels. Though some oxidants, like superoxide radical, to certain extent get spontaneously converted to less potent forms, well-defined antioxi-dant mechanisms are present in the cell to actively quench the effect of Figure 47.5\nLipid peroxidation proceeds through initiation and propagation steps. Note that a chain reaction is initiated at the propagation step, leading to an amplified generation of lipid peroxyl radical and lipid peroxides. This continues till these products are quenched by some cellular antioxidant which acts on the lipids.R-CH2-CH=CH-CH.-CH2-R\nR-CH2-CH=CH-CH-CH2-R\nR-CH2-CH=CH-CH-CH2-R\nR-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-RInitiation\nPropagation\nLipid peroxideUnsaturated fatty acid Lipid radical\nLipid peroxyl radical\nTermination\nUnsaturated fatty acidAntioxidantsR-CH2-CH=CH-CH-CH2-R + .OHH\nH2OO2\nO\nO.\nO\nO.\n Membrane lipid peroxidation \nleads to alteration in the trans-membrane potential, disrup-tion of organellar membranes leading to dysfunction of organelles, and induction of apoptosis. Products of lipid peroxidation can also form DNA adducts, leading to generation of mutations. Oxidant-mediated changes can also occur in lipid compo-nents apart from PUFA. Cholesterol can undergo oxidation to keto-, hydroxy-, and hydroperoxy-cholesterol. Free radical-mediated oxida-tion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to form oxidized LDL is a major mechanism for the pathogenesis of atheroscle-rosis (see Section VI.C).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   811 24-10-2020   12:14:42"

The antioxidant defense mechanisms in the body can be cate-\ngorized according to the levels at which they act. The first line of defense is provided by the preventive antioxidants, which abrogate the formation of oxidants (e.g., metal-binding proteins like transferrin), while the second line of defense is maintained by chain-breaking antioxidants, which nullify the effect of oxidants by terminating the chain initiation or chain propa-gation steps. Certain antioxidants act preferentially or exclusively in the aqueous phase, while others are predominantly lipophilic. The latter, for obvious reasons, are important in keeping lipid peroxidation at bay. A third level of defense also exists, comprised by various cellular mechanisms involved in the repair or clearing of the macromolecules that had undergone oxidant-mediated damage. This is exemplified by DNA repair enzymes (see Chapter 35, Section VI. DNA repair, p. 604) and unfolded protein response (see Chapter 37, Section VI.C. Protein degradation, p. 648).\nA. Enzymes with antioxidant effects\nVarious cellular enzymes can limit the generation of potent ROS from milder forms, acting as preventive antioxidants. Catalase is present in membrane-bound organelles called peroxisomes which are the sites of generation of H\n2O2 during oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (see \nSection II.D). The reaction catalyzed is:\n2H2O2 \u2192 2H 2O + O 2\nLocalization of catalase at the site of ROS generation helps in efficiently \nnegating the generation of other free radicals from H 2O2. Peroxides can \nalso be acted upon by various peroxidases in the cell, to form hydrox-\nides, which do not possess oxidant effects. \nROOR\u2019 + AH 2 \u2192 ROH + R\u2019OH + A\nA prominent antioxidant enzyme in most cell types is glutathione \nperoxidase (see Fig. 18.5), which utilizes glutathione (GSH) to reduce \nperoxides. This enzyme requires selenium and catalyzes the following reaction, in accordance with the general equation mentioned above.\nROOR\u2019 + 2GSH \u2192 ROH + R\u2019OH + GSSG\nReduced glutathione (GSH) needs to be regenerated from the oxidized form (GSSG) for further catalysis by glutathione peroxidase . This regen-\neration is catalyzed by glutathione reductase , an NADPH-dependent \nflavoenzyme.\nGSSG + NADPH + H\n+ \u2192 2GSH + NADP+\nGlutathione, with the aid of these enzymes, thus plays a crucial role in \nthe cellular antioxidant defense. It also has to be noted that adequate levels of NADPH are required for the normal maintenance of this system, and conditions in which NADPH levels are depleted predispose to oxidant injury.\nDismutation refers to the generation of two molecules\u2014one with a \nhigher and the other with a lower oxidation state, from a compound of intermediate oxidation state (or vice versa).

One postulated mechanism for the nerve damage seen in this condition is the oxidant-mediated damage due to suboptimal func-tioning of SOD.\nB. Antioxidant role of vitamins\nVitamin E (tocopherol), the most potent lipophilic antioxidant, plays a crucial role in termination of lipid peroxidation, and is the major chain-breaking antioxidant. The reaction of \u03b1-tocopherol with lipid peroxides \nforms relatively inert hydroxy-fatty acids, the former getting converted to \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radical (\nFig. 47.6 ). The \u03b1-tocopherol is regenerated \nfrom \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radical by other antioxidants like ascorbic acid \nand retinol. \nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) exerts a major antioxidant activity by reduc-\ntion of \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radical to regenerate vitamin E ( Fig. 47.6 ). \nMonodehydroascorbate radical formed in this step is a stable radical and can be reduced to dehydroascorbic acid enzymatically or nonen-zymatically. Thus, vitamin C can have a multipronged effect in cellular antioxidant defense. Dehydroascorbic acid generated requires reducing agents like glutathione for its enzymatic reduction (by dehydroascor-\nbate reductase ) to form ascorbic acid again. Ascorbate can also directly \nact on ROS like H\n2O2 and hydroxyl radical, and on RNS.\nC. Other antioxidants\nApart from vitamins C and E, the other dietary antioxidants include \u03b2-carotene\u2014the precursor molecule of vitamin A, lycopene\u2014the carot-\nenoid found in tomatoes, selenium (mostly because of its cofactor activity for glutathione peroxidase ) and polyphenols (like resveratrol \nwhich is present in red wine, and catechin present in green tea).\nTwo major antioxidants in plasma are bilirubin and uric acid. Bilirubin \ncan scavenge oxidant species in solution as well as membranes. In humans, almost half of the antioxidant activity in plasma is contrib-uted by uric acid. Indeed, our serum uric acid levels are at values near the saturation and is much higher than the other primates.

Antioxidants in excess can act as prooxidants\nBecause of the apparent benefits of antioxidants by reducing the damage caused by oxidant species, various clinical trials explored the efficacy of supplementation of antioxidants to prevent disease genera-tion or progression. But the results of these studies were counterintui-tive, leading to the proposition that\u2014in excess, antioxidants can have a prooxidant effect. For instance, supplementation of vitamin E can lead to elevated levels of \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radical, which can oxidize various \nlipid components of the cell, by persisting in the cell for longer dura-tions. Also, excess removal of oxidants from the cell can compromise their function because of the disruption of the physiological functions like cell signaling, which are mediated by oxidants.\nV. ESTIMATION OF CELLULAR OXIDANT SPECIES\nBecause of the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on biological systems, it is essential to assess the levels of cellular oxidant species and/or their downstream products, to study the effects of various interventions that are generated to counter them. \n\u2022 The classical technique to estimate lipid peroxidation relies on the \nformation of products like malondialdehyde (MDA) (O=CH-CH\n2-CH=O) \nas a result of decomposition of lipid peroxides. MDA reacts with thio-barbituric acid (TBA) to form an adduct (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances\u2014TBARS), which can be measured colorimetrically.\n\u2022 Peroxides can be estimated by their ability to oxidize Fe\n2+ to Fe3+. In a \nsulfuric acid solution, the Fe3+ formed, complexes with xylenol orange \n(XO) present in the reagent to form a purple product which can be quan-tified colorimetrically.\n\u2022 The ratio of GSH to GSSG (reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione) is \nalso another crucial indicator of the cellular redox status. \n\u2022 Cellular oxidant levels can also be estimated with the help of various \ndyes that fluoresce in their oxidized form. In this case, a higher fluores-cence level indicates the presence of oxidative stress.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   814 24-10-2020   12:14:43"

            "Text": "VI. Medical Perspectives 815\nVI. Medical Perspectives\nOxidative stress can affect all the cell types in the body and can lead to numerous disease states. Indeed, current studies \nsuggest that almost all diseases have some contribution by oxidant species in their development and/or progression. This section describes some well-established biological and pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress.\nA. Aging \nFree radical theory of aging implicates free radicals as the cause of aging. As the cell or the organism ages, the more \nits constituents get exposed to oxidative stress. This results in perturbations in the homeostasis due to the effect of free radicals on DNA, lipids and proteins. Accumulation of mutations leads to cessation of cell division, which is known as cell senescence. Mutations also lead to cellular dysfunction and induction of apoptosis. All these, when seen at the level of organism, are contributing factors for aging. Wrinkled skin in aged individuals is a direct evidence of free radicals on aging. This occurs due to decreased synthesis of collagen and elastin, due to the free radical-mediated disruption of protein synthesis.\nB. Cancer\nA number of conditions associated with oxidative stress, like long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation and chronic \ninflammation, are predisposing conditions to the development of cancer. In carcinogenesis, a mechanism similar to aging operates; but the cells that have accumulated the mutations because of oxidative stress, escape senescence and apop-tosis, and continue to proliferate. This leads to generation of additional mutations and elusion from the cell cycle regula-tory mechanisms, leading to abnormal, unregulated proliferation\u2014and thus cancer.\nInterestingly, radiation therapy used in treatment of certain malignancies, renders its effect on cancer cells due to toxicity \ngenerated by free radicals. The ionizing radiation used in radiation therapy leads to generation of oxygen-derived free radi-cals (especially hydroxyl radical) in the tumor environment, by ionization of intracellular molecules like oxygen and water. This results in the death of cancer cells, mostly due to extensive membrane and DNA damage.\nC. Atherosclerosis\nOxidation of lipids and proteins present in the LDL leads to the generation of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). Recall that LDL is \nremoved from circulation by peripheral cells including macrophages, by the LDL receptor, which is highly regulated (see Chapter 23.VI.D.2. Endocytosed cholesterol and cholesterol homeostasis, p. 355). On the other hand, ox-LDL is taken up by the macrophages present in the tunica intima of the blood vessels, via an unregulated scavenger receptor (SR-B1), leading to accumulation of increased amounts of cholesterol within these cells. Formation of the so called \"foam cells\" leads to the development of atherosclerotic plaque in the blood vessels (see Fig. 23.22). Ox-LDL is also directly toxic to the endothelial cells, accelerating the generation of plaque. One of the mechanisms by which high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against atherosclerosis is due to the presence of the enzyme paraoxonase-1 , which is an antioxidant that \nprotects against lipid peroxidation of LDL.\nOxidant-mediated injury is also implicated in paradoxical tissue damage to brain and myocardium following stroke or \nmyocardial infarction, respectively, when circulation is re-established to these tissues following a period of ischemia. This condition, which leads to significant organ damage, is termed ischemia-reperfusion injury. \nD. Diabetes mellitus\nDestruction of pancreatic islets in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is an autoimmune condition, is partly due to the leuko-\ncyte-mediated generation of free radicals, which accompanies inflammatory infiltration of these cells. Oxidative damage is also implicated in the pathogenesis of complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Persistent hyperglycemia leads to entry of glucose into non-insulin dependent tissues like nervous tissues, retina and nephrons. In such tissues, glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase  (see Fig. 17.4), which is an NADPH-dependent reaction. This leads to deple-\ntion of NADPH in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As described previously (Section IV.A), NADPH plays a central role in antioxidant defense, since it is required for maintaining adequate levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). The resul-tant oxidative stress due to reduced levels of GSH in neurons, retina, and nephrons is one of the mechanisms that leads to complications of diabetes mellitus like neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy.\nE. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\nThe destruction of erythrocytes due to oxidative stress, leading to hemolysis, has been described in detail in \nChapter 18, Section.V. G6PD deficiency, p. 257.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   815 24-10-2020   12:14:43"

Chapter Summary\nFree radicals have an unpaired electron in their outer orbital and are highly reactive. Along with other unstable highly reac-\ntive chemical entities, they form ROS and RNS, collectively known as cellular oxidant species. The prominent ROS in the cell are superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and hypochlorite anion, while the major RNS are peroxyni-trite, nitrous acid, and nitric oxide. They are formed during the normal course of metabolism\u2014biological oxidation, cellular inflammation, transition metal-mediated reactions, and due to ionizing radiation and xenobiotics. Oxidative stress refers to the condition when the levels of the oxidants remain persistently high. This can cause damage to DNA, protein and lipids. DNA damage leads to mutations, protein damage leads to proteolysis, protein dysfunction and unfolded protein response, and lipid damage leads to formation of chain reactions where lipid peroxides are formed. ROS and RNS also serve important physiological functions like signal transduction and antimicrobial defense. Antioxidants that counter the effects of ROS and RNS can be broadly classified into preventive and chain-breaking antioxidants. Antioxidants include various antioxidant enzymes, vitamins C and E, certain other dietary molecules, bilirubin and uric acid. Vitamin E is the most potent lipophilic antioxidant and is a chain-breaking antioxidant. In excess quantities, antioxidants can show proox-idant effects. Oxidative stress leads to various conditions like aging, cancer formation, atherosclerosis and complications of diabetes mellitus (\nFig. 47.7 ). Various techniques are available for assessing the oxidative stress in the cell and the body.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   816 24-10-2020   12:14:43"

Describe the deleterious effects of free radicals on cells.\nClinical Case Questions \nAnswer\u2014A:  Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron \nmetabolism, where intracellular level of iron is increased, due to defects in the regulation of its absorption. The iron that is accumulated in the initial stages of hemo-chromatosis is complexed with ferritin, but as the level of iron increases further, free iron starts to accumulate. As described in Section II.C, free iron leads to formation of oxidant species, which leads to oxidative stress and tissue damage.47.1. A 50-year-old male visited his family doctor with \ncomplaints of fatigue and joint pains for more than a year. He gave no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. His uncle died of liver cancer about 10 years ago. The physician noted grayish pigmentation of the skin. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly (enlarged size of the liver) with irregular margins. His liver function tests were mildly deranged; plasma iron: 50 \u03bcmol/l (Reference: 7\u201325 \u03bcmol/l) and serum \nferritin: 3200 \u03bcg/l (Reference: 29\u2013248 \u03bcg/l in \nmales) were elevated. A diagnosis of hemochro-matosis was suspected, which was confirmed by genetic testing for mutations in HFE gene. Since \nthe condition is associated with increased body iron levels, iron chelation therapy with deferox-amine was initiated.\nA. Hemochromatosis can clinically present with \nmanifestations of diabetes mellitus, due to destruction of pancreatic tissue. What could be the mechanism for the tissue destruction?\nAnswer\u2014B:  The effect of oxidant species on DNA leading \nto development of mutations (see Sections III.A and VI.B) predisposes individuals with hemochromatosis to malig-nancy. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease, and hence the positive family history .\nB. What could be the possible reason of the \nfamily history of liver cancer in this case?\nAnswer\u2014A:  SDH is located in the inner mitochondrial \nmembrane and is involved in both citric acid cycle and electron transport system (ETS). The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of succinate to fumarate (see Fig. 14.5). It also forms the complex II of ETS where FADH\n2 donates its \nelectrons to get oxidized to FAD.47.2. Paraganglioma refers to a rare group of tumors \noriginating from neuroendocrine cells. In patients with familial paraganglioma, a frequently mutated set of genes encodes for the subunits of succinate \ndehydrogenase  (SDH) enzyme.\nA. What is the function of SDH?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Mutations in subunits of SDH lead to elec-\ntron leakage from this complex, leading to partial oxida-tion of oxygen to generate ROS (see Section II.A). Again, DNA damage due to ROS predisposes to carcinogenesis.B. What is the mechanism by which the above \nmutations lead to tumor formation?\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   817 24-10-2020   12:14:43"

OVERVIEW\nSince diseases are associated with dysfunction at the cellular level, and \nan alteration in the cellular homeostasis results in changes in the chemical environment of the cell which is afflicted, analysis of chemical parameters can aid in the diagnosis of diseases.\nThe term \u201cOrgan Function Tests\u201d refer to a battery of clinical investiga-\ntions, biochemical and otherwise (e.g., radiological investigations) that are employed to identify the abnormal functioning of the organ under question. A normal test result does not always rule out the possibility of organ dysfunc-tion, whereas an abnormal test result almost always result from a deranged physiology. Thus, paradoxically, organ function tests are most useful in a scenario of organ dysfunction. This chapter will cover the common \u201cOrgan Function Tests\u201d performed in a clinical chemistry laboratory, viz. liver func-tion tests, renal function tests, thyroid function tests, and tests for adrenal dysfunction. Before the description on the tests performed to assess each of these organs, a summary of the physiological functions of these organs are given, so as to provide a perspective to the tests involved to identify the organ dysfunction.\nOne of the effects of injury to cells in any tissue is the release of the \ncontents of the cells into the extracellular milieu, some of which invari-ably enter the plasma. Minute quantities of such molecules may be present in plasma as a result of the usual wear and tear of the tissues. However, in cases of tissue injury, their levels will be significantly elevated. Thus, in clinical scenarios where an organ injury is suspected, a clue to the diag-nosis can be made by estimating the analytes that originate from the organ involved. This forms the basis of biochemical investigations in numerous conditions of tissue injury\u2014e.g., elevation of cardiac troponins (cTnt and cTnI) and CK-MB  isoenzyme in myocardial infarction (see Chapter 10, Section.IX.C.2.

As the name \nsuggests, the former have some specific biological function in the plasma and are present in free form or are attached to the endothelial cells exposed to blood. Their substrates are present in the plasma. Examples include lipo-protein lipase, enzymes involved in blood coagulation (the clotting factors) and proteins of complement system. Since they perform vital biolog-ical functions in the blood, a deficiency or low levels of these enzymes in blood results in diseases like familial chylomicronemia in lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and coagulation disorders in clotting factor deficiencies. Nonfunctional plasma enzymes do not have their substrates present in plasma and thus, they do not serve any physiological function in plasma. They are actually tissue-localized enzymes, with biological actions that are specific to the tissue(s) in which they are located. They enter the plasma as the result of tissue turnover or disease, and thus their levels are elevated in case of tissue injury. As mentioned previously, they are diagnostically significant, and elevated levels of these enzymes in plasma are sugges-tive of some pathology. For example, amylase and lipase (plasma levels are elevated in pancreatitis), LDH, and CK-MB.\nHowever, there is a catch\u2014more than one tissue can release the same \nnonfunctional plasma enzyme or similar analytes into the plasma following tissue injury. For instance, damage to either salivary glands or pancreas can lead to elevation in plasma levels of amylase, as the enzyme is present in both these tissues. Thus, it is important to consider the clinical features, and/or employ a panel of analytes to diagnose the pathology under consideration.\nII. FUNCTIONS OF LIVER\nThe liver is the largest solid organ in the human body, and it acts as the hub of metabolism. It plays a crucial role in the metabolism of carbohy-drates, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides and various micronutrients. Since liver directly receives venous outflow from the intestines via the hepatic portal system, many drugs and toxins (xenobiotics) that enter the body via oral route are metabolized here (first-pass metabolism or first-pass effect). Liver is also involved in metabolism of systemically administered drugs, and endogenous molecules with a potential harmful effect. The liver is also involved in the synthesis of a large number of physiologically important molecules. It has been observed that the liver can regenerate to its original size even after removal of two-thirds of the original tissue mass, and this forms the basis of living-donor liver transplantation. \nHepatocytes, the parenchymal cells of liver accounts for nearly 60% of \ntotal cells in the liver. The functions of liver can be broadly categorized into metabolic functions, synthetic and storage functions, and detoxifica-tion and excretory functions. \nA. Metabolic functions\nMetabolic functions of liver are individually detailed in various chapters throughout this book. To summarize, these include: \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   820 24-10-2020   12:14:44"

Carbohydrate metabolism:  Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, \ngluconeogenesis (the other major site being renal medulla), galac-tose metabolism and fructose metabolism.\n 2. Lipid metabolism:  Synthesis of lipoproteins, phospholipids and \ncholesterol, conversion of cholesterol into bile acids (which forms bile salts that are important in absorption of dietary lipids), removal of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and chylomicron remnants from circulation, ketone body synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation.\n 3. Protein metabolism:  Transamination, oxidative deamination, urea \nformation, and gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis from R groups of catabolized amino acids.\n 4. Nucleotide metabolism:  The liver is the primary site for purine \nsynthesis and uric acid formation.\n 5. Vitamin and micronutrient metabolism:  Regulation of iron \nabsorption via hepcidin synthesis, incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin for transport, synthesis of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (Fig. 32.23), and isomerization of retinol (part of Wald\u2019s visual cycle \u2013 See Chapter 32, Section XI.E.1. Visual cycle, p. 535). The liver is also the site of vitamin K cycle (Fig. 32.26).\nB. Synthetic and storage functions\nApart from the molecules synthesized as a part of the intermediary metabolism mentioned in the previous section, liver is also involved in the synthesis of a variety of substances. The liver also acts as the site of storage of many of these.\n 1.  All the major serum proteins except the immunoglobulins are \nsynthesized in the liver. These include albumin (which is important in maintaining the plasma volume, and also in transport of mole-cules), other transport molecules like transferrin, transthyretin, ceru-loplasmin and hormone-binding globulins, lipoproteins, proteins of the complement system, and acute phase reactants (see X. Medical Perspectives) like C-reactive protein.\n 2.  Hepatocytes are the major sites of synthesis of all the clotting \nfactors except calcium and factor VIII. The latter, along with von Willebrand factor are produced by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. The liver is also the site of the microsomal enzyme vitamin K \nepoxide reductase  and the vitamin K cycle, which is involved in the \n\u03b3-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of factors II, VII, IX and X, \nwhich is necessary for the functioning of these coagulation factors. \n 3.  The liver is the storage site for fat soluble vitamins, viz. vitamins \nA, D, E and K. Of these, vitamin A is stored after esterification into retinyl palmitate in specialized cells known as hepatic stellate cells or Ito cells. The liver also stores vitamin B\n12, the only water-soluble \nvitamin that is stored in the body. The liver stores carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and also stores minerals like iron and copper.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   821 24-10-2020   12:14:44"

At least 50% of drugs adminis-tered to humans and numerous other chemicals are acted upon by the microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase  system (see Chapter 46, \nSection III.A. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily, p. 793), which in most of the cases is involved in inactivation of the compound, in what is known as the phase 1 reactions of xenobiotic metabolism. Phase 2 involves conjugation of the products of phase 1 reactions with mole-cules (e.g., glucuronic acid) to render them hydrophilic and promote their excretion. The liver plays a central role in both phase 1 and phase 2 reactions of xenobiotic metabolism.\nThe liver is also involved in detoxification of endogenous molecules \nlike ammonia to urea via urea cycle. Hepatocytes are also involved in the conjugation of bilirubin with UDP-glucuronic acid to form bili-rubin mono- and diglucuronides (conjugated bilirubin), which are then excreted in the bile. \nThe compounds that are detoxified by liver are excreted through bile or \nin urine via the kidneys. The liver is also involved in removal of choles-terol from the body, either by conversion of cholesterol into bile acids or by facilitating cholesterol excretion as such into the bile. Bile also acts as the portal for removal of other endogenous molecules including certain hormones. \nD. Miscellaneous functions\n 1.  Kupfer cells are tissue macrophages localized to liver; they are \ninvolved in phagocytosis of pathogenic microorganisms and removal of senescent red blood cells (RBCs).\n 2.  The liver also acts as a site of hematopoiesis during intrauterine life. \n 3.  The liver also forms a component of the renin-angiotensin-aldoste-\nrone system (RAAS) as angiotensinogen is synthesized by the hepa-tocytes (see Fig. 5.8).\nIII. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS\nDiseases of liver account for more than 2 million deaths worldwide\u2014with the majority occuring as a complication of cirrhosis (fibrosis of liver accom-panied by nodular regeneration), and the rest are mostly due to viral hepa-titis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver diseases account for 3.5% of the global deaths and liver is the second most commonly transplanted solid organ (most common being the kidney). Further, the number of individ-uals with liver dysfunction are on the rise due to the increasing prevalence of alcohol use (leading to fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis) and metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus and obesity which can cause conditions like fatty liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD) and hepatitis (steatohepatitis), eventually progressing to cirrhosis. Thus, it is pertinent to diagnose and monitor liver diseases in a prompt manner, and biochemical investigations are crucial in achieving this. Further, a number of drugs can lead to hepatotoxicity, for example, antituberculosis drugs and drugs used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   822 24-10-2020   12:14:44"

Thus, biochemical assessment of liver function (or dysfunction) involves a number of analytes. In the subsequent discussion, these analytes are classified according the dysfunctions of liver that they are suggestive of.\nA. Biochemical markers of liver injury\nHepatocellular damage is classically defined by the elevated levels of two enzymes in the plasma, viz. alanine aminotransferase  (ALT)  and \naspartate aminotransferase  (AST) . The older names of these enzymes \nserum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamate \noxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) are rarely used in clinical practice \nnowadays. The reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are shown in Fig. 24.8; note that both these enzymes use pyridoxal phosphate (PLP , the active form of vitamin B\n6) as the coenzyme.\nALT is cytoplasmic and is mostly expressed by the liver, with some \namounts present in the kidneys, skeletal muscles, and other tissues; AST exists as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoenzymes, with very \nhigh contents in liver, myocardium, skeletal muscles and kidneys, and lower amounts in pancreas and RBCs. Thus, ALT is the more \u201cliver-\nspecific\u201d among these transaminases. In most of the liver diseases, the level of ALT is higher than that of AST mostly because of a short half-\nlife of AST (18 hours) compared to that of ALT (36 hours). Exceptions \nare alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, ischemic liver injury, and hepatocel-lular carcinoma, where AST/ALT ratio (known as De Ritis ratio) is usually >1. This may be because of mitochondrial damage in these conditions leading to the leakage of the mitochondrial AST into circulation.\nThe common causes of hepatocellular damage are listed in (\nFig. 48.1 ). \nThe etiology of hepatocellular damage can be identified based on the extent of elevation of the transaminases from the upper reference limit (URL). The highest elevations are seen in ischemic liver injury, followed by hepatitis due to toxicity (e.g., paracetamol overdose or \u03b1-amanitin, \nALT and AST >15 times URL (severe elevation) or >10,000 IU/l (massive elevation)\nAcute viral hepatitis A, B and CAcetaminophen (paracetamol) toxicityIschemic liver injury\nALT and AST 5\u201315 times URL (moderate elevation) \nAlcoholic hepatitisAutoimmune hepatitis\nALT and AST 2\u20135 times URL (mild elevation) \nCarcinoma of liver (hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis)CirrhosisNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Hemochromatosis (see Chapter 33, Section.III.B.5, p. 558 and Chapter 47, Clinical Case Question 47.1, p. 817)Wilson\u2019s disease (see Chapter 33, Section.III.A.2, p. 556)\u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (see Chapter 9, Section III.B.2, p. 130)\nALT and AST up to 2 times URL (borderline elevation) \nChronic viral hepatitis B and C\nFigure 48.1\nCommon causes of hepatocellular damage.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   823 24-10-2020   12:14:44"

This can occur in two broad scenarios, viz. intrahepatic obstruction and extrahepatic obstruction. Intrahepatic biliary obstruc-tion occurs commonly in the background of an associated hepatocel-lular injury, where the inflammation associated with the hepatitis leads to obstruction of the biliary canaliculi. Thus, it is seen in alcoholic, viral and toxic hepatitis. It can also occur in certain autoimmune afflic-tions where small bile ducts are injured, e.g., primary biliary cholan-gitis (previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis). Extrahepatic biliary obstruction occurs due to obstruction of the larger bile ducts, outside the liver, in causing what is termed as obstructive jaundice or post-hepatic jaundice. Causes include stones, tumors or parasitic infections in the bile duct, carcinoma head of pancreas and malignancy around ampulla of Vater (periampullary carcinoma). The biochemical markers of cholestasis include serum bilirubin and three nonfunctional plasma enzymes, viz. alkaline phosphatase  (ALP), \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase \n(GGT) and 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-NT).\n 1. Bilirubin:  \u201cTotal bilirubin\u201d is composed of two fractions, viz. \u201cdirect \nbilirubin\u201d and \u201cindirect bilirubin.\u201d \u201cDirect bilirubin\u201d and \u201cindirect bili-rubin\u201d are considered to be representative of the conjugated bili-rubin and unconjugated bilirubin, respectively, that is present in circulation. Since unconjugated bilirubin is converted to conju-gated bilirubin within the hepatocytes, this process is impaired in hepatocellular damage. Moreover, the intrahepatic biliary obstruc-tion associated hepatocellular injury prevents excretion of conju-gated bilirubin; this conjugated bilirubin regurgitates back into the circulation. Thus, in intrahepatic cholestasis, both direct and indirect bilirubin are elevated in the serum. On the contrary, extrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by a predominant elevation of direct bilirubin only.\n 2. ALP:  Alkaline phosphatase  is involved in hydrolysis of organic phos-\nphate esters, but its exact physiological function is not known. It has multiple isoenzymes and isoforms with a widespread tissue distribution, with highest concentrations in bone, intestine, liver, and placenta. In the liver, the enzyme is present on the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes and also in the cells lining the bile cana-liculi and the larger bile ducts (\nFig. 48.3 ), anchored on the outer \nleaflet of the plasma membrane. Thus, ALP is an \u201cectoenzyme.\u201d ALP is physiologically elevated in children (because of high osteo-blastic activity) and in pregnancy (due to the placental isoenzyme). In cholestasis, elevation of ALP can be due to two mechanisms, both attributed to bile salts, the excretion of which is impaired\u2014(1) bile salts induce the production of ALP by acting at the deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) level, (2) bile salts, owing to their detergent action, release ALP from the canalicular membrane; the released ALP enters the circulation via a paracellular mechanism (\nFig. 48.3 ). \nThe reference interval of ALP in adults is 33\u201396 U/l. Levels >4 times the URL is seen in extrahepatic obstruction and primary biliary chol-angitis, with values sometimes reaching 10\u201312 times the URL. In the other common causes of intrahepatic obstruction and parenchymal liver diseases, the levels are usually 2\u20134 times the URL.\n 3. GGT:  \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase is involved in the synthesis of \nglutathione, and also in the absorption of neutral amino acids in \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   825 24-10-2020   12:14:45"

The enzyme has a predomi-\nnant membrane-bound fraction and a minor microsomal fraction. The membrane-bound fraction is elevated in biliary obstruction. Interestingly, GGT  is also elevated in alcohol abuse and alcoholic \nliver disease. This is probably due an enzyme induction of the microsomal GGT by alcohol, or due to increased leakage of GGT  \nfrom hepatocytes into the circulation by alcohol-mediated hepato-cyte injury, or both. \n 4. 5\u2019-NT:  5\u2019-nucleotidase  plays a role in the catabolism of purines \n(Fig. 34.15). Like ALP , it is an ectoenzyme present on the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes and also in the cells lining the bile cana-liculi. In intra- and extrahepatic cholestases, the levels are increased in the circulation because of the release of the enzyme from the membrane by the bile salts.

Biochemical markers of synthetic functions of liver\nAlthough a large number of molecules are synthesized by the liver, only \ntwo of these are routinely assessed to evaluate the synthetic functions of liver, viz. albumin and prothrombin (and other clotting factors), and the assays used are estimation of serum albumin, and prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), respectively. \n 1. Albumin:  Albumin is exclusively synthesized by the liver. A \ndecrease in serum albumin levels (termed as hypoalbuminemia) occurs commonly due to loss of albumin in urine (e.g., in nephrotic syndrome), and decreased production of albumin by the liver (seen in hepatic dysfunction and in severe malnutrition). Albumin has a half-life of ~14 days, hence a reduction in serum albumin levels is not manifested in acute liver diseases. Thus, the diagnostic utility of albumin is mostly in chronic liver diseases. Indeed, low albumin levels (<2.8 g/dl) is associated with a reduction in survival in patients with cirrhosis.\n 2. PT and INR:  The liver plays two important roles in the context \nof coagulation factors, viz. synthesis of coagulation factors, and vitamin K-dependent \u03b3-carboxylation of glutamyl residues of factors \nII (prothrombin), VII, IX and X which is required for their physiolog-ical function. Thus, the synthesis and/or functioning of prothrombin is impaired in liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction, as the latter leads to impaired absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (including vitamin K) from the intestines (Fig. 20.7). The levels and/or functioning of clotting factors (I, II, V, VII and X) are assessed by PT. PT evaluates the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation; it is estimated by calculating the time required for plasma (which is anticoagulated by Ca\n2+ depletion using citrate) to clot, after addi-\ntion of Ca2+ and tissue factor or tissue thromboplastin (factor III) \n(Fig. 48.5 ). Reference interval is 11\u201313 seconds. In order to stan-\ndardize the estimation of PT across laboratories, another entity, INR was introduced.\nINR = PT of Test\nPT of Control ISI\nwhere,\nPT of Test is the PT for the patient whose sample is being tested,PT of Control is the mean PT of \u226530 healthy individuals, and\n   ISI stands for International Sensitivity Index, which is a value \nassigned based on the thromboplastin reagent in comparison to an international reference reagent. \n   Note: Calculation of INR is primarily used for monitoring patients \nwho are receiving warfarin as a part of anticoagulation therapy (see \nFig. 32.26). \n   Unlike albumin, half-life of prothrombin is short (60 hours). Thus, PT \nis deranged in both acute as well as chronic liver diseases.\nD. Markers of viral hepatitis A to E\nConfirmatory tests for viral hepatitis due to hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses are based either on the detection of viral proteins/nucleic acids in circulation or on the detection of immune response, i.e., generation of FVII\nFX\nVa\nII [Prothrombin]FibrinClot\nFibrinogenIIaFXaTF (FIII)[FVIIa\u2013TF/FIII]\nCa2+\nFigure 48.5\nEstimation of prothrombin time (PT). \nTime for fibrin clot after addition of factor III and Ca\n2+ is determined.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   827 24-10-2020   12:14:46"

The \nnucleic acids are detected after amplification using polymerase chain reaction. Immune response to any infection involves two phases\u2014a primary immune response characterized by the generation of IgM, which is of a short duration, and a secondary immune response which is sustained and is characterized by the formation of IgG. Half-life of IgG (2\u20133 weeks) is much more prolonged than that of IgM (5\u20136 days). IgM is a marker of acute infection, and IgG is suggestive of chronic infection (or recovery from the illness). The specific IgM and IgG against viral proteins are detected using immunological techniques like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A detailed discussion of the viral markers is beyond the scope of this book; some of the features of viral hepatitis due to hepatitis viruses A to E and the tests performed to confirm these are summarized in \nFigure 48.6 . \nE. Other Biochemical tests in liver diseases\nIn liver failure, the ability of liver to convert ammonia to urea is impaired, leading to a reduction in urea levels in circulation and elevation in plasma ammonia. ( Note: A similar finding is seen in urea cycle disorders as well. \nsee Chapter 24, Section VI.C. Hyperammonemia, p. 389 ) Similarly, liver \nfailure is also associated with a decrease in the serum uric acid levels.\nSerum proteins are constituted by albumin and globulins. Since \nalbumin is produced exclusively by the liver, and immunoglobulins, one of the major globulins, are produced by plasma cells (which orig-inate from B lymphocytes), albumin: globulin (known as A:G ratio) is altered in chronic liver diseases. Reference interval for serum albumin is 3.5\u20135.5 g/dl and for total serum globulin is 2.0\u20133.5 g/dl, and for A:G ratio is 1.5\u20132.5:1. The A:G ratio lowering or even reversal is seen espe-cially in chronic viral hepatitis where albumin synthesis is low, and there is an increased production of IgG against the viral proteins.\nHemochromatosis (see Chapter 33, Section.III.B.5, p. 558 and \nChapter 47, Clinical Case Question 47.1, p. 817) is associated with iron overload and an increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation.

In conditions like Wilson\u2019s disease and hereditary hemochro-matosis, genetic testing for detection of mutations in ATP7B  gene in the \nformer, and HFE and other associated genes in the latter, is the main-\nstay in diagnosis. \nIf biochemical tests are insufficient to pinpoint a diagnosis, liver biopsy, \nand histopathological examination of the tissue obtained may be warranted. (A summary on the approach to diagnose a liver disease using the tests discussed above is given in \nFigure 48.17 .)\nIV. FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS\nThe kidneys are paired organs located in the retroperitoneum, the blood-flow to which is nearly 25% of the cardiac output. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, with each kidney having 0.6\u20131.5 million nephrons. The glomeruli filter ~125 ml of blood per minute while most of the glomer-ular filtrate is reabsorbed by the tubules, ultimately to generate 1 ml of urine per minute. Production of urine, albeit an important one, is just one among the multitude of functions that are carried out by the kidneys. Functions of the kidneys can be broadly classified into the following.\nA. Excretory functions\nThe fluid that enters the proximal tubule following glomerular filtration is an ultrafiltrate of the plasma. The glomerular filtration barrier ensures the selection of molecules that are filtered based on their size and charge. The molecular weight cutoff for glomerular filtration is around 70 kDa as the molecules above this size are not filtered. Thus, the glomerular filtrate is composed of water, small molecules (like glucose, amino acids, urea, creatinine and uric acid), electrolytes (like Na\n+, K+, \nCl\u2212, bicarbonate and inorganic phosphate), and low molecular weight \nproteins. Large proteins and cellular components of the blood are not filtered, and presence of these in urine suggests a loss of integrity of the filtration barrier, or addition of these to the urine at the postrenal level (e.g., due to injury to urethra by a calculus, or bleeding from a tumor in the urinary bladder, or a lower urinary tract infection).\nThe filtration barrier has a negative charge due to the presence of \nheparan sulfate proteoglycans, hence, negatively charged molecules have a further low molecular weight cutoff. This is the reason why albumin with a molecular weight of 66.5 kDa is not filtered by the glom-eruli. However, in nephrotic syndrome, this charge barrier is lost, and albumin is lost from the circulation into the urine, leading to a decrease in serum albumin levels.\nApart from glomerular filtration, some of the molecules can also enter \nthe tubular fluid via secretion at the level of proximal and distal tubules; some molecules leave the tubular fluid by tubular reabsorption. The kidneys help in excretion of a large number of molecules including meta-bolic end products like urea, uric acid and creatinine, surplus unwanted molecules like electrolytes, many of the drugs and other xenobiotics, enzymes (e.g., amylase ), and short peptides.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   829 24-10-2020   12:14:46"

Homeostatic functions\nThe kidneys, apart from the facilitation of the removal of many mole-\ncules, regulate the levels of many molecules in the body. This is achieved by a fine control of glomerular filtration as well as the secre-tion and reabsorption at the level of tubules. The kidneys play a key role in the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance and this involves many hormones that act on the nephrons, like antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natri-uretic peptide (BNP) (see Chapter 5, Sections II.B, p. 52, II.D, p. 53, and III.C, p. 56). Thus, electrolyte imbalance is a feature of a large number of kidney diseases. By maintaining water and electrolyte balance, the kidneys ultimately regulate blood volume, and hence blood pressure.\nThe kidneys also regulate the blood pH by controlling bicarbonate \ngeneration, bicarbonate reabsorption, free H\n+ excretion, and combina-\ntion of H+ in the tubular fluid with phosphate and ammonia to cause \nfurther H+ excretion (see Chapter 4, Section II.C, p. 36). They are thus \nthe main line of defense against acidosis and alkalosis. \nApart from the liver, renal medulla is also a site for gluconeogenesis.\nC. Endocrine functions\nThree hormones, their functions widely different from each other are \nproduced by the kidneys.\n 1.  The juxtaglomerular cells on the walls of the afferent arteriole is a \npart of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (see Fig. 5.8). Macula densa acts as a sensor of the Na\n+ levels in the tubular fluid. When the Na+ \nlevels are low, signaling from the macula densa leads to the produc-tion of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells. This ultimately leads to the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone.\n 2.  The interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the kidneys \nproduce erythropoietin ( erythro : red, poiesis: production) in response \nto hypoxia. Erythropoietin acts on the stem cells in the bone marrow to increase the RBC production. Erythropoietin was found to be used by certain athletes for performance enhancement; the use for this purpose is banned by various regulatory authorities. Impaired erythropoietin production in chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to anemia.\n 3.  The final step in the activation of vitamin D, the formation of \n1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) from 25-hydroxychole-calciferol is mediated by the microsomal enzyme 1-\u03b1-hydroxylase \n(Fig. 32.23). The enzyme is induced by high level of parathyroid hormones and low levels of phosphates. The kidneys also play a role in the inactivation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 24,25-dihy-droxycholecalciferol by 24-hydroxylase , when 1-\u03b1-hydroxylase is \ninhibited. CKD is associated with impaired calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and bone and parathyroid abnormalities.\nV.

In such scenarios, biochemical investigations to assess \nrenal function (or rather, dysfunction) is important in diagnosis, severity assessment, and monitoring of the conditions. Renal tests also provide clues for initiation of renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation. Assessment of renal function is also important before the administration of nephrotoxic drugs that can exacerbate preexisting kidney disease. In an era where lifestyle diseases are rampant, renal tests are also important in detecting renal complications of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Small vessel injury in these conditions (microangiop-athy) can affect the glomeruli, leading to nephropathy, which can prog-ress to CKD. Preemptive testing is required to forestall such life-threatening complications.\nThe assessment of renal function involves biochemical tests to assess the \nglomerular function and integrity, and tests to identify the underlying cause of the renal disease (e.g., urine analysis, urinary protein estimation, etc.). \nA. Assessment of glomerular function\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered by all the glomeruli of both the kidneys into their Bowman\u2019s capsules in unit time. GFR which depends on the age, sex and size of the body of the indi-vidual, is ~130 ml/min in males and ~120 ml/min in females. Thus, roughly 180 l of blood is filtered by the kidneys every day, to produce ~1.5 l of urine. GFR is an indicator of the number and functioning of the nephrons. A reduction in GFR is seen in glomerular diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertensive nephrop-athy), in conditions associated with a reduction in the renal perfu-sion (e.g., hypovolemia, heart failure, renal artery stenosis), and due to an increased back pressure on the glomeruli (this is seen in urinary tract obstruction). GFR can be reduced in acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as CKD (by definition, CKD is a renal abnormality that persists for >3 months).\nGFR cannot be measured directly. It is estimated with the help of a \nconcept which is termed as clearance, which is the amount of blood from which a substance is eliminated by both the kidneys in unit time. For a substance that is freely filtered by the glomeruli, which does not have tubular reabsorption or tubular secretion or metabolism in the kidney, the amount filtered will be equal to the amount excreted in the urine. Thus, \nGFR (ml/min) x Concentration of the substance in plasma, P (mg/dl) = \nConcentration of the substance in urine, U (mg/dl) x Urine flow rate, V (ml/min).\nHence, GFR (ml/min) or clearance = (U x V)/P\nThe ideal substance for estimation of clearance is inulin, a polymer of fructose, as it freely filtered by the glomeruli, and does not have tubular reabsorption or tubular secretion or metabolism in the kidney. However, inulin has to be administered exogenously, which is time-consuming, and the assays for inulin are not very perfect. Hence, endogenous mole-cules (those that are synthesized in the body) which can be assayed easily are used as surrogates for inulin clearance/for calculation of GFR.

Diet can also affect serum creatinine levels, if the sample has been collected after consumption of meat.\n Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomeruli, and does not undergo \ntubular reabsorption, however, a certain amount (10%\u201340%) of creatinine enters the tubular fluid because of tubular secretion. Due to this, creatinine clearance overestimates the GFR. Also, in chronic renal diseases, the kidneys compensate for nephron loss by hyper-filtration in the existing nephrons. Because of both these reasons, the changes in serum creatinine and creatinine clearance set in only after the disease has been progressed significantly. This has to be kept in mind while interpreting serum creatinine levels in patients with risk factors for CKDs.\n 2. Cystatin C:  Cystatin C is a low molecular weight protein (12.8 kDa), \na cysteine protease  inhibitor, that is synthesized by all the nucle-\nated cells in the body. It is released into the circulation at a rela-tively constant rate, that unlike creatinine is independent of muscle mass and diet. It is freely filtered by the glomeruli and there is no tubular secretion or reabsorption; cystatin C is indeed broken down within the renal tubules and the levels in urine are very low in normal individuals. The concentration of cystatin C in serum reflects the glomerular function and is inversely related to the GFR; eGFR calculations based on serum cystatin C levels are also available. A caveat regarding cystatin C is that its production is altered in thyroid diseases, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.\n 3. Urea:  Urea, the end product of catabolism of amino group of amino \nacids, is produced in the liver from ammonia via the urea cycle. More than 90% of the urea produced is excreted by the kidney. Urea is freely filtered by the glomeruli, and there is no tubular secretion or active tubular reabsorption; however, there is a significant passive diffusion of urea from the tubules to the renal interstitium which is determined by the urine flow rate. ( Note: Urea also plays a physio-\nlogical function in reabsorption of water by maintaining the medul-lary concentration gradient) . The passive transport of urea into the \ninterstitium is mediated by urea transporters, which are activated by the action of ADH.\nThe reference interval of serum urea is 15\u201340 mg/dl; this varies with \nage and is slightly lower in females. An elevation in the serum urea is termed as azotemia; when azotemia is associated with clinical manifestations and fluid, electrolyte and/or metabolic abnormali-ties, the clinical syndrome is called uremia. Even though serum urea level varies inversely with GFR, estimation of serum urea is not a very useful surrogate for GFR estimation. This is because of the following reasons:\n a.  Urea levels are affected by protein (and amino acid) catabolism. \nUrea levels are higher after a diet rich in proteins, and also in severe malnutrition and other chronic diseases associated with a protein breakdown (e.g., loss of muscle mass). Estimated GFR (eGFR)\nThree parameters are required \nfor calculating the creati-nine clearance applying the formula for clearance given above (U x V/P), including V, the urine volume (which necessitates the collection of urine voided during a 24-hour period), and U, the concen-tration of creatinine in that 24-hour urine sample. Since collection, transport, etc. of the urine sample is time-consuming and cumbersome, other formulas exist, for calcu-lation of GFR based on the estimation of serum creatinine only. The GFR thus calculated is termed eGFR or estimated GFR. Several formulas exist for the calculation of eGFR. One of them, the Modification of Diet in Renal Diseases (MDRD) formula is given below as an example:\neGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m\n2) = \n186.3 \u00d7 serum creatinine\u22121.154 \n\u00d7 age\u22120.203 \u00d7 (0.742, if female) \n\u00d7 (1.21, if black). Note that the formula considers age, sex, and race, as well as the body size (i.e., per 1.73 m\n2) for \ncalculation of the GFR.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   832 24-10-2020   12:14:46"

Since the passive reabsorption is high in situations where the urine flow rate is low, in diseases where urine outflow is obstructed (postrenal azotemia, see Section V.B and \nFig. 48.7 ), urea levels are disproportionately high in the \ncirculation.\nHowever, urea has an important role in identifying the etiology of the \nrenal dysfunction (see Section V.B).\nB. Tests to identify the etiology of renal diseases\nRenal diseases are broadly classified into AKI and CKD. AKI is char-acterized by a sudden deterioration of renal function (in hours to days, usually <48 hours) and elevation of serum urea and creatinine (azotemia), the cause of which can be at the prerenal, intrarenal or postrenal levels. Prerenal azotemia stems usually from a reduction in the glomerular perfusion; intrarenal azotemia occurs due to an intrinsic damage to the kidneys; and postrenal azotemia is due to an obstruction to the flow of urine. The causes are listed in \nFigure 48.7 . The CKD is an insidious \nprocess (the damage persisting for >3 months) with varying degrees of reduction in the GFR and varying severity of albuminuria (excretion of albumin in the urine). As expected, CKD is associated with widespread systemic abnormalities, and when progressed mandates renal replace-ment therapies. Common causes of CKD include diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Other causes are listed in \nFigure 48.7 .\nSome of the biochemical investigations to identify the etiology of AKI \nand/or CKD are detailed below:\n 1. Proteinuria:  In healthy individuals, the daily excretion of proteins in \nthe urine is <150 mg, and most of this is contributed by uromodulin or Tamm-Horsfall protein which is derived from the loop of Henle, and other small proteins that are filtered by the glomeruli. Proteinuria is the excretion of >150 mg of protein in the urine in 24 hours. This is classified into:\n a. Glomerular proteinuria:  Seen in glomerular diseases due to \na loss of the integrity of the filtration barrier (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis). The major protein lost via urine is albumin. Other evidences of glomerular involvement include presence of RBCs in the urine (in inflam-matory conditions, i.e., glomerulonephritis), decreased serum albumin levels (in nephrotic syndrome), etc.\n b. Tubular proteinuria:  Small proteins that are filtered by the \nglomeruli are generally reabsorbed by the tubules. However, this is impaired in tubular dysfunction, and then these small proteins start appearing in the urine, e.g., \u03b22-microglobulin. Increased \nlevels of \u03b22-microglobulin in urine is seen in renal diseases that \naffect the tubules, e.g., due to nephrotoxic drugs.\n c. Overflow proteinuria:  This occurs due to an increase in the \nproduction or release of a protein, which then gets filtered in increased amounts by the glomeruli, resulting in their increased presence in urine. This is seen in multiple myeloma, a malig-nant proliferation of plasma cells, which results in increased production of immunoglobins. The low molecular weight immu-noglobin light chains (molecular weight: 25 kDa) appear in the In many countries including \nthe United States, serum urea is denoted by a related term called Blood Urea Nitrogen or BUN, since historic assays for urea were based on the measurement of nitrogen in blood. Molar mass of nitrogen is 14 g/mol and molar mass of urea is 60 g/mol. 1 mole-cule of urea (NH\n2-CO-NH 2) \ncontains 2 atoms of nitrogen. Thus, ratio of mass of nitrogen to mass of urea is 28/60 which is 0.47. Hence,\n1 mg/dl of serum urea  \u2261 0.47 \nmg/dl of BUN, and conversely, 1 mg/dl of BUN \u2261 2.14 mg/dl \nof serum urea.\nReference interval for BUN is \n7\u201320 mg/dl (This corresponds to serum urea of ~ 15\u201343 mg/dl).\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   833 24-10-2020   12:14:46"

AER of >300 mg/day is seen in individuals with nephropathy due to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but by this time the renal diseases can go irreversible despite the control of the glycemic levels and the blood pressure. Thus, to prevent renal complications, albumin excretion in the urine from 30\u2013300 mg/day has to be detected. However, routine urine tests employ a device known as dipstick which cannot detect such low levels of albumin. [ Note: A dipstick is a reagent strip with \nreagents for one or more analytes; it can be dipped in the collected urine sample. Proteins, or other analytes as the case may be, react with the reagents in the dipstick to give a change in color which can be compared with a standard color chart to obtain an approximate quantification of the analyte  (\nFig. 48.8 ).]\n Albumin excretion rate of 30\u2013300 mg/day, detected using immu-\nnological techniques, is termed as microalbuminuria.

Since a 24-hour urine collection for AER is tedious, albumin excretion can also be expressed as a ratio to urine creatinine levels (to normalize the variations in the urine volume). Thus, in a spot urine sample, Albumin-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) can be estimated and a value of 30\u2013300 mg/g has been found to be approximately equivalent to AER of 30\u2013300 mg/day.\nGlucose\nTrace Negative Small Moderate LargeTrace\n6.5 6.0 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5\u00b1+ +\n+ ++ +++++ +++\n\u00b1Neg.\nNeg.\n5.0\nNeg.Protein\npH\nBloodTrace\nFigure 48.8\nUrine dipstick.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   835 24-10-2020   12:14:47"

RBCs and hemoglobin:  Presence of heme in the urine (hemo-\nglobinuria) is detected by utilizing the peroxidase activity of heme, which changes the color of a chromogen.

BUN-serum creatinine ratio:  The glomerular filtration of both \nurea and creatinine is decreased due to hypoperfusion in prer-enal azotemia. However, urea is reabsorbed in increased amounts due to the activation of urea transporter by increased ADH levels in hypovolemia. Thus, the ratio between urea and creatinine is increased in prerenal azotemia. A BUN/serum creatinine of >20:1 is suggestive of prerenal azotemia, while the ratio is 10\u201315:1 in intrarenal azotemia. \n b.  The term Fractional Excretion of sodium (or FENa) refers to the \npercentage of sodium that is filtered by the kidneys, which is excreted in the urine.

Most of the cases of AKI and advanced CKD are associated with electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities, which can be diagnosed by estimation of serum Na\n+ and K+, and arterial blood gas analysis, respectively. Bone \nabnormalities in kidney disease requires estimation of serum Ca2+, \nphosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D levels, and alka-\nline phosphatase , for assessment. Urinary tract infections are detected \nby urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Some infections like tuberculosis might require molecular diagnostic testing involving nucleic acid amplification. Calculi in kidneys and urinary tract are mostly diag-nosed by imaging studies. Etiology of calculi (e.g., uric acid calculi, and cystine stones\u2014see Fig. 24.6), are diagnosed by biochemical tests and microscopy. Most of the postrenal causes of AKI and CKD are diag-nosed by imaging studies. In prostate cancer, serum levels of a tumor marker known as PSA (prostate-specific antigen, a serine protease \npresent in prostatic tissue) are elevated. If a diagnosis cannot be made using noninvasive modalities, a renal biopsy may be required for confir-mation of the diagnosis.\nVI. FUNCTIONS OF THYROID HORMONES\nThe thyroid gland produces three hormones, viz. thyroxine (T 4) and triio-\ndothyronine (T 3) by the thyroid follicular cells, and calcitonin (by the para-\nfollicular cells or C cells). The latter is involved in calcium homeostasis (see Fig. 32.23), where it regulates the calcium resorption in the bones by cells known as osteoclasts; calcitonin ultimately decreases the plasma calcium concentration, especially in children, where osteoclastic activity is high because of rapid bone remodeling. In adults, physiological levels of calcitonin do not have a marked effect on plasma calcium levels; however, \nLIR Biochemistry.indb   837 24-10-2020   12:14:47"

Organ Function Tests\npharmacological doses of calcitonin are used in the management of \nhypercalcemia.\nThe production of T 4 and T 3 has been described in detail in Chapter 33, \nSection.IV.A, p. 560. T 3 and T 4 secretion are controlled primarily by thyroid-\nstimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) from the anterior pituitary, the release of which is in turn regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from hypothalamus. TRH is a tripeptide amide (pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline-amide) synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and is stored in the median eminence of hypothalamus. It reaches the ante-rior pituitary by hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system, where it binds to TRH receptors of the TSH-secreting cells. A signaling cascade following the binding of TRH to its receptor leads to release of TSH, which binds to the TSH receptor in the thyroid gland (\nFig. 48.10 ). TSH has multiple effects \non the thyroid gland wherein it increases the iodide trapping by activating the transporter involved in this process (Na\n+/I\u2212 symporter), it increases by \niodination of tyrosine, enhances the proteolysis of thyroglobulin to release the thyroid hormones into the circulation, and increases the number of follicular cells. \nT\n3 is the potent form (four times more potent than T 4), but >80% of the \nhormone secreted from the thyroid gland is T 4. In the circulation, T 3 and \nT4 are bound to proteins like albumin, transthyretin (transports thyroid \nhormones and retinol-binding protein), and thyroid-binding globulin. Only the protein unbound forms (known as free T\n3 and free T 4, i.e., fT 3 and fT 4) \nare available for hormonal activity and these constitute only a minute frac-tion of the total T\n3 and T 4; 99.98% of T 4 and 99.8% of T 3 in the circu-\nlation is protein bound. At the tissue site of action, T 3 and T 4 cross the \nplasma membrane to enter the cytoplasm, where the enzymes 5\u2019-deiodin-ases convert fT\n4 to fT 3, the active form. fT 3 binds to the thyroid hormone \nreceptors. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) is present in the DNA at specific hormone receptor elements, along with another receptor known as reti-noid-X-receptor (RXR). Binding of fT\n3 to the receptor complex increases \ngene transcription, and hence the synthesis of a large number of proteins, which ultimately bring about the effector functions (\nFig. 48.11 ).\nHypothalamus\nAnterior \npituitaryPosterior\npituitaryHormone \nsecreting cells of anterior pituitary\nThyroidTSH\nT\n4\nT3TRH\nFigure 48.10\nRegulation of thyroid hormone secretion.   \nTSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; TRH = thyrotropin-releasing hormone.\nNucleusCytoplasm\nProteinsDeiodinaseT4\nT3T3\nTR RXR\nDNA\nmRNA\nFigure 48.11\nMechanism of action of thyroid hormones.

            "Text": "VII. Thyroid Function Tests 839\nThe actions of thyroid hormones are diverse and numerous. Some of these \nare listed below:\n1. Effects on general metabolism:  Thyroid hormones enhance the \nnumber and the functioning of mitochondria. Thus, they stimulate the ATP production, and overall metabolism. Thyroid hormones are impor-tant in maintaining the basal metabolic rate (BMR) (see Chapter 31, Section III.B.1, p. 499). Thyroid hormones also stimulate the activity of ion channels including the Na\n+-K+ ATPase . Since this pump utilizes ATP , \nand thyroid hormones increase the ATP production in the mitochondria, there is an overall increased recycling of ATP . Since ATP production is only ~30% efficient and the rest of the energy during the process is dissipated mostly as heat, thyroid hormones play an important role in thermogenesis and thus, maintenance of body temperature. Thyroxine also acts as an uncoupler, and also increases the levels of uncoupling protein, UCP1, in the brown adipose tissue, contributing further to ther-mogenesis (see Chapter 11, Section VI.A.2.c and Fig. 11.16, p. 170).  \n2. Effects on carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism:  Thyroid \nhormones stimulate carbohydrate metabolism by promoting insulin secretion and uptake of glucose into tissues, and by stimulating glycol-ysis as well as gluconeogenesis. Lipid catabolism is also enhanced\u2014thyroid hormones stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue, and \u03b2-oxidation \nof fatty acids. By increasing the expression of LDL-receptor, thyroid hormones decrease the cholesterol levels in the circulation. Thyroid hormones also promote protein catabolism and muscle protein breakdown.\n3. Effects on cardiovascular system:  Thyroid hormones have a direct \nstimulatory effect on cardiac activity. Also, they increase expression of catecholamine receptors, enhancing the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the heart. Thyroid hormones increase heart rate and cardiac output, thus increasing the oxygen supply to the peripheral tissues to promote the intermediary metabolism.\n4. Effect on nervous system:  Thyroid hormones are essential for the \nnormal development of nervous system. Hypothyroidism during intra-uterine life and early childhood can lead to intellectual disability. Thyroid hormones increase the activity of neuronal synapses, decrease sleep, and increase skeletal muscle activity and intestinal motility.\nThe feedback regulation of thyroid secretion is shown in \nFig. 48.10 . The \nsecretion of TSH is inhibited directly by the thyroid hormones by their action on the anterior pituitary, as well as indirectly by their effect on TRH release. Even small changes in thyroid hormone levels can affect the TSH levels to a larger extent. This is important while assessing the thyroid func-tion using hormone assays.\nVII. THYROID FUNCTION TESTS\nHypothyroidism refers to a reduction in the thyroid hormone levels in the circulation. Based on the organ affected, hypothyroidism can be primary (defect lies in the thyroid gland), secondary (defect in the pituitary), or tertiary (defect in the hypothalamus). The causes are listed in \nFigure 48.12 . \nClinical features of hypothyroidism include lethargy, weight gain, increased sleep, exhaustion, cold intolerance, constipation, decreased heart rate, abnormal tendon reflexes, delayed growth and development (in children), etc. Severe hypothyroidism can even result in a comatose state.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   839 24-10-2020   12:14:47"

Hyperthyroidism mostly occurs \ndue to a defect at the level of thyroid gland, or due to exogenous intake of iodine or thyroid hormones. Clinical features are mostly diametrically oppo-site to that of hypothyroidism and include restlessness, weight loss, sleep-lessness, anxiety, heat intolerance, diarrhea, tachycardia, and increased tendon reflexes. Persistent hyperthyroidism can lead to arrythmias and heart failure.\nThe diagnosis of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism is confirmed by hormone \nassays. The following are some considerations in the biochemical diag-nosis of thyroid diseases:\n1. Thyroid function tests classically comprise of estimations of serum levels \nof TSH, fT\n3, and fT 4. These are estimated using special immunoassays. \n2. Although the major fractions of T 3 and T 4 are in the protein-bound form, \nthe biologically active form is the free hormones (denoted by fT 3 and \nfT4). Also, numerous factors like illnesses, medications, and genetic \nfactors can influence the protein binding of thyroid hormones. Hence, fT\n3 and fT 4 estimation is preferred over the assay of total T 3 and total T 4.\n3. The most important test for diagnosing thyroid dysfunction is serum \nTSH. A normal TSH virtually rules out thyroid hormone abnormalities. Thus, the diagnostic algorithms for workup of hypo- and hyperthy-roidism start with estimation of serum TSH. \n4. Since most of the thyroid hormone abnormalities can be detected \nusing fT\n4 alone, fT 3 estimation has only a very limited role among the \nthyroid function tests.

Functions of the Adrenal Gland 841\nT3-toxicosis\u2014a condition where TSH is low and fT4 is normal; it is seen \nin toxic nodular goiter and Graves\u2019 disease, due to increased conver-sion of T\n4 to T 3.\n5. In primary hypothyroidism, fT 4 is reduced and as the result of removal \nof the feedback inhibition on pituitary, TSH is elevated. In secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is reduced as a result of pituitary defects, leading to decreased stimulation of thyroid gland and hence decreased fT\n4 \n(Fig. 48.10 ). A similar finding is seen in hypothalamic disorders (tertiary \nhypothyroidism) also, but this is rare. If suspected, a reduction in TRH levels points to tertiary hypothyroidism.\n6. If TSH is high, but fT\n4 is normal, the condition is termed as subclinical \nhypothyroidism. Most of such patients are asymptomatic; however, a large number of them progress to overt hypothyroidism. Such patients should be followed up with estimations of TSH and fT\n4, and treatment \nshould be started, like in hypothyroidism, if TSH levels are too high.\n7. In hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting tumor of pituitary, TSH and \nfT4 are elevated. In hyperthyroidism arising to due thyroid or exogenous \ncauses, fT 4 is elevated but TSH is suppressed by the feedback inhibi-\ntion ( Fig. 48.10 ). One exception is T 3-toxicosis (see point 4). The other \nexception is subclinical hyperthyroidism where TSH is low, but both fT 4 \nas well as fT 3 is normal. Such patients should be followed up, as they \ncan develop frank hyperthyroidism; treatment, as in hyperthyroidism, should be initiated if TSH values are too low.\n8. \nFigure 48.13  gives a flowchart for the diagnosis of hypo- and hyperthy-\nroidism based on the thyroid function tests.\nSome other investigations are important in identifying the etiology of the \nthyroid diseases. Graves\u2019 disease is an autoimmune disease with autoan-tibodies that stimulate the TSH receptors in the thyroid gland, as well as autoimmune reactions involving the periorbital tissue. The latter leads to a typical clinical feature of Graves\u2019 disease\u2014exophthalmos (Fig. 33.16). Apart from thyroid function tests, TSH receptor-binding immunoglobulins can also be assayed for diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease. Another autoimmune disease is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid, and this eventually leads to hypothyroidism. Serum anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibodies are elevated in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroid-itis. Serum calcitonin is used as a tumor marker in medullary carcinoma of thyroid, which is a tumor that arises from the parafollicular cells (or C cells); monitoring calcitonin levels after treatment is important to detect the recurrence of the tumor. Similarly, serum thyroglobulin levels are used in following up patients with thyroid malignancies who underwent thyroidec-tomies, for detection of residual disease and tumor recurrence.\nVIII. FUNCTIONS OF THE ADRENAL GLAND\nThe adrenal gland is made of two embryologically and functionally distinct, yet anatomically proximal regions\u2014adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex. \nA. Adrenal medulla\nThe adrenal medulla forms one-fifth of the gland and is closely associ-ated with the sympathetic nervous system. It receives nerve innervation from the centers in brainstem and spinal cord, and in response to stimuli produces catecholamine hormones\u2014norepinephrine and epinephrine.

Note that the degra-dation products of epinephrine and norepinephrine are metaneph-rine/normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). Apart from the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine is also synthesized by the sympathetic nerve endings. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate their effects by binding to cell surface receptors known as adrenergic receptors (\u03b1\n1, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22)\u2014these are G-protein coupled receptors, and bring about \ntheir actions with the help of second messengers including, but not limited to, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Norepinephrine binds mostly to the \u03b1-adrenergic receptor, with minor binding to the \u03b2 \nreceptors; epinephrine binds to both the receptors with almost equal affinity. These receptors have a widespread tissue distribution, hence the diverse actions of these hormones. For example: \n\u2022 \u03b1\n1 receptor is present on vascular smooth muscles stimulation of \nwhich leads to vasoconstriction (and increase in blood pressure).\n\u2022 \u03b1 2 receptor is present in nerve terminals, where it inhibits release of \nnorepinephrine.\n\u2022 \u03b2 1 receptor is present in the myocardium, and stimulation leads to \nincreased heart rate and myocardial contractility (thus increasing the cardiac output and blood pressure). In adipose tissue, activa-tion of this receptor leads to activation of hormone-sensitive lipase  \nand lipolysis. \n\u2022 \u03b2\n2 receptor is present in bronchial smooth muscle and activation of \nthis receptor leads to bronchodilation. The receptor also leads to activation of glycogenolysis in the liver.\nTo summarize, action of epinephrine and norepinephrine prepares the \nbody for a \u201cfight or flight\u201d reaction by increasing the blood supply to the muscles, increasing energy production by glycogenolysis and lipolysis, and so on. Many drugs acting on the adrenergic receptors are in clin-ical use\u2014bronchodilators used in patients with bronchial asthma acti-vate \u03b2\n2 receptor, \u03b21 receptor blockers are used in the management of \nhypertension, and nasal decongestants activate \u03b11 receptor. Adrenaline \n(epinephrine) as such is used as a lifesaving drug in cardiac arrest, and in anaphylaxis (which is a severe form of allergic reaction characterized by vasodilation and low blood pressure, and severe bronchoconstriction).\nB. Adrenal cortex\nThe adrenal cortex forms four-fifths of the adrenal gland and is made of three histologically distinct zones\u2014zona glomerulosa (which secretes mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone), zona fasciculata (which secretes glucocorticoids, principally cortisol), and zona reticu-laris (which produces androgens and some amount of estrogen). All these hormones are synthesized from cholesterol and have a steroid ring in their structure. The synthesis of these hormones are given in Chapter 23, Section VII.A, p. 360 and their regulation in Chapter 23, Section VII.B, p. 361 and Chapter 5, Section III.C, p. 56.\nIn brief, cortisol production and androgen production are regulated \nby adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. The ACTH secretion is controlled by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the cell membrane G-protein coupled receptors of the adreno-cortical cells, and activates the enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis (\nFig. 48.14 ).

Functions of the Adrenal Gland 843\nto CRH release and cortisol synthesis\u2014cortisol is hence considered as \nthe \u201cstress hormone.\u201d Cortisol has an inhibitory effect on ACTH and CRH formation in pituitary and hypothalamus, respectively.\nACTH also stimulates the initial steps of mineralocorticoid production. \nOtherwise, mineralocorticoid synthesis and secretion are increased by angiotensin II which is a part of the RAAS, and also by increased potas-sium levels in the extracellular fluid (ECF). Aldosterone increases Na\n+ \nreabsorption and K+ excretion, thus maintaining ECF volume and ECF \nNa+ levels, leading to decreased renin levels, thus negatively regulating \nits own secretion.\nSince the hormones from adrenal cortex are lipophilic, they are trans-\nported in the circulation in a protein-bound form\u201490%\u201395% of cortisol in the circulation is bound to cortisol-binding globulin and albumin; 60% of aldosterone also binds to plasma proteins. Free form is usually detected in hormone assays. Many of the adrenocortical hormones also show a diurnal variation in the secretion, e.g., cortisol levels are the highest during the morning hours, soon after waking up.\nFunctions of the adrenocortical hormones are summarized below:\n 1. Cortisol:  Effects of cortisol span a huge spectrum:\n a.  Cortisol leads to increased plasma glucose levels by promoting \ngluconeogenesis and diminishing glucose utilization by tissues.\n b.  Cortisol increases protein synthesis by the liver, but for this the \namino acids are mobilized from other peripheral tissues. This leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and increased protein catabolism in peripheral tissues\u2014increased cortisol levels cause muscle wasting.\n c.  Cortisol also promotes lipolysis and \u03b2 oxidation of fatty acids, \nbut this action is tissue specific. Excess of cortisol indeed promotes obesity.\n d.  Cortisol has a potent anti-inflammatory and immune suppres-\nsion effect. For example, cortisol inhibits phospholipase A\n2 \nand thus inhibits release of arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis. Corticosteroids are hence used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases.\n e.  Cortisol also has a weak mineralocorticoid effect as it can bind \nweakly to the mineralocorticoid receptor. \n 2. Aldosterone:  Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium \nand secretion of potassium by the renal tubules. By reabsorbing sodium, aldosterone maintains the ECF volume. Detailed mecha-nism of the action of aldosterone on the renal tubules is given in Chapter 5, Section III.C, p. 56. Aldosterone is also involved in renal regulation of pH, as it promotes secretion of H\n+ into the tubular fluid \n(see Chapter 4, Table 2).\n 3.  Adrenal androgens, the most important being dehydroepiandros-\nterone have only a weak effect as such, are probably involved in the development of male sex organs. Peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens to testosterone is responsible for most of the effects of these hormones.\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   843 24-10-2020   12:14:48"

TESTS FOR ADRENAL FUNCTION\nThe most common disorder of the adrenal medulla is the presence of a \nrelatively rare catecholamine-secreting tumor, known as pheochromo-cytoma (the tumor when stained with chromium salts gives a dark color, hence the name \u2013 phio: dark,  chroma : color,  cytoma : tumor). 10% of these \ntumors are malignant. It is clinically characterized by the features of sympa-thetic stimulation\u2014palpitation, sweating, anxiety, headache, weight loss, hypertension and arrythmias. The diagnosis is made by estimating meta-nephrine in plasma, and 24-hour urine excretion of metanephrine and VMA. Localization of the tumor is done by imaging studies.\nThe rest of this section will focus on the disorders of adrenal cortex, and \nthe tests used in their diagnosis. \nA. Tests for cushing\u2019s syndrome\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is characterized by an excess of cortisol in the circulation. The clinical manifestations include weight gain and obesity, lethargy, muscle weakness, edema, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia and hypokalemia. The causes can be exogenous corti-costeroid administration (e.g., in patients with autoimmune diseases), ACTH secretion by a pituitary adenoma (this is termed Cushing\u2019s disease), ectopic ACTH production by tumors outside the pituitary (e.g., small cell lung carcinoma), and tumors of the adrenal cortex (adenoma and carcinoma). Establishing the diagnosis and the underlying etiology is critical in the management of Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nAn increased salivary cortisol levels or 24-hour urine free cortisol levels \nis suggestive of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Diagnosis can also be estab-lished by performing a low-dose (1 mg) dexamethasone suppres-sion test. Dexamethasone is a highly potent synthetic corticosteroid; 1 mg of this drug is administered at midnight and serum cortisol is measured at 8 AM the next morning. In normal individuals, dexameth-asone suppresses the hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH produc-tion, resulting in decreased cortisol levels. This is not seen in Cushing\u2019s syndrome at low doses of dexamethasone.\nThe first step in establishing the cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is the \nestimation of plasma ACTH. In adrenal tumors, ACTH will be decreased due to the feedback inhibition by high cortisol levels. A high ACTH is seen in pituitary tumors and in ectopic ACTH production. The differenti-ation between these is achieved by a high-dose (8 mg) dexamethasone suppression test. The principle of the test is that in excess production of ACTH by the pituitary, a high dose of dexamethasone suppresses the ACTH, and thus cortisol levels; this negative feedback is not seen with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. Thus, after a midnight adminis-tration of 8 mg dexamethasone, if plasma cortisol is suppressed, the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s disease is highly likely. \nThe tests in Cushing\u2019s syndrome are summarized in a flowchart in \nFig. 48.15 .\nB. Tests for adrenal insufficiency\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by a decrease in the cortisol and \naldosterone levels in the circulation. The clinical manifestations include weakness and fatigue, weight loss, dehydration, hypotension, hypo-glycemia, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

Laboratory diagnosis involves establishing the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and establishing the cause. \nDiagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made by the demonstration of \nlow circulating cortisol levels\u2014this can be done by estimating serum cortisol levels in the early morning (6 AM) or by estimating morning salivary cortisol levels. If cortisol levels are normal, a short ACTH stim-ulation test will help in the diagnosis. This involved administration of 250 \u03bcg of cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH, with 24 amino acids, which is shorter than ACTH which has 39 amino acids) and monitoring the changes in serum cortisol levels before, and at 60 minutes of admin-istration. A failure of the serum cortisol to increase after cosyntropin administration is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. \nThe cause of adrenal insufficiency can be identified by measuring \nplasma ACTH, renin, and aldosterone levels. In Addison\u2019s disease, ACTH and renin levels are increased due to absence of negative feed-back by cortisol and aldosterone, and aldosterone levels are decreased. Since the aldosterone production is more dependent on RAAS than ACTH, in secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, renin and aldo-sterone levels are normal despite a decrease in the ACTH level. From a treatment point of view, distinction between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency is not important.\nThe tests in adrenal insufficiency are summarized in a flowchart in \nFig. 48.16 .\nC. Tests for mineralocorticoid excess\nIncreased plasma aldosterone levels lead to hypernatremia and hypo-\nkalemia. In primary hyperaldosteronism, the level of defect is in the adrenals.

In secondary hyperaldosteronism, the defect is in the renal \nlevel (e.g., decreased renal blood flow leading to increased renin levels, or a renin-producing tumor); both renin and aldosterone levels will be elevated in such conditions.\nX. Medical Perspectives\nThis section describes some additional medical perspectives in relation to the organ functions and tests described in \nthis chapter.\n\u2022 Acute phase reactants: These are the serum proteins the levels of which increase or decrease by 25% in presence \nof acute or chronic inflammation. They are produced by the liver, and their synthesis is altered in response to various molecules like cytokines that are associated with inflammation. The proteins whose levels are increased in inflamma-tion are termed positive acute phase reactants, and examples are C-reactive protein, ferritin, complement proteins, ceruloplasmin, etc. Negative acute phase proteins have their serum concentrations reduced during inflammation and include albumin, transthyretin, retinol-binding protein, and transferrin.\n\u2022 We have seen that in alcoholic hepatitis, serum AST levels are higher than ALT levels. Thus, an AST/ALT >2 is sugges-\ntive of alcohol use disorder. It was also explained that GGT is elevated because of alcohol intake, due to induction of \nthe microsomal isoenzyme and alcohol-induced leakage of the enzyme from the cell. Thus, serum AST/ALT and GGT \nact as markers of alcohol use disorder. Other markers include serum ethanol levels and serum carbohydrate-defi-cient transferrin (CDT) levels. Transferrin is normally glycosylated by addition of sialic acid residues, and this process is impaired in chronic alcoholics, leading to increase in CDT levels.\n\u2022 5\u2019-deiodinases which are involved in peripheral conversion of T\n4 to the active form, i.e., T 3 are selenium dependent \nenzymes. The activity of the enzymes is thus impaired in selenium deficiency, leading to hypothyroidism. 5\u2019-deiodinase \nis also a target of certain drugs that are used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, e.g., propranolol and propylthiouracil.\n\u2022 During a nuclear fallout, one of the radioactive isotopes that is released into the atmosphere is I131. Uptake of this \nradioactive isotope by thyroid tissue can lead to the increased concentration of this isotope in thyroid gland, leading to future thyroid malignancies. Intake of normal iodine (in the form of potassium iodide) can prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the gland, and this forms the basis of iodide supplementation during a nuclear fallout.

In most scenarios, more than one \nbiochemical test is required for this purpose to be achieved. Functions, disorders, and tests for four organs\u2014liver, kidney, thyroid, and adrenals, were discussed in this chapter.\nThe liver has important functions in metabolism of macro- and micromolecules. It also synthesizes a large number of \nplasma proteins including albumin and clotting factors and is involved in detoxification of xenobiotics and endogenous molecules. Liver tests include those for hepatocellular injury\u2014the transaminases , enzyme and non-enzyme markers of \ncholestasis, biomarkers for synthetic functions of liver, markers of viral hepatitis, etc. (\nFig. 48.17 ).\nFunctions of the kidneys can include excretion of metabolic waste products, homeostasis of water, electrolytes and pH, \nand production of hormones like renin, erythropoietin, and calcitriol. Glomerular function is assessed by indirect markers of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) like serum cystatin and serum creatinine. Formulas are available for calculation of esti-mated GFR using these parameters. Prerenal and intrarenal azotemias can be distinguished by fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-serum creatine ratio. Other tests for identifying the etiology of renal diseases include detection of proteinuria, albumin excretion rate, and urine analysis for detection of other abnormal analytes.\nThyroid hormones play a key role in metabolism and general functioning of the body. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \nregulates the thyroid hormone production. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by thyroid function tests, of which TSH is the most important.\nAdrenal medulla produces catecholamine hormones\u2014their level is elevated in pheochromocytoma. Adrenal cortex \nproduces cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens. Hyperfunctioning of the cortex can be detected by suppression tests, while adrenal insufficiency can be diagnosed by stimulation tests. \nParameter\nDirect bilirubin\nIndirect bilirubin\nAST\nALT\nALP\n5\u00b4-NT\nGGTIncreased\nIncreased\nIncreased\nIncreased\nMild increase\nMild increase\nMild increaseHepatocellular damage\nIncreased\nNormal\nNormal\nNormal\nIncreased\nIncreased\nIncreasedExtrahepatic cholestasis\nImaging studies for diagnosisExtrahepatic cholestasis\n\u2022 Gallstones\n\u2022 Carcinoma head of pancreas\u2022 Periampullary carcinoma\n\u2022 Cirrhosis\u2022 Chronic viral \n   hepatitis\n\u2022 NASH\u2022 Alcoholic hepatitis\u2022 Acute viral hepatitis\u2022 Toxins/drug induced\u2022 Ischemic damageHepatocellular damage\nSerum albumin\nNormal Low\nFigure 48.17\nKey concept map \u2013 diagnosis of liver diseases.

How can the transaminase levels be used to identify the cause of liver dysfunction?\nClinical Case Questions \nAnswer\u2014A:  Acute viral hepatitis, most likely hepatitis \nA. Clues to diagnosis include presence of fever which suggests infection, and presence of pain in the hypochon-drium which suggests inflammation of the liver. Elevation of both direct and indirect bilirubin suggests hepatocel-lular jaundice, and severe elevation of transaminases is seen in hepatocellular injury. Absence of sexual contact, recent surgery, blood transfusion, and injections may point to feco-oral transmission\u2014that is hepatitis A and E, but hepatitis E is most commonly seen in pregnant females.48.1. A 21-year-old student was admitted to the \nhospital after he developed yellowish discolor-ation of the skin and sclera and low-grade fever. He reported that he had nausea and vomiting for the past 10 days and a decreased appetite. On examination, he had fever of 102 \u00b0F . Abdominal \nexamination revealed tenderness in the right hypochondrium. The urine was high colored. The total serum bilirubin was 7.2 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.0 mg/dl, AST 1,723 IU/l and ALT 2,675 IU/l. He denied history of sexual contact, recent surgery, blood transfusion, and injections. \nA. What is the most likely diagnosis? \nAnswer\u2014B:  Elevated, but only 2\u20134 times the upper refer-\nence limit. The inflammation associated with hepatitis leads to intrahepatic cholestasis, and an elevation in the serum ALP levels.\nB. What could be the serum ALP level in this \npatient? Why?\nAnswer\u2014C:  The liver dysfunction in hepatitis impairs the \nconjugation of bilirubin, leading to increased unconju-gated bilirubin in the circulation. Increase in conjugated bilirubin is due to intrahepatic cholestasis. Transaminases are elevated due to their release from the hepatocytes as a result of hepatocellular injury.C. What is the reason behind elevated bilirubin \nand transaminases?\nAnswer\u2014D:  By performing an ELISA for serum anti-hepa-\ntitis A virus (HAV) IgM. Elevated levels suggest a recent hepatitis A infection.D. How is the diagnosis confirmed?\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   848 24-10-2020   12:14:50"

            "Text": "Study Questions 849\nAnswer\u2014A:  Primary hypothyroidism, most likely \nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. The symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and drowsiness, as well as signs like bradycardia, delayed tendon reflexes, and neck swelling are indicative of thyroid disease and hypothy-roidism. A low fT\n4 and a high TSH further confirms primary \nhypothyroidism. Elevated anti-TPO antibodies suggest Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.48.2. A 32-year-old female was at her doctor\u2019s office \nwith the chief complaints of fatigue, and weight gain despite a poor appetite. She attributed this to her inability to keep up with her normal routine workouts due to loss of energy and overall sleep-iness even throughout the day. She also had complaints of feeling cold all the time and difficulty swallowing and said that her throat feels swollen. \n The doctor noticed that she looked depressed \nand had a hard time concentrating while questions were being asked. Examination revealed a pulse rate of 58 beats per minute and coarse dry skin. Her tendon reflexes showed a markedly delayed relaxation phase. Palpation of the neck revealed a non-tender, irregular, firm swelling front of neck, which moves downwards with swallowing. \n Laboratory investigations revealed serum TSH: 23 \nmIU/l (Reference limits: 0.35\u20136.20 mIU/l), serum free T4: 6.44 pmol/l (reference limits: 9.00\u201323.12 pmol/l), elevated levels of TPO antibodies and serum total cholesterol of 255 mg/dl.\nA. What is the most probable diagnosis?\nAnswer\u2014B:  Free T 4, rather than bound form is the one \nthat enters the cells to get converted into the active T 3. \nAlso, the levels of bound forms are altered by the levels of the proteins to which T\n4 binds, which is affected by \nillnesses and medications.\nB. What is the advantage of estimating free T 4 \nover total T 4 in a patient with thyroid disease?Answer\u2014C: TSH. A normal TSH level rules out thyroid \nhormone abnormality. TSH levels are highly sensitive to small alterations in T\n3 and T 4 and is the first to change in \nthyroid diseases. Thus, performing TSH alone as the first step in diagnosis is much cost effective.\nC. If you are given a choice of performing a single \ntest to assess the thyroid function, which test will you prefer? Why? Answer\u2014D:  Expression of LDL-receptors requires the \naction of thyroid hormones. In hypothyroidism, a reduc-tion in the number of LDL-receptors leads to decreased clearance of cholesterol from the circulation.\nD. What is the reason for elevated serum total \ncholesterol in this patient?Answer\u2014E:  Graves\u2019 disease presents as hyperthy-\nroidism. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis during the initial phase (when there is associated thyroid follicle damage) also can cause hyperthyroidism, but hypothyroidism sets in as the disease progresses.\nE. Name two common autoimmune diseases \naffecting the thyroid gland. How do they differ in the clinical presentation?\nCorrect answer = C.  Normal albumin, \u2191Prothrombin \ntime. In liver disease, the synthetic capacity of the liver is reduced. Thus, the synthesis of both albumin and prothrombin are reduced. However due to a relatively long half-life of albumin, the reduction is apparent only in chronic liver diseases. A decreased prothrombin time increases the time required for the sample to clot, during the estimation of prothrombin time. Note: Increased serum \nalbumin is very unusual and is mostly due to a laboratory error. It is seen sometimes in severe dehydration.Multiple Choice Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\n48.1. Which of the following scenarios is the most \nconsistent with a diagnosis of acute liver disease?\nA. \u2193serum albumin, Normal prothrombin time\nB. \u2193serum albumin, \u2191Prothrombin time\nC.

Prerenal azotemia \nmostly results from hypovolemia and hypotension with a reduction in the glomerular perfusion. Both serum urea (hence, BUN) and serum creatinine levels are elevated due to impaired glomerular filtration. The increase in BUN is significantly higher than creatinine, because of the passive reabsorption of urea in the tubules, which is increased by increased ADH in hypovolemia. The kidneys try to conserve sodium and maintain ECF volume, thus frac-tional excretion of sodium or FENa is decreased.48.2. Which of the following is NOT a feature of pre-\nrenal azotemia?\nA. Low blood pressure\nB. Increased BUN/serum creatinineC. Increased FENaD. Increased serum creatinine\nCorrect answer = D.  Multiple myeloma. Overflow protein-\nuria occurs due to an increase in the production or release of a proteins, which then gets filtered in increased amounts by the glomeruli, resulting in their increased presence in the urine. In multiple myeloma, this is due to excess produc-tion of immunoglobin light chains, which due to their low molecular weight get excreted in the urine (Bence-Jones proteinuria). Diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis cause glomerular proteinuria, while nephrotoxic drugs usually cause tubular proteinuria.48.3. Which of the following conditions is associated \nwith overflow proteinuria?\nA. Diabetic nephropathy\nB. Nephrotoxic drugsC. GlomerulonephritisD. Multiple myeloma\nCorrect answer = B.  Conn\u2019s syndrome. A mineralocor-\nticoid producing tumor will lead to an increase in aldo-sterone and a feedback inhibition of renin production. Aldosterone levels and renin levels are normal in condi-tions of glucocorticoid excess (options A, C, and D), though cortisol has a weak mineralocorticoid action. 48.4.

            "Text": "CLINICAL RELEVANCE FOR PRIMARY HEALTHCARE \nPHYSICIANS\nPharmaceutical agents constitute the major xenobiotic group to which \nhumans are exposed. Besides phase 1 and phase 2 transformation, active membrane transporters that function to shuttle drugs and other xenobiotics across cellular membranes also play an important role in xenobiotic metab-olism. Drugs that diffuse passively across the apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells can be extruded back into the intestinal lumen by trans-porters or vice versa. Apart from human enzymes, gut bacterial community (microbiome) also metabolize xenobiotics and can significantly modulate drug bioavailability for orally administered drugs. \nDrugs, such as rifampicin, which induce cytochrome P450 (CYP450), can \nalter the metabolism, and therefore, the pharmacological effect or adverse effect of coadministered drugs. Adverse reactions of several drugs, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin (anticancer drugs) and azathioprine (antiretroviral) are mediated though oxidative stress. Increased hemolysis due to anti-malarial drugs (quinine, chloroquine and primaquine), seen in G6PD defi-ciency, is also mediated through oxidative stress (see Chapter 18, V. G6PD deficiency, p. 257). Free radicals also have several beneficial roles when maintained at low concentrations. Phagocytes synthesize free radicals for destruction of invading pathogens. Defective nicotinamide adenine dinu-cleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system leads to inability to produce O\n2\u2212, causing granulomatous disease. Free radicals, such as nitric oxide \n(NO), are also involved in a number of cellular signaling pathways.\nIn India, there is a National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancers, \nDiabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) which focuses on health promotion through behavior change, opportunistic screening at all levels in the healthcare delivery system and management of chronic non-communicable diseases, especially cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and stroke. Also, National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) is being run by the Indian Council of Medical Research, with the objectives of obtaining an overview of patterns of cancer in different parts of the country and to calculate estimates of cancer incidence.\nWhen prescribing chemotherapy to cancer patients, the probability of \nhyperuricemia should be considered and appropriate preventive steps should to be taken (see Chapter 34, V.C: Diseases associated with purine degradation, p. 581). An upcoming treatment for cancer is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, in which a patient\u2019s T cells are modified to express a receptor against certain protein on the patient\u2019s cancer cells. Such CAR T-cells can attack cancer cells and destroy them.Appendix\nUnit X: Special Topics\nLIR Biochemistry.indb   851 24-10-2020   12:14:50"
