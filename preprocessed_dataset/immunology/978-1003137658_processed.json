            "Text": "Preface\nThis book serves three different functions. It provides a concise \noverview of basic immunology for readers who have not studied \nthe subject previously, but need an understanding of the subject \nto support undergraduate or postgraduate work. It can also be \nused as a reference for science and medical students who have \nstudied immunology, but require a refresher on specific content \nor to aid revision for exams. Finally, the book can be used as a \ndictionary of immunological terms.\nReaders who already know some immunology and require a sum -\nmary of particular aspects should consult the contents pages. The \nbook is divided into five sections, each of which contains a number \nof related topics that are generally set out on double-page spreads. \nThese topics are arranged in a logical sequence, so that Sections \n1\u20133 are a short course in basic immunology, Section 4 provides \nthe basis for clinical immunology, and Section 5 outlines important \nimmunological techniques.\nTo use the book as a dictionary, look up the word or abbreviation \nin the \u201cIndex of Terms.\u201d This gives a single page number where a \ndefinition of the word will be found; associated terms can be found \non the same page. Page references to particular topics set out over \nseveral pages are indicated in bold. Items found as entries in tables \nare given in italics.\nThis edition of the book has been fully revised to highlight the latest \nunderstanding of the subject, particularly in the areas of therapeu -\ntic antibodies, innate immune defenses, and control of immune \nresponses. Naturally, a book of this kind cannot include everything \nof interest to immunologists. I have tried to cover all essential areas \nof the subject, but I should be pleased to know when readers con -\nsider that particular subjects deserve further coverage.\nI am most grateful to colleagues, acknowledged in the figure leg -\nends, who have allowed me to use micrographs or photographs. \nFor this edition, I am very pleased to have worked with a new edito -\nrial team, including Jo Koster and Jordan Wearing at CRC Press/\nTaylor & Francis and I also thank the illustrator, Nigel Orme."

            "Text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe immune system has evolved to protect the body from damage \ncaused by microorganisms\u2014bacteria, fungi, viruses, and para -\nsites. This defensive function is performed by leukocytes (white \nblood cells) and a number of accessory cells, which are distributed \nthroughout the body but are found particularly in lymphoid organs, \nincluding the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and mucosa-associ -\nated lymphoid tissues (MALT). Lymphoid organs are strategically \nplaced to protect different areas of the body from infection. Cells \nmigrate between these tissues via the bloodstream and lymphatic \nsystem. As they do so they interact with each other to generate \ncoordinated immune responses, aimed at eliminating pathogens or \nminimizing the damage they cause.\nLymphocytes  are key cells controlling the immune response. They do \nso by recognizing molecules produced by pathogens. They can also \nrecognize molecules on the cells of the body, although they do not \nnormally react against the body\u2019s own tissues. Molecules recognized \nby lymphocytes are referred to as \u201cantigens.\u201d Lymphocytes are of two \nmain types: B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which have \na number of functions, including (1) helping B cells to make antibodies; \n(2) recognizing and destroying cells that have become infected with \nintracellular pathogens; (3) activating phagocytes to destroy pathogens \nthat they have taken up, and (4) regulating the level and quality of the \nimmune response. Lymphocytes recognize foreign material by specific \ncell-surface antigen receptors. To recognize the enormous variety of dif -\nferent molecules, the antigen receptors must be equally diverse. Each \nlymphocyte makes only one type of antigen receptor and thus can only \nrecognize a very limited number of antigens, but as the receptors dif -\nfer on each clone of cells, the lymphocyte population, as a whole, can \nrecognize a vast range of different antigens. A third population of lym -\nphocytes, the innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) do not have specific antigen \nreceptors but generate a variety of immune defense functions.\nPhagocytes  include blood monocytes, macrophages, and neu -\ntrophils. They can internalize (phagocytose) pathogens, antigens, \nand cell debris and break them down. Antibodies and various other \nimmune recognition molecules bound to the pathogens facilitate \nthis process. Macrophages can also process and present antigens, \nso that they can be recognized by T cells.The Immune System1"

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogenous group, \nwhich can carry out many of the functions of T cells\u2014the group \nincludes natural killer (NK) cells.\nLarge granular lymphocytes (LGLs)  are morphologically defined \ncells containing large amounts of cytoplasm, with azurophilic gran -\nules, which constitute 5\u201315% of the blood T cells. Both NK cells \nand \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have this morphology.\nT cells  are lymphocytes that develop in the thymus. This organ is \nseeded by lymphocytic stem cells from the bone marrow during \nembryonic development. The cells then develop their T-cell antigen \nreceptors (TCR) and differentiate into the two major peripheral T-cell \nsubsets; the helper T cells express CD4, and the cytotoxic T cells \nexpress CD8. T cells can also be differentiated into two populations \naccording to whether they use an a \u03b2 (TCR2) or a \u03b3\u03b4 (TCR1) antigen \nreceptor. The essential role of T cells is to recognize antigens asso -\nciated with cells of the host.\n\u03b3\u03b4 T cells  express the \u03b3\u03b4 form of the T-cell receptor. They constitute \n<5% of the total T cells, but they are more common in particular \nsites, including the gut, skin, and vagina. They branch early from the \nmain thymic developmental pathway and recognize different anti -\ngens from \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, including carbohydrates and intact proteins.\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)  are mixed populations of cells \nfound in submucosal tissues. A total of 10\u201340% are \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, with \na dendritic appearance. The remainder are mostly CD8+ T cells.\nCytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs/T c) are capable of destroying virally \ninfected or allogeneic cells. Most CTL cells express CD8 and recognize \nantigen associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I \nmolecules, which may be expressed on all nucleated cells of the body.\nHelper T (T h) cells perform a number of functions, including help -\ning B cells to divide, differentiate, and secrete antibody, activating \nmacrophages to destroy pathogens that they have phagocytosed \nand recruiting cells to sites of inflammation. The functions are car -\nried out by different subsets of T h cells, which differentiate from \na common precursor (T h0) and can be distinguished by the cyto -\nkines, which they secrete. The majority of T h cells express CD4 and \nrecognize antigenic peptides presented on the surface of APCs by \nMHC class II molecules."

Differentiation \nof T h1 cells is promoted by interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon- \u03b3 \n(IFN\u03b3), Th2 cells by IL-4, and T h17 cells by transforming growth \nfactor- \u03b2 (TGF \u03b2) and IL-6. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting \ncells, which are most effective at presenting antigen to naive T \ncells. T h1 cells can recognize antigen presented by mononuclear \nphagocytes, and they interact with these cells by releasing IFN \u03b3, \nwhich acts as a macrophage activation factor. T h2 cells release \ncytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5, which are required for B-cell \ndevelopment into plasma cells. Both T h1 and T h2 cells can \nmodulate the antibody response by affecting the classes of immu -\nnoglobulin produced. T h17 cells release cytokines that promote \ninflammatory responses, particularly by acting on neutrophils. \nSome cell-surface markers are preferentially expressed on a sub -\nset of the helper T cells. For example, the chemokine receptors \nCCR5 and CXCR3 are more prevalent on T h1 cells, whereas CCR3 \nand CCR4 are higher on T h2 cells.

The most \nreadily accessible marker of lymphocytes is their antigen receptor. The B cell receptor (BCR) is surface immunoglobulin, whereas T cells express the TCR. Most other markers are designated accord -\ning to the CD system of nomenclature. Some of these markers are specific for individual populations of cells or particular phases of cellular differentiation. Others appear only on activated or dividing cells. Many CD markers are present at varying levels on several different cell types, so that each subset of lymphocytes expresses a unique profile of surface markers.

Some antigens are taken up by APCs in the \nperiphery and transported to the secondary lymphoid tissues, \nwhereas other APCs are resident in these tissues and intercept \nantigen as it arrives. B cells recognize antigen in its native form, \nbut T h cells recognize antigenic peptides that have become \nassociated with MHC molecules. Consequently, in order to pres -\nent antigen to a T h cell, an APC must internalize it, process it \ninto fragments and re-express it at the cell surface in association \nwith MHC class II molecules. In addition, many APCs provide \ncostimulatory signals to lymphocytes, either by direct cellular \ninteractions or by cytokines.\nDendritic cells (DCs)  are a distinct set of APCs distributed in \nmany tissues of the body, which differentiate from either myeloid \nor lymphoid precursors. Myeloid DCs (DC1) are present in epi -\ndermis, mucosal tissues, and T cell areas of secondary lymphoid \norgans. Lymphoid DCs (DC2) are confined to secondary lym -\nphoid tissues. DCs expressing MHC class II molecules migrate \nto lymph nodes via the lymphoid system carrying antigen. There \nthey upregulate costimulatory molecules required for T-cell acti -\nvation (CD40, CD80, CD86). In lymph nodes they appear as \ninterdigitating dendritic cells (IDCs) in the paracortex and they \nare very effective at presenting antigen to naive CD4+ T cells.\nLangerhans cells (Veiled cells)  are myeloid dendritic cells of \nthe skin that pick up antigen and transport it to regional lymph \nnodes. They express CD207 (langerin), CD1, and high levels of \nMHC class II molecules and they have a characteristic racket-\nshaped granule, the Birbeck granule (function unknown). In \nafferent lymph they are seen as veiled cells and in lymph nodes \nthey develop into dendritic cells. They are particularly important \nin the development of contact hypersensitivity; skin-sensitizing \nagents and UV radiation induce their emigration from the skin.\nMacrophage APCs.  Macrophages phagocytose antigen and \nsome of them can also process and present it. MHC class II \nand costimulatory molecules (B7.1/B7.2, CD80/86) are induced \nby microbial molecules acting on Toll-like receptors, allowing \nthe macrophages to present antigen effectively to T h1 cells. \nActivated macrophages also upregulate adhesion molecules \n(such as ICAM-1) and secrete IL-1.

However, most antibody functions \nrequire the antigen:antibody complex to bind to Fc receptors on cells. \nThe antigen-binding sites are formed from the V domains of a heavy \nand light chain, whereas the C domains of the Fc region interact with \ncells of the immune system and C1q of the complement system. The \ndifferent antibody classes and subclasses interact with different cells \nand so have different functions.\nIgG is the major serum Ig and constitutes the main antibody in \nsecondary immune responses to most antigens. In humans it is \ntransferred across the placenta to provide protection in neonatal \nlife. All IgG subclasses, except IgG4, can bind to C1q by sites in \nC\u03b32 to activate the complement classical pathway. IgG can act as \nan opsonin by cross-linking immune complexes to Fc receptors on \nneutrophils and macrophages. It can also sensitize target cells for \ndestruction by large granular lymphocytes with Fc receptors.\nFcRn  is the placental Fc receptor that binds all subclasses of IgG \nand transports them to the fetal circulation.\nIgM is a pentamer of the basic four-chain structure. It is the first \nclass to be produced during the development of the immune sys -\ntem and in the primary immune response. It fixes complement very \nefficiently and is the main antibody component of the response to \nT-independent antigens.\nIgD is a trace antibody in serum but acts as a cell-surface receptor \non many B cells, where it is co-expressed with IgM. IgD contributes \nto immune defense of mucosal surfaces and can act as an adapter \nfor immune recognition by mast cells and basophils.\nIgA occurs as monomers, dimers, and polymers of the basic four-\nchain unit, existing in humans mostly as monomers and in other \nspecies as dimers. IgA is the most abundant Ig class in secretions, \nwhere it protects mucous membranes. It is also found in colostrum \nand is particularly important in protecting the neonates of species \nthat do not transfer IgG across the placenta.\nJ chain  is a polypeptide present in polymeric Igs (IgM and IgA), \nwhich facilitates their polymerization. It is synthesized by B cells but \nis not encoded by the Ig genes."

Thus they provide a defense against viruses \nthat attempt to evade immune recognition by downregulating \nMHC expression on cells they have infected. They can also rec -\nognize allogeneic cells and some tumor cells. Whether an NK cell \nis activated to kill the target cell depends on the balance of acti -\nvating and inhibitory signals received. This allows the NK cell to \ninteract with cells of the body and respond to changes in their \nMHC expression or tissue damage. Immune recognition by NK \ncells is complex, since some of the receptors may be expressed \nin both activating and inhibitory forms depending on their intra -\ncellular segments.\nKiller immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)  are a family of \nreceptors that bind to MHC class I molecules and are used by \nNK cells to recognize their targets. KIRs may have two or three \nextracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and they are produced \nin two forms, an inhibitory receptor with a long cytoplasmic tail \ncontaining ITIMs (Immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motifs), and \nan activating receptor with a short cytoplasmic tail that can inter -\nact with ITAM-containing adapter molecules. As MHC molecules \nhave diversified, so have the KIRs that recognize them. There \nare several gene loci encoding KIRs (CD158). The number var -\nies between individuals and there is much polymorphism.

In general, \nliving organisms are more effective than killed ones or individual \nantigens, except in cases where the pathology is caused by a toxin \n(such as diphtheria). In this case a modified toxin or toxoid, which \nretains antigenicity but lacks pathogenicity, is preferred. Newer \nvaccines may be produced by genetic engineering. For example, \ngenes for antigens of pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis can \nbe inserted into nonpathogenic viruses such as vaccinia. It is also \npossible to insert antigen fragments that can stimulate T cells into \nsuch carrier viruses. For antigens that are only weakly immunogenic \n(such as some bacterial carbohydrates), coupling the antigen to an \nimmunogenic carrier has often been successful.

Dendritic cells can take up antigen in the periph -\nery and transport it to secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph \nnodes, etc.) for presentation to T cells. B cells and macrophages \ncan also internalize antigen, process it and present it in associ -\nation with MHC class II molecules to CD4+ Th cells. Cytokines \nproduced by activated T h2 cells stimulate B-cell growth and dif -\nferentiation into plasma cells. Other cytokines can also activate \nTc cells, APCs, and mononuclear phagocytes, thereby facilitat -\ning uptake of antigen. IgG antibodies can sensitize target cells for \nattack by NK cells. IgE antibodies can sensitize mast cells and \nbasophils to release their inflammatory mediators when they bind \nspecific antigen. Cytokines and antibodies are soluble mediators \nof cell cooperation, but leukocytes also signal directly via cell-\nsurface receptors. The most important direct interaction involves \nMHC molecules/antigen peptides contacting the T-cell recep -\ntor, but other interactions are essential for cellular cooperation, \nincluding adhesion and costimulation.\nAntigen presentation  is the process by which antigen is pre -\nsented to lymphocytes in a form they can recognize. Most CD4+ T \ncells must be presented with antigen on MHC class II molecules, \nwhereas CD8+ Tc cells recognize antigen on class I MHC mol -\necules. Antigen must be processed into peptide fragments before \nit can associate with MHC molecules. The way in which an antigen \nis processed and the type of MHC molecule it associates with \ndetermine which T cells will recognize it and whether the antigen \nis immunogenic or tolerogenic. It also affects the type of immune \nresponse generated.\nAdhesion  is an essential component of the interactions between \nleukocytes and other cells. It controls the position of the cell in \nlymphoid tissue, controls migration into tissues, and is a pre -\nrequisite for antigen presentation and many immune effector \nfunctions.\nCostimulation.  Most immune responses are initiated by antigen \ntriggering B or T cells. However, cellular activation also requires \nother signals. These may be delivered via costimulatory molecules \n(such as CD40 for B cells, CD28 for T cells) or by cytokines. This \nis sometimes called the two-signal hypothesis, in which antigen \nprovides the first signal and the other costimulatory interactions \nprovide the second signal. Cells that only receive a first signal may \nbecome anergic (tolerant) to their particular antigen."

They con -\ntrol the balance between cell-mediated responses and antibody \nproduction. Others can act as mediators of inflammation or as \ncytotoxins. Many cytokines have more than one action (pleiotropy), \nand different cells produce distinct blends of cytokines. The ability \nto respond to a cytokine depends on the expression of a specific \nreceptor. Often more than one cytokine signal is required for a \nresponse, and in this case the different cytokines act synergistically. \nHelper T cells are particularly important sources of cytokines. Most \ncytokines act on cells other than those that produced them (para -\ncrine action), but some can also stimulate the cell that produced \nthem (autocrine action).\nJAKS  and STATs.  Cytokines signal cell activation by binding to \nspecific receptors that activate intracellular signaling pathways. \nReceptors that belong to the hemopoietic cytokine receptor family are \nassociated with Janus kinases (JAKs). When the receptors become \nclustered after cytokine binding, the JAKs phosphorylate signal \ntransducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The activated \nSTATs, in association with other proteins, form transcription factors \nthat migrate to the nucleus, bind to gene promoters, and induce the \nsets of genes that are associated with the response to each of the \ncytokines. Different JAKs and STATs are used by different cytokines \nand their receptors. In the example below, the interferon- \u03b1 receptor \nis associated with JAKs Tyk2 and Jak1. These phosphorylate STAT1 \nand STAT2, which associate with p48 to form a transcription factor.\nJak1\nTyk2P P\nP PSTAT2\np48STAT1transcription\nfactor\nIFN\nreceptorIFN-\u03b1\nFig. 3.16 JAKs and STATs in cytokine receptor signaling."

This activity \nis produced by a number of molecules, including defensins and \ncathelicidins; some cationic proteins are enzymatically active.\nDefensins  are a group of small antimicrobial cytotoxic peptides that can \nbe subdivided into three families, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b8. \u03b1-Defensins are found in \nthe granules of neutrophils and macrophages in several species includ -\ning humans. \u03b2-Defensins are present in the neutrophil granules of all \nmammals and in some epithelial cells. \u03b8-Defensins are confined to pri -\nmate granulocytes. Defensins are cationic proteins with a wide spectrum \nof antibacterial and antifungal actions that act by selectively damaging \nmembranes with low levels of cholesterol and a high proportion of nega -\ntively charged phospholipids. They have some structural similarities to \nchemokines and have additional roles in opsonization and chemotaxis, \nby acting on chemokine receptors. For example, the defensin HBD-2 \nresembles CCL20, and both bind to the chemokine receptor CCR6.\nCathelicidins  are a diverse family of small polypeptides with a \ncommon cathelin domain that are stored within granules of myeloid \ncells. On activation the cathelin domain is enzymatically removed \nand the peptides are released. In addition to antimicrobial proper -\nties, some cathelicidins have chemotactic and angiogenic activity \nand promote wound healing.\nLactoferrin  is found in neutrophil granules. It binds tightly to iron, \nand deprives bacteria of this essential nutrient. Neutrophils loaded \nwith iron are inefficient at destroying bacteria.\nLysozyme  (muramidase) is an enzyme that digests a bond in \nthe cell-wall proteoglycan of some Gram-positive bacteria. It is \nsecreted constitutively by neutrophils and some macrophages \nand is present in many of the body\u2019s secretions."

Most \nleukocyte migration occurs across venules. Several patterns of cell \nmigration can be distinguished, including\n\u2022 Movement of lymphocytes into secondary lymphoid tissues\n\u2022 Migration of activated lymphocytes to sites of inflammation\n\u2022 Migration of neutrophils into tissues during an acute immune \nresponse and migration of mononuclear cells into sites of \nchronic inflammation\nEach pattern of migration is determined by particular sets of che -\nmokines and adhesion molecules. There are three stages in the \nadhesion that precedes migration across the endothelium:\n1. Slowing and rolling: Most leukocyte migration occurs across \nvenules as the shear force acting on circulating cells is lower and \nadhesion molecules are selectively expressed in venules. Initial \nslowing is mediated principally by selectins (such as E-selectin) on \nthe endothelium, interacting with carbohydrate on the leukocytes.\n2. Triggering: Leukocytes that have been slowed may be triggered \nby chemokines released in the tissue or synthesized by the \nendothelium and bound to the endothelial cell surface. The che -\nmokine signal is integrated over time, allowing cells to receive \na sufficient signal to initiate migration. Triggering activates the \nintegrins required for firm attachment to the endothelium.\n3. Adhesion: The affinity of leukocyte integrins (such as LFA-1) on \nactivated cells is increased, which allows them to bind to cell \nadhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1) induced on the endothe -\nlium by inflammatory cytokines. The integrins and CAMs are \nattached to the cytoskeleton of each cell, which allows the leu -\nkocyte to pull itself across the endothelium.

For example, \u03b1 chemokines bind to \nCXCR1, CXCR2, etc. Most chemokines bind to several different chemokine receptors, and most receptors recognize several dif -\nferent chemokines. In addition, cells generally express several chemokine receptors so they can respond to a range of chemo -\nkines. Most cells of the body express some chemokine receptors at stages during their development, which control their position in the developing organism. Leukocytes change their receptors according to their state of differentiation and activation, which allows them to respond to inflammatory signals or position themselves in lymphoid tissues. For example, CCR7 is present on T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and B cells. The chemokines that bind this receptor (CCL19 and CCL21) are produced in the T-cell areas of lymph nodes. Consequently T cells and DCs are attracted to these areas when they enter a lymph node. B cells can also be attracted to the T-cell areas when they express CCR7 after antigen stimulation.

Molecules of \nthe classical pathway are designated C1, C2, etc. Alternative-\npathway molecules have letter designations, for example factor B \n(FB or just \u201cB\u201d). The properties of the components are given over -\nleaf, and their receptors on p. 78. The complement components \ninteract with each other so that the products of one reaction form \nthe enzyme for the next. Thus, a small initial stimulus can trigger \na cascade of activity.

We can distinguish between mutations that clearly \nprevent the function of a particular component of the immune sys -\ntem and variants (polymorphisms) that affect the quality of an immune \nresponse. Polymorphisms are often stable in a population and many \nindividuals have the variants, whereas mutations are deleterious and \nare usually lost over evolutionary timescales. The MHC is the most \npolymorphic of all gene loci, and variant MHC molecules differ in their \nability to present antigen, leading to variations in immune response \nand disease susceptibility ( Fig. 3.44 ). Polymorphism within the MHC \nis thought to reflect selection for variants that protect against particu -\nlar infections, either extant pathogens or those that have occurred in \nhistoric times. One might therefore expect particular MHC variants to \nbe associated with resistance to infectious disease. In practice there \nare many more reports of MHC haplotypes that are associated with \nsusceptibility to infection or autoimmunity. This bias is seen because \nit is easier to identify positive disease associations. Importantly, the \nrelative risk associated with individual MHC variants depends on the \npopulation under investigation and the disease pattern. Susceptibility \nmay be modified by other genes in the population, and in some cases \nthe strain of pathogen can also affect whether an MHC gene is pro -\ntective. Other polymorphisms affect the ability to respond to a wide \nrange of antigens.

Figure 4.5  lists some of the conditions that \nshow particularly strong MHC disease associations. It is important \nto understand that the haplotypes associated with a disease are \nspecific for particular populations, and that a variant that confers \nsusceptibility in one population may not do so in another; even if it \ndoes, the relative risk value will probably be different.\nShared epitope hypothesis  can be used to explain the asso -\nciation of a disease with several different MHC haplotypes at the \nsame locus, because they have a structural similarity. For example, \nDRB1*0401, *0404, *0405, and *0408 all share an epitope and are \nassociated with increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis.\nRelative risk (RR)  is the risk of developing a disease when a par -\nticular HLA haplotype is present, compared with when it is absent. \nA relative risk >1 indicates that the haplotype is more prevalent in \npatients than the general population, whereas a relative risk <1 \nindicates that the variant may be protective. Note that RR is not \nthe same as the \u201codds ratio,\u201d which is a different measure of the \nstrength of association of two variables.\nLinkage  occurs between sets of genes on a single chromosome, \nsuch as the HLA complex. Unless crossover occurs between \nmaternal and paternal chromosomes, a linked gene complex will \nbe inherited as a block.\nLinkage disequilibrium  is the finding that some pairs of genes are \nfound together more frequently than would be expected by chance, \nthat is, more than the product of their gene frequencies. There are \ntwo possible explanations: (1) there is a selective advantage in \ninheriting the entire block of genes, or (2) two genes have appeared \ntogether by chance and there has been insufficient evolutionary time \nto separate them. Many sets of MHC molecules are linked, for exam -\nple, HLA-A1 with HLA-B8, and HLA-A3 with HLA-B7. Consequently \nif one MHC molecule is associated with a disease, any linked haplo -\ntypes will also be associated with that disease, although they do not \nnecessarily contribute to the disease susceptibility.\nExtended haplotype  refers to a set of linked genes, inherited as \na block, for example, HLA-DRB5*0101-DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-\nDQB1*0602 is referred to as the haplotype DR2."

For example, the variant \nHLA-DRB1*0406 describes a variant of the HLA-DR gene at the \nB1 locus, which encodes the first of the DR- \u03b2 chains. The variant \nproduces molecules with serological specificity \u201c04\u201d and is the 06th \ngenetic variant that produces this specificity. Additional figures can \nindicate expression (promoter) variants of the gene.\nTissue typing  is the technique used to determine the MHC speci -\nficities carried by an individual. Originally typing was performed \nby adding antiserum of a defined specificity (such as anti-HLA-\nDR4) to the cell to be typed (usually lymphocytes). If the cells \nexpress the antigen, the addition of complement kills them, which \ncan be detected by trypan blue staining. More recently laborato -\nries use sequence-specific primers or sequence-specific probes \nin PCR reactions to determine the genotype. A related method \nuses gel electrophoresis in the presence of reference DNA \nstrands, where each reference strand can identify one variant but \nthis method is limited by the large number of HLA variants that \nmight occur.

If antigenic deter -\nminants are expressed on more than one MHC haplotype, it is a \npublic specificity. Epitopes expressed on only one haplotype are \nprivate specificities.\nMixed lymphocyte culture/reaction (MLC/MLR)  is a technique \nfor typing cells, in which lymphocytes of different individuals are co-\ncultured. If the cells differ, they are stimulated to divide. The test can \nbe done either with each set of cells reacting to the other (two-way \nMLR) or with one set (stimulator) treated so it cannot respond and \nonly the proliferation of the responding (test) cells being measured \n(one-way MLR). A lack of response indicates that the test cell and \nthe typing cell share an MHC specificity. This test is now used for \nresearch purposes rather than routine tissue typing.\nPrimed lymphocyte typing test (PLT)  is a highly sensitive MLC \nassay for detecting determinants that stimulate allogeneic T cells. \nThe test cells are mixed with lymphocytes previously primed to a \nparticular determinant by co-culture with homozygous typing cells. \nIn a subsequent co-culture the primed cells proliferate rapidly if \nthey encounter the priming MHC specificity again."

For diseases such \nas type-1 diabetes, up to 50% of disease susceptibility is due \nto genotype, as determined by concordance rates in identical \ntwins. The major contributing locus is the MHC (see p. 119) \nand susceptibility may relate to single genes (e.g., HLA-B27 in \nankylosing spondylitis) or sets of genes which share a common \nspecificity. Another important gene is protein tyrosine phospha -\ntase PTPN22 associated with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 \ndiabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis. This and other genes that \ncontrol lymphocyte activation (CTLA-4) contribute to several \nautoimmune diseases. Deficiency of autoimmunity regulator \n(AIRE) in the thymus results in defects in central tolerance and \nautoimmune polyglandular syndrome affecting, thyroid, para -\nthyroid, adrenal, and pancreatic islets (see Fig. 4.6 ). Defects in \nthe target organ and genes controlling the differentiation and \nfunction of the cells in that tissue contribute to tissue-specific \nautoimmune conditions.\nAutoimmune activation.

Most self-reactive T cells are deleted or anergized, \nbut autoreactive B cells may become activated by a mechanism that \nbypasses tolerant T cells. For example, a cross-reactive exogenous \nantigen taken up by an autoreactive B cell could be presented to \na T cell recognizing a nonself epitope, which then helps the B cell \n(Fig. 4.7a ). Alternatively, polyclonal activators such as Epstein Barr \nvirus (EBV) could stimulate B cells directly.\nT-cell autoreactivity  may also be induced by cross-reacting  \nmicrobial antigens.

Before transgenic mice were developed, animal \nmodels of disease were identified either by noting strains that had \na phenotype resembling the disease or by identifying sporadic \nmutants and inbreeding them to fix the mutation in the offspring. \nIn general, transgenic mice have been most useful for model -\ning single-gene immunodeficiencies, such as SCID. In contrast, \nstrains have more often been used to model polygenic conditions, \nsuch as autoimmune conditions; susceptibility to autoimmune \ndisease depends on many gene loci that interact with each other \nand environmental factors. Because of the complexity of such \ntraits, it must be emphasized that the model may only resemble \nthe human condition in its appearance. Figure 4.8  lists some of \nthe more important model strains.\nInbred strains  of animals are made by repeated brother-sister \nmatings in successive generations, to give a strain with identical \nsets of autosomes. If by chance a pair of identical chromosomes \noccurs in the F1 animals, inbreeding ensures that the pair remains \nfixed in the genome of subsequent generations. By repeated \ninbreeding, all of the chromosome pairs eventually become, and \nwill remain, homozygous.\nRecombinant strains  are produced by crossing different inbred \nstrains.

This gives \nstrains that have identical sets of chromosomes, but each set \nwill be of either the a-type or the b-type at random. They can \nbe used to determine which chromosomes carry the genes for \neach trait.\nCongenic strains  are bred to be identical to each other except at \nsome chosen locus.

After several hours a late-phase \nreaction develops, caused primarily by leukotrienes and che -\nmokines ( Fig. 4.10 ). Inflammatory cells including macrophages, \nbasophils, and other polymorphs are attracted to the site. \nEosinophil granule proteins are highly toxic for airway epithe -\nlium. Analogous immediate and late reactions occur in allergic \nskin reactions.\nAnaphylaxis  is a systemic type I reaction seen in sensitized animals \ninjected with allergen. The release of vasoactive amines and spas -\nmogens causes smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular \npermeability, and a fall in blood pressure. Respiratory or circulatory \nfailure may ensue. Anaphylactic reactions may occur in humans, for \nexample caused by bee venom or an adverse reaction to a vaccine \ncomponent in a sensitive individual.\nDesensitization  is a treatment aimed at reducing levels of allergen-\nspecific IgE by giving graded doses of the allergen over several \nmonths. The protocol deviates the immune response away from the \nTh2 type and induces higher levels of IgG.\nPrick test  is used to determine an individual\u2019s (type I) sensitivity \nto allergens, which are pricked onto the skin.

One of the reactants is immobilized on a chip coated with a film of gold, and the potential ligands are passed over it in the fluid phase while the chip is illuminated by polarized light. If ligands bind to the immobilized reactant, the optical properties of the chip are altered, thereby affecting the reflected light. Such instruments are useful for measuring the rate of association and dissociation of, for example, antibodies and antigens. They are also appropriate for detecting lower-affinity interactions between molecules, such as the binding of cell-adhesion molecules to integrins.\nElectrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA)  are techniques to \ndetect the association of two molecules, by running them (elec -\ntrophoresis) through a nondenaturing, polyacrylamide gel. Bound \nmolecules have different characteristics (size and/or charge) from unbound molecules and therefore their mobility will be shifted in the gel. The technique can be used to determine (for example) whether a transcription factor is associated with a DNA segment. If a complex of a transcription factor and a DNA probe is pres -\nent, then the identity of the factor can be determined by adding antibody against it into the mixture (Fig. 5.8). In this example, free probe (lane 1) moves fastest; probe bound to a nuclear protein (lane 2) is shifted. Addition of antibody against transcription factor \n(TF) A (lane 3) supershifts the band, indicating that the protein \nbound to the DNA probe is transcription factor A.

They are often made from hybridomas, which are prepared by fusing lymphocytes (for example, splenocytes) from an immunized mouse or rat, with a nonsecretor myeloma cell line using PEG ( Fig. 5.11). The fusion mixture is plated out in a \nselection medium such as HAT. HAT contains hypoxanthine, ami -\nnopterin, and thymidine. Aminopterin blocks a metabolic pathway that can be bypassed if hypoxanthine and thymidine are present, but the myeloma lacks this bypass and consequently dies in HAT medium. Lymphocytes die naturally in culture after 1\u20132 weeks, but fused cells survive because they have the immortality of the myeloma and the metabolic bypass of the lymphocytes. Some of the fused cells secrete antibody, and supernatants are tested in a specific assay. Wells that produce the desired antibody are then cloned. Human B cells can be immortalized by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus. By comparison with polyclonal antisera, mono -\nclonal antibodies are well defined, but not always more specific or of higher affinity.\nCloning is a process in which a cell population is successively \ndiluted and set up in culture so that there are wells containing only one cell. The progeny of this cell are grown as a clone. Alternatively, the cultures may be grown in soft agar to prevent them spreading, and colonies are isolated by micromanipulation.\nT-cell lines are produced by culturing a population of primed T cells \nin the presence of antigen and IL-2, which promotes proliferation of antigen-specific cells. The antigen must be presented to the T cells by APCs, usually macrophages or thymocytes, that have been treated to block their metabolism. The phenotype of the T cells can be modulated during production by the addition of other cytokines. For example, expanding T cells in the presence of IL-4 and corti -\ncosteroids favors the generation of T\nh2 cells, whereas the standard \nprotocol favors T h1 cells. The production of antigen-specific T cells \nis measured by proliferation.\nProliferation of lymphocytes is usually measured by their uptake of \nradiolabeled metabolites required for DNA or RNA synthesis, such as \n125I-uridine deoxyribose or 3H-thymidine. The uptake of these \nmetabolites is measured by harvesting the cells on a cell harvester and counting the incorporated radioactivity.\nPeptide:MHC complexes are used to identify clones of T cells that \nrecognize a particular antigenic peptide. The complex consists of biotinylated MHC molecules (bound as tetramers to avidin) with the appropriate antigenic peptide. These MHC:antigen polymers have high avidity for the TCR and stimulate T cells very effectively."
