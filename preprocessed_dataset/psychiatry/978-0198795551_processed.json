For doctors of our generation, that sense of panic was\neased somewhat by the reassuring presence in the white coat\npocket of the original Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine . A quick\nglance at one of its pages before approaching the patient served to\nrefresh factual knowledge, guide initial assessment, and highlight\n\u2018not to be missed\u2019 areas, allowing one to enter the room with a sense\nof at least initial confidence which would otherwise have been\nlacking.\nThe initial months of psychia tric practice are a time of particular\nanxiety , when familiar medica l knowledge seems of no use and the\npatients and their symptoms appear baffling and strange. Every new\npsychiatrist is familiar with the strange sense of relief when a\n\u2018medical\u2019 problem arises in one of their patients\u2014\u2018finally something I\nknow about\u2019. At this time, for us, the absence of a similar  volume to\nthe Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine  for psychiatrists was\nkeenly felt. This volume attempts to fulfil the same function for\nmedical students and doctors beginning psychiatric training or\npractice. The white coat pocket will have gone, but we hope that it\ncan provide that same portable reassurance.\n2004\nD.M.S.\nR.S.S.\nJ.K.B.\nR.D.\nA.M.M."

Nonetheless, during the process of creating the first\nedition of this handbook, we found ourselves understanding why the\ncomparison is often made\u2014experiencing the trials of a prolonged\ngestation and a difficult delivery, balanced by the pride of seeing\none\u2019s offspring \u2018out in the world\u2019.

Once the rest of the book is finished, composing the\npreface can allow the autho rs an opportunity for reflection and an\nattempt at summing up their initial aims and current hopes for the\nbook as it leaves their hands for the final time.\nWhile writing this third preface we found it interesting to examine\nits two predece ssors, to see what they revealed about our thoughts\nat those times. Reading the first preface it\u2019s clear we were writing to\nourselves, or at least to our slightly younger selves, reflecting on the\nbook we wished we\u2019d had during our psychiatric training. The\nemotions conveyed are those of anxiety and hope. Moving on to the\nsecond, it is addressed to our junior colleagues and seem s to us to\nconvey a mixture of indignation and pride.\nIn this third edition we have continued to revise and update the\nbook\u2019 s contents in line with new developments in clinical practice.\nWhile these changes reflect ongoing and incremental improvement,\none cannot fail to be struck by how unsatisfactory the state of our\nknowledge is in many areas and how inadequate many of our\ncurrent treatments are. On this occasion we finished the book with\nthe hopes that it would continue to serve as a useful guide  to current\nbest practice and an aid in the management of individual patients,\nand that these current inadequacies would inspire, rather than\ndiscourage, the next generation of clinicians and researchers.

DSM -5 did finally arrive in 2013 (\n DSM-5 and all that \u2026,\np. 12), but unfortunately , although ICD-1 1 has been \u2018launched\u2019 in\nJune 2018, it is unlikely to be fully ratified until 2019 and\nimplementation will not be before 2022 (\n Wait, what \u2026 ICD-1 1? p.\n1120). We have tried to integrate DSM-5, while keeping one eye on\nthe current proposals for ICD-1 1 and still retaining ICD-10 categories\nand codes as far as possible (as it is likely that we will all still be\nusing these for the foreseeab le future). Hopefully you will agree that\nwe have struck a pragmatic balance between being useful and yet\ninformative. Full assimilation of ICD-1 1 will have to wait until the fifth\nedition!\nNevertheless, we have unde rtaken a major revision of the overall\ntext, and the scope of these  changes has meant a reorientation of\nthe content to reflect the evolution of ideas that directly and indirectly\nhave influenced psychiatric thinking over those last few years such\nas global mental health and gender-related issues. Equally ,\nadvances in research have increased our understanding of the\nbiological basis of mental disorder , hence our inclusion of a new\nneuropsychiatry section (and a lengthy explanation  of what\nneuropsychiatry actually is; \n pp. 122\u2013125).\nWhen we first approached this project, over 15 years ago, we tried\nto produce the book we wished we had when starting training. Our\ncore aim was to provide a practical guide for anyone entering this\nmedical specialty , which would help them to gain a working\nknowledge of the diagnosis and management of mental disorders\nand a deeper understanding of the functioning of the brain in health\nand disease. While that experience will always be daunting and\nsometimes overwhelming, perhaps this fourth incarnation of the\nhandbook can still act as a companion in the early days and a"

As a\ntrainee psychia trist, you will have to cope with questions like \u2018are you\na real doctor?\u2019  In addition, the general public (and sometimes other\nmedical profe ssionals) frequently misunderstand the types and\nseverity of illnesses that you deal with. Either they picture you\nspending all of your time tending to Woody Allen-like self-obsessed,\nbefuddled neurotics or guarding Hannibal Lecter-like murdering\npsychopaths. The reality is that psychiatrists deal with the most\ncommon human disorders which cause the greatest  morbidity\nworldwide.\nPsychiatry considers all aspects of human experience over the\nwhole of the lifespan: elation, grief, anxieties, flights  of fancy ,\nconfusion, despair , perception and misperception, and memory and\nits loss. We see the mother with a healthy baby , perplexed and\nfrightened by her tearfulness  and inability to cope, and terrified by\nher thoughts of harming her child. We see the family of a young man\nwho have watched him become a stranger , muttering wild\naccusations about conspiracies, and we aim to be the doctors who\nknow what best to do in these circumstances. The specialty of\npsychiatry is (or should be) the most \u2018human\u2019 specialty\u2014devoted to\nthe understand ing of the whole person in health and illnes s. Indeed,\nit is the only medical specialty without a veterinary counterpart.\nIt is certainly true that the level of knowledge about causation and\ntreatment of mental disorders is less advanced than for other\nbranches of medicine. In some ways, however , this is an attraction.\nIn other specialties, much of what was formerly mysterious is now\nunderstood, and interventions and diagnostic methods once fantastic\nare now quotidian. Psychiat ry offers a final frontier of diagnostic\nuncertainty and an undiscovered country of aetiology to explore.\nPerhaps the lack of progress made in psychiatry , compared with the\nother specialties, is not because of lack of will or intelligence of the\npractitioners, but due to the inherent toughness of the problems.

Psychiatrists have been involved\nin huma n rights abuses in states around the world when definitions\nof mental illness were expanded to take in political insubordination.\nDisease, sickness, and illness behaviour\nThe distinction between disease (or disorder) and sickness should\nbe understood. Disease encompasses either a specific tissue lesion\nor a characteri stic constellation of symptoms. Sickness, on the other\nhand, encomp asses the suffering and functional deficit consequent\non symptoms. One may exist without the other , e.g. a patient with\nundiagnosed, asymptomatic breast cancer undoubtedly has disease\nbut is not sick; a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome may see\nthemselves (and be consid ered) as sick but does not have an\nidentifiable lesion.\nPatients gene rally present complaining of symptoms, and this\nprocess is called illness or illness behaviour .

This statement\nconceals an assumption that giving placebo (\u2018sugar pills\u2019) is the\nsame as no treatment at all. This could not be further from the truth,\nand in mild to moderate depression, placebo exerts a powerful\neffect. Nobody  is likely to run the headline \u2018Psychiatrists agree\nantidepressants should not be the first-line treatment for mild to\nmoderate depression\u2019. In fact, clear separation of antid epressant\nmedication benefit from placebo is only seen for moderately severe\ndepression, as defined by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (i.e.\nscores of 25+).9\nAnother telling illustration of the power of placebo in psychiatry is\nJohnstone et al.\u2019s10 ECT trial comparing sham-ECT (anaesthesia\nplus paralysis)  to active treatment. It is no surprise that placebo\ntreatment with sham-ECT was very effective, reducing  Hamilton\nDepression scores by around 50%. The real result was that ECT\nwas superior to sham-ECT , but only for psychotic  depression (i.e.\nclinically much more severe).\nShould we be surprised that placebos can exert such powerful\neffects? Research on pain11 (see Box 1.4) suggests that humans\nand other animals have neurobiological systems that evolved to\nutilize activatio n through cognitive mechanisms (e.g. expectation,\npreconditioning, and contextual-related assessment) that can induce\nphysiological change. (Imagine the physical effects of exam nerves.)\nThis certainly presents a challenge when designing randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCT s) and interpreting the efficacy of active\ntreatments, but it also offers the potential of invoking these resiliency\nmechanisms to effectively aid in recovery from injury , infection,\ndistress, and functional impairment.\nThe potency of such techniques has been well known to\npractitioners of traditional medicine for millennia. This is not to\nsuggest we should pipe in soothing music, don Mesmeresque purple\nrobes, and mutter incantatio ns in Latin. Rather , we ought to be\ncircumspect in how we interpret and present the evidence for the\ntreatments we recommend to our patients. We also ought to be\naware that our attitude towards the patient and the setting in which\nthey are seen will af fect the real benefits of any intervention."

Stigma can become self-\nreinforcing, as it can be assoc iated with avoidance of the stigmatized\nindividuals, leaving no opportunity for society to confront and change\nits beliefs.\nFear of the unknown, fear of contamination, and fear of death or\nthe sight of death have led to diseases of all kinds being stigmatized\nthroughout history . This is particularly true of infectious diseases,\ndiseases caus ing disfigureme nt, and mental disorders. As infectious\nand disfiguring diseases have become both more treatable and\nbetter understood, sufferers from mental disorders have remained\nuniquely vulnerable to stigmatization.\nOne marker of this has been the ease with which originally neutral,\ndescriptive terms for mental disorders have taken on a pejorative\nand disparaging meaning: cretin, maniac, spastic, imbecile. All have\nbeen abandoned in an attempt to free affected individuals from the\napprobation the name had acquired.

            "Text": "Anti-psychiatry\nOne view of medicine is that it is an applied science whos e object of\nscientific curiosity is the understanding of the causes and processes\nof human illness and the study of methods of preventing or\nameliorating them. In the scientific method, there are no absolute\ntruths, only theories which fit the observed facts as they are currently\nknown. All scientists must be open to the challenging of firmly\nestablished theories as new observations are made and new\nexperiments reported.\nAll psychiatrists should retain this healthy scientific scepticism and\nbe prepared to question their beliefs about the causes and cures of\nmental illness. Developments (and hence improvements  in patient\ncare) come from improveme nt in observation methods and trials of\nnew treatment modalities. A result of this may be the enforced\nabandonment of cherished beliefs and favoured treatments. Always\nremember that insulin coma therapy14 was, at one time, believed to\nbe an ef fective treatment for psychotic illnesses.\nWhile rigorous examination of the basic and clinical sciences of\npsychiatry is essential if the specialty is to progress, psychiatry as a\nmedical specia lty has, over the last 50yrs, been subject to a more\nfundamental criticism\u2014that the empirical approach and the medical\nmodel are unsuited to the understanding of mental disord er and that\nthey cause harm to the individuals they purport to treat. This basic\nbelief, known as \u2018anti-psychia try\u2019, has been expressed by a variety of\nindividuals over the years, reaching a peak in the late 1960s.\nAlthough the central arguments of the anti-psychiatry movement\nhave largely been discredited in the mainstream scientific literature,\nthey have retained currency  in some areas of the popular press,\nwithin some patient organizations, and in certain religious cults. They\nare presented here for histo ric interest and so that the sources for\nmodern-day advocates of these ideas can be identified (see Box\n1.6).\nCentral anti-psychiatry beliefs\n\u2022The mind is not a bodily organ and so cannot be diseased.\n\u2022The scientific method canno t explain the subjective abnormalities\nof mental disorder , as no direct observation can take place."

We lack knowledge\nof the aetiology and pathoge nesis of most psychiatric disorders; we\nhave no objective diagnostic or prognostic investigations; and our\ndrug and psychological treatments are often minimally or only\npartially effective.

The move to community care which followed\nEnoch Powell\u2019 s \u2018Water Tower Speech\u2019 in 1961 was driven by the\nhope that many of the deficit s experienced by sufferers from mental\ndisorder were not intrinsic to the disorders themselves but were\nrelated to institutional living .

            "Text": "The clinical interview\nIn most branches of clinical medicine, diagnoses are made largely\non the basis of the patient\u2019 s history , with physical examination and\ninvestigation playing important, but subordinate, roles. In psychiatry ,\nphysical examination and investigations are of lesser diagnostic\nvalue and diagnosis is based on the clinical interview and, to a lesser\nextent, the later course of the patient\u2019 s illness. Clinical interviewing is\nthus the central skill of the psychiatrist, and development of clinical\ninterviewing skills is the main aim of basic psychiatric training.\nThe clinical interview includes both history-taking and mental state\nexamination (MSE). The MSE is a systematic record of the patient\u2019 s\ncurrent psychopathology . In addition to its role in diagnosis, the\nclinical interview begins the development of a therapeutic\nrelationship and is, in many cases, the beginning of treatment.\nClinical intervi ew skills cannot be learnt from a textbo ok. This\nchapter is intended as a guide to the doctor developin g skills in\ninterviewing psychiatric patients. As a trainee psychiatrist, you\nshould also take the opportunity to observe experienced clinicians,\nas they interview patients, to review your own videotaped\nconsultations with a tutor, and, most importantly , to carry out many\nclinical intervie ws and present the results to your seniors. Skills in\nthis area, as with all others, come with experience and practice.\nThis chapter describes a model for the assessment of general\nadult and old age psychiatry patients on the wards or in the\noutpatient clinic. For specia l patient populations, modif ications or\nextensions to the standard interview are described in the appropriate\nchapter: alcohol and drug problems (\n Assessment of the patient\nwith alcohol problems , p. 584; \n Assessment of the drug user, p.\n630); forensic (\n Assessing risk of violence , p. 748; \n Suggested\nformat for criminal court report , p. 770); child and adolescent (\nAssessment 1: principles , p. 648; \n Assessment 2: considerations ,\np. 650; \n Assessment 3: practice points , p. 652); intellectual\ndisability (\n The process of assessment , p. 798); and\npsychotherapy (\n  Assessment for psychotherapy , p. 884).\nThe student or doctor comin g to psychiatric interviewing for the\nfirst time is likely to be apprehensive.

Remember that the interviewer is not like a\nlawyer or policeman trying to \u2018get at the truth\u2019, but rather an aid to the\npatient telling the story in their own words. Start by listening,\nprompting only when necessary , and aim to feel at the end of the\ninterview that you really unde rstand the patient\u2019 s problems and their\nperception of them.\nThe following pages describe the standard structure for a routine\nhistory , MSE, and case summary; there are then pages devoted to\nthe different symptom areas in adult psychiatry , with suggested\nprobe questions. These are intended as guides to the sort of\nquestions to ask the patient (or to ask yourself about the patient) and\nmay be rephrased in your own words. See Box 2.1 for advice on\npersonal safety .\nBox 2.1 Always consider your personal safety when\ninterviewing\nThere is a risk of aggression or violence in only a small minority of\npsychiatric patients. In the vast majority of patients, the only risk of\nviolence is towards themselv es. However , the fact that violence is\nrare can lead to doctors putting themselves at risk due to\nthoughtlessness. To combat this, it is important to think about the\nrisk of violence before every consultation with a new patient or\nwith a familiar patient with new symptoms.\nBefore interviewing a patient, particularly for the first time,\nconsider: who you are interviewing, where you are interviewing,\nand with whom. Ensure that the nursing staf f have this information.\n\u2022If possible, review the patient\u2019 s records, noting previous\nsymptomatology and episodes of previous violence (the best\npredictor of future violence).\n\u2022A numb er of factors will increase the risk of violence, including: a\nprevious history of violence,  psychotic illness, intoxicatio n with\nalcohol or drugs, frustration , feeling of threat (which may be\ndelusional or relate to real-world concerns)."

Introduce yourself and any accompanying staff members by\nname and status. Ensure that you know the names and relationships\nof any people accompanying  the patient (and ask the patient if they\nwish these persons to be present during the interview).

Even in situations where the patient\nappears to speak some English, sufficient for day-to-day\nconversation, an interpreter is still highly desirable because idiomatic\nlanguage and culturally specific interpretations of psychological\nphenomena may confuse understanding. Where possible, the\ninterpreter should share not only a language, but also a cultural\nbackground with the patient, as many descriptions of psychiatric\nsymptoms are culture-specif ic.

As a junior trainee, you may have\nto break at the end of the history-taking segment, in order  to present\nthe case to your senior and get advice on management.\nAfter the interview\nThe process of assessment does not, of course, end with the initial\nclinical interview . In psychiatry , all diagnoses are, to some extent,\nprovisional. You should follow your initial interview by gathering\ninformation from relatives, the general practitioner (GP), and\nprevious case records and clarifying symptoms observed by nursing\nstaff. In an emergency situation, a modification of this technique,\nfocusing mainl y on the acute problem, is more appropriate, with re-\ninterviewing later to fill in the blanks, if required.\nDiscussing management\nIn psychiatry , more than any other specialty , it is essential for\nsuccessful management that the patient has a good understanding\nof their disorder and its treatment. There is no equivalent in\npsychiatry of the simple fracture where all that is required of the\npatient is to \u2018lie back and take the medicine\u2019. The treatment of any\npsychiatric disorder begins at the initial interview where, in addition\nto the assessm ent, the doctor should aim to establish a therapeutic\nalliance, effectively commun icate the management plan, instil a\nsense of hope in the patient, and encourage self-help strategies.\nEstablish a therapeutic relationship\n\u2022Aim to listen more than you speak (especially initially).\n\u2022Show respect for the patient  as an individual (e.g. estab lish their\npreferred mode  of address; ask permission for anyone else to be\npresent at the interview).\n\u2022Explicitly make your actions for the benefit of the patient.\n\u2022Do not argue; agree to disagree if consensus cannot be reached.\n\u2022Accept that, in some patients, trust may take time to develop."

One suggested method involves asking\nabout behaviours and thoughts associated with increasing suicide\nrisk. This tactfu l enquiry can be made, in addition to an estimate of\nrisk.

They\nare very rarely seen in psychotic illness alone but are reported in\nassociation with dementias, cortical tumours, and stimulant and\nhallucinogen ingestion, and, most commonly , in delirium tremens.\nThe visual hallucinations seen in delirium tremens are\ncharacteristically \u2018Lilliputian hallucinations\u2019 of miniature animals or\npeople.\nOlfactory and gustatory hallucinations may be difficult to\ndistinguish and occur in a wide range of mental disorders . Olfactory\nhallucinations occur in epileptic auras, in depressive illnesses (where\nthe smell is described as unpleasant or repulsive to others), and in\nschizophrenia. They may also occur in association with a persistent\ndelusion of malodorousness.\nHypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations are transient false\nperceptions which occur on falling asleep (hypnagogic) or on waking\n(hypnopompic). They may have the characteristics of true or pseudo-\nhallucinations and are most commonly visual or auditory . While they\nare sometimes seen in narcolepsy and affective illnesses, they are\nnot indicative of ill health and are frequently reported by healthy\npeople.\nElemental hallucinations are the hallucinatory experience of simple\nsensory elements such as flashes of light or unstructured noises.\nThey are associated with organic states.\nExtracampine hallucinations are those false perceptions where the\nhallucination is of an external object beyond the normal range of\nperception of the sensory organs.\nFunctional hallucinations are hallucinations of any moda lity that\nare experienced simultaneously with a normal stimulus in that\nmodality (e.g. a patient who only experiences auditory hallucinations\nwhen he hears the sound of the ward\u2019 s air conditioning)."

Clinical assessment of IQ is by consideration of\nthe highest level of educational achievement reached and by\nassessment of the patient\u2019 s comprehension, vocabulary , and level of\nunderstanding in the course of the clinical interview . To some extent,\nthis technique relies upon experience, giving the doctor a suitable\ncohort of previous patients for comparison, and allowance should be\nmade for apparent impairm ent that may be secondary to other\nabnormalities of the mental state.

In psychiatry , the terms\nsymptom and sign tend to be used synonymously because\nabnormalities of mental state can only be elicited by exploring, with\nthe patient, their internal experiences.\nPsychopathology  is the study of abnormalities  in mental state and\nis one of the core sciences in clinical psychiatry . Descriptive\npsychopathology  is one method for describing the subjective\nexperience and behaviour of patients and is the basis for our current\nclinical descrip tions of mental disorder . It is atheoretical and does not\nrest on any particular explanation for the cause of the abnormal\nmental state.  In this, it contrasts with dynamic (Freudian)\npsychopathology , which attempts to describe, and then to explain,\nthese states.\nDescriptive psychopathology includes close observation of the\npatient\u2019 s behaviour and empathic exploration of their subjective\nexperience. The latter is called phenomenology . The following\ngeneral terms are used as qualifiers for symptoms described in the\nfollowing pages:\n\u2022Subjective vs objective \u2014objective signs are those noted by an\nexternal observer; subjective signs are those reported by the\npatient."

Here, the\ncontent  of the symptom is the belief  about the name and methods\nof the persecutor; the form is that of a persecutory delusion.\nContent  is culture- and experienc e-related, whereas form is\nattributable to the type of underlying mental illness.\n\u2022Primary vs secondary \u2014primary symptoms are considered as\narising directly from the pathology of the mental illness; secondary\nsymptoms arise as an understandable response to some aspect of\nthe disordered mental state (e.g. a patient with severe depression\ndeveloping a secondary delusion  of being wicked and deserving\npunishment). Secondary symptoms can be understood in the light\nof knowledge of the patient\u2019 s symptoms; primary symptom s can be\nempathized with, but not fully understood.\n\u2022Endogenous vs reactive \u2014these terms have been largely made\nredundant by developments in understanding of mental disorders\nbut are still seen occasionally . It was formerly thought that some\nconditions arose in response to external events (e.g. depression\narising after job loss) (reactive ), while others arose spontaneously\nfrom within ( endogenous ).\n\u2022Psychotic vs neurotic \u2014in present classifications, these terms are\nused purely descriptively to describe two common types of\nsymptoms that may occur in a variety of mental disorders.\nPreviously , they were used to distinguish those disorders\ncharacterized by impairment of insight, abnormal beliefs, and\nabnormal perceptual experiences from those where there was\npreserved insight but abnormal af fect.\n\u2022Congruent vs incongruent \u2014this is an observation made regarding\nthe apparent appropriateness of a patient\u2019 s affect towards their\nsymptoms or their symptoms to their mood. A patient with apparent\ncheerfulness despite persec utory beliefs is described as having\nincongruent  affect; a patient with profoundly depressed mood\ndeveloping a delusion that they were mortally ill is described as\npossessing a mood-congruent  delusion."

In\nthe early 1900 s, neuropsych iatry was an emerging discipline in the\nGerman- and French-speaking world, and to an extent in the USA.\nAll was to change when the rise of psychodynamic thinking led\nmany psychiatrists to embra ce a new \u2018mentalistic\u2019 approach, and a\nseparation from neurology began. There was resistance. Notably , Sir\nCharles Symonds (1890\u20131978), the doyen of British neurologists,\nfought to prevent psychiatry\u2019 s drift away from neurology and\nneuroscience.5 However , after World War II, the division between\nneurology and psychiatry widened, symbolized by The Archives of\nNeurology and Psychiatry  (first published in 1919) separating into\ntwo journals. In many countries, separate departments of neurology\nand psychiatry were formed, with separate training programmes.\nHowever , from the mid-twentieth century onwards, developments\nin neuropsychopharmacology led to the emergence of what has\nbeen called the \u2018second biological psychiatry\u2019.

By\nthe 1980s, even the nosology of psychiatry was changing, with the\npublication of ICD-9 (1978) and DSM-III (1980), when the neuroses\nwere rejected in favour of a biological medical model . With the\ndevelopment of functional imaging techniques, including CT, MRI,\nand PET/SPECT , and rapid advances in molecular genetics,\nresearch of neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and cognitive\nneuroscientists increasingly overlapped.

The origins of this approa ch arise in\nresearch and early localiza tion theories of Franz Gall (1758 \u2013\n1828),11 followe d in the mid-nineteen th century by neuroanatomic al\nlesion studies in aphasias by Paul Broca (1824\u20131880)  and Carl\nWernicke (1848\u20131905). Research in this area peaked in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with work extending into\nthe clinical descriptions of dementias by Alzheimer and Arnold Pick\n(1851\u20131924). It was not until 1972 that the \u2018father of behavioural\nneurology\u2019 Norman Geschwind (1926\u20131984) coined the name at a\nmeeting of the American Academy of Neurology , and in 1982, the\nBehavioural Neurology Society was founded (now the Society for\nBehaviour and Cognitive Neurology).12 In the USA, Geschwind and\ncolleagues were responsib le for a renaissance of behavioural\nneuroscience, not only because of their work on disconnection\nsyndromes, aphasia, and behavioural syndromes of limbic epilepsy\n(the eponymous Geschwind syndrome), but also the legacy of\ntraining generations of behavioural neurologists (including such\nluminaries as Kenneth Heilman13 and Antonio Damasio14). With the\nadvent of in vivo neuroimaging from the 1980s onwards, the\ncognitive neurosciences have capitalized on having new tools to\nexplore lesion, structural, and functional correlations with\nbehavioural dysfunction in living people.\nThe interwoven history of neuropsychiatry is outlined briefly on \npp. 122\u2013123. It is worth noting that histo rically neuropsychiatry is a\ndistinct discipli ne from biological psychiatry , which emer ged along\nwith biological treatments of psychiatric disorders in the late 1930s to\nearly 1950s.

            "Text": "biological psychiatry The Engrammes of Psychiatry  in 1947.\nBiological psychiatry developed to encompass the expan ding fields\nof brain biochemistry , neuroendocrinology , cellular and molecular\nmedicine, and genetics, as they applied to mental disorders. Due to\nthe cross-fertili zation of the neurosciences over the last 70 years, it\nhas become increasingly difficult to distinguish biological  psychiatry\nfrom other clinical and academic neurosciences. Indeed the term is\nsometimes used in a pejorative way to suggest overly reductive\nthinking. The same allegations have been levelled at\nneuropsychiatry . Developme nts in our understandin g of the\ninteraction between genes and the environment, together with the\nrise of biological psychology , neuropsychology , and more recently\ncognitive neuropsychiatry ,15 also mean that if we are ever to have a\nmore complete understanding of how the brain function s in health\nand disease, then further integration is vital. In clinical practice,\nignoring psychological and social aspects is at best inconsiderate\nand at worst negligent.\nThe current practice of both neuropsychiatry and behavioural\nneurology is focused on better understanding the links between\nneuroscience and behaviour , with an emphasis on the care of\nindividuals with neurologically based behavioural disturbances.\nWhether trained primarily in psychiatry , neurology , or both,\npractitioners require specific experience in the evaluation,  differential\ndiagnosis, prognosis, pharmacological treatment, psychosocial\nmanagement, and neurorehabilitation of persons with complex\nneuropsychiatric and neurobehavioural conditions.\nPsychiatric presentations of organic illness\nAll psychiatric illnesses are, by their nature, organic, i.e. they involve\nabnormalities of normal brain structure or function. The term \u2018organic\nillness\u2019 in modern psychiatric classification, however , refers to those\nconditions with demonstrable aetiology in central nervous system\n(CNS) pathology . Organic disorders related to substance misuse are\ndealt with in \n  Chapter 14. This chapter deals with those disorders\nthat are caused by degenerative, traumatic, inflammatory , infective,\nautoimmune, and metabolic conditions."

Epilepsy is a disease of the brain, characterized\nby an enduring predisposition to epileptic seizures. The prevalence\nof active epilepsy in the UK is estimated to be 5\u201310/ 1000. The\nclinical manifes tation of a seizure depends on: the cause of epilepsy ,\nthe location of the epileptic focus, and the spread of the epileptic\ndischarge within the brain. Seizures are broadly classified as\ngeneralized when arising in diffuse bilateral networks or focal when\narising from specific areas of the brain. Epilepsy carries significant"

Most of the women survivors tested by\nresearchers had a novel PrP variant G127V that was much less\ncommon in the younger population, indicating that it conferred\nsubstantial protection against the disease. At the time of\npublication in 2003, none of the patients who had, to date,\ncontracted new vCJD in Britain carried the protective genotype.\nThis suggests that this genotype is protective against prion\ndiseases in humans. The researchers then examined DNA from\nvarious ethnic groups around  the world and found that all, except\nthe Japanese, carried the protective genotype to a similar degree.\nGenetic tests showed that this gene could not be there by chance\nbut was a result of natural selection. This implies that ancestral\nhuman populations were exposed to some form of prion disease.\nResearchers concluded that frequent epidemics of prion disease\ncaused by cannibalism in human ancestors would explain the\nworldwide existence of the protective genotype in modern\nhumans."

Despite improvements in our understanding of the pathology of\nthese disorders, their aetiology is currently unknown and there is no definitive diagnostic test available.\nFor this reason, diagnosis is made clinically , using operationally defined criteria (characteristic\nsymptoms and signs) and specific exclusion criteria (e.g. absence of primary organic disorder).\nThe cardinal feature of schizophrenia and related psych otic illnesses is the presence of psychotic\nsymptoms\u2014hallucinations and/or delusions. These symp toms are qualitatively  different from normal\nexperiences, rather than the quantitatively  abnormal responses of neurotic and affective disorders, and\nbecause of this, they are regarded\u2014by patients and other health professionals\u2014as more  serious and\nneeding immediate  psychiatric attention. However , when an individual experiences hallucinations or\nbecomes paranoid that people are talking about them, for example, it does not mean they necessarily\nhave a severe and enduring mental disorder . They could be experiencing a reaction to drugs\n(prescribed or recreational), be experiencing severe anxiety , be acutely confused, or have early signs of\ndementia.

Careful history-taking and\nappropriate investigations (\n  Investigations , p. 193) are essential.\nOf the psychoses, schizophr enia has received the greatest attention in terms of research. This is\nalmost certainly because of the dramatic and devasta ting effects the disorder can have on an\nindividual\u2019 s quality of life and their prospects for employment, marriage, and parenthood. Schizophrenia\naffects about 1 in 100 individu als, usually beginning in late adolescence or early adulthood. Untreated, it\nruns a chronic, deteriorating  course. In addition to the personal tragedy , schizophrenia creates a\nsubstantial public health burden due to the cost of lifelong healthcare needs and lost productivity .\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia are conventionally divided into positive symptoms (an excess or a\ndistortion of normal functioning) and negative symptoms (a decrease or loss of functioning):\n\u2022 Positive symptoms  Delusions (commonly persecutory , thought interference, or passivity delusions).\nHallucinations (usually auditory hallucinations commenting on the subject or referring to them in the\nthird person, e.g. \u2018he looks like a fool\u2019). Formal thought disorder (loss of the normal flow of thinking\nusually shown in the subject\u2019 s speech or writing).\n\u2022 Negative symptoms  Impairment or loss of volitio n, motivation, and spontaneous behaviour . Loss of\nawareness of socially appropriate behaviour and social withdrawal. Flattening of mood, blunting of\naffect, and anhedonia. Poverty of thought and speech.\nFortunately , there are effective interventions that can benefit individuals and help them to lead more\nnormal lives. Current research is directed towards establishing the cause(s) of schizophrenia and\ninvestigating the possibility of early  interventions in those identified at high risk for the disorder or with\nprodromal symptoms (possi ble early signs of the disorder). Other psychoses with more specific\nsymptoms, e.g. delusional misidentification syndromes (\n Delusional misidentification syndromes , p.\n240), may even help us understa nd how we normally perceive the world and help solve the mystery of\nthe true nature of conscious experience.\nWhy are there so few famous people with schizophrenia?\nOften there is a history of declining social and educational function which precludes significant\nachievements (sometimes in spite of early promise). The chronic course of the condition and the major\ndisruptions caused by periods of more severe symptoms also make it less likely that a person with\nschizophrenia will achieve as much as their peers. Until relatively recently , there have been few specific\ntreatments for the disorder , and even today prognosis is at best guarded.\nNonetheless, there are notable exceptions to the rule\u2014pe ople who have battled with the disorder and\nachieved greatness in their chosen fields: in the arts, Vaslov Fomich Nijinski (1891\u20131950), the God of\nthe Dance, whose personal account is to be found in his autobiography The Diary of Vaslov Nijinksy\n(1999); in sport, Lionel Aldridge (1941\u20131998), a member of Vince Lombardi\u2019 s legendary Green Bay\nPackers of the 1960s, who played in two Super Bowls and, until his death, gave inspirational talks on his\nbattle against paranoid schizophrenia; and, in popular music, Roger (Syd) Barrett (1946\u20132006) of Pink\nFloyd and Peter Green (1946\u2013) of Fleetwood Mac. Perhaps the most famous, due to the Academy\nAward-winning dramatization of his life, is the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr (1928\u20132015), who\nwas awarded (jointly with Harsanyi and Selten) the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economic Science for his work\non game theory . His life story  (upon which the film was based) is recorded by Sylvia Nasar in the book A\nBeautiful Mind  (1998).\nHistorical views of schizophrenia\nIn 1856 , More l coined the term D\u00e9mence Pr\u00e9coce  to describe a once bright and active adolescent\npatient who had gradually become silent and withdrawn. Other clinical descriptions included Kahlbaum\u2019 s\nKatatonie  (1868), Griesinger \u2019s primare Verr\u00fccktheit  (1868), Hecker \u2019s Hebephrenie  (1869), and\nSommer \u2019s inclusion of deteriorating paranoid syndromes in the concept of dementia (1894). In 1896,\nEmil Kraepelin described and separated the two major forms of insanity on the basis of different\nsymptoms, course, and outcome. The first, manic-depressive insanity , had a relaps ing and remitting\ncourse, with full recovery after each episode. The second grouped together catatonia, hebephrenia, and\nthe paranoid psychoses under the term dementia praecox , which  had a progressive, deteriorating\ncourse where any improvement was only partial.\nOver the next two decades (and further revisions of his textbook), Kraepelin\u2019 s ideas were gradually\naccepted. Later the influence of Freud\u2019 s psychoanalytic al ideas shifted the focus from Kraepelin\u2019 s\n\u2018disease of the brain\u2019 to a \u2018splitting of the mind\u2019 (schizophrenia), as proposed by Eugen Bleuler in his"

            "Text": "book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias  (1911). He believed the disorder to be due to a\n\u2018loosening of associations\u2019 between psychic functions, with fundamental symptoms being thought\ndisorder , blunting/incongruity  of affect, autism, and ambi valence. He added \u2018simple schizophrenia\u2019 to\nKraepelin\u2019 s subtypes and did not consider hallucination s, delusions, and catatonic symptoms to be\nnecessary for the diagnosis. This view of schizophrenia was to have a profound influence on clinical\npractice, particularly in the USA.\nEuropean psychiatrists continued to regard schizophre nia as a disease of the brain. Detailed\nclassification systems were developed based on symptom atology , culminating in the teachings of Kurt\nSchneider , who described \u2018symptoms of first rank\u2019 in the acute phase of the illness (\n Dictionary of\npsychiatric symptoms , p. 110) and \u2018second-rank symptoms\u2019 which, although highly suggestive of\nschizophrenia, could also occur in other psychoses (e.g. emotional blunting, perplexity , and other kinds\nof delusions and hallucinations).\nThe differences in diagnostic practices were highlighted in the 1970s. In 1972, Cooper found identical\nsymptomatology in psychiatric admissions in New York and London, but higher rates of schizophrenia\ndiagnosed in New York. Similarly, in 1973, the WHO\u2019 s International pilot study of schizophrenia  found\nthe incidence of schizophren ia, using agreed diagnostic criteria, to be 0.7\u20131.4 per 10 000 aged 15\u201354\nacross all countries studied, but with much higher rates of diagnosis evident in the USA and the USSR.\nThis was expla ined by broader syndrome definition in the USA with milder abnormalities considered part\nof the schizop hrenia spectru m, and in the USSR due to the political pressure to declare dissidents\ninsane.\nThis led to an international push towards operationally defined criteria (based on symptoms and\ncourse), with various systems  proposed. The St Louis Criteria (Feighner et al. 1972) require the patient\nto have been continuously ill for 6mths, with no prom inent affective symptoms, the presence of\ndelusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder , and for personal and family history to be taken into\naccount (mari tal status, age under 40, premorbid social adjustment). Other systems adopt the\nSchneiderian concept of schizophrenia, including Catego (Wing et al. 1974)\u2014a computer program that\nuses the Present State Examination (PSE) to generate diagnoses; Spitzer et al.\u2019s (1975) research\ndiagnostic criteria (RDC)\u2014re quiring at least 2wks duration, lack of affective symptoms, presence of\nthought disorder , and hallucinations and delusions similar to Schneiderian first-rank symptoms; as well\nas the ICD-10 (WHO 1992). The American Psychiatric Association\u2019 s DSM-5 (2013) has dispensed with\nSchneiderian first-rank auditory hallucinations (2+ voices conversing) but requires the presence of at\nleast one of delusions, hallucinations, or disorganised speech. (\n The diagnosis of schizophre nia, p.\n184). ICD-11 proposals (2018) consider persistent delusio ns, hallucinations, thought disorder , and\nfeelings of passivity , influence or control, as core symptoms.\nWith the advent of neuroima ging, the biological substrate of schizophrenia could be investigated in\nthe living brain . In 1974 Ingva r and Franz\u00e9n showed, with the aid of radiolabelled xenon gas, that blood\nflow was reduced in the frontal lobes. In 1976 Johnstone et al. publish ed the first controlled CT brain\nstudy , which found enlarged ventricles associated with poorer cognitive performance. In the absence of\nan aetiological model of schizophrenia, pathophysiological models were developed to describe and\nexplain the varieties of presentations found. In 1980 Crow described his \u2018Two syndrome hypothesis\u2019,\ndividing schizophrenia into type 1 (predominant  positive symptoms, acute onset, good premorbid\nadjustment, good treatment response, normal cognition and brain structure, reversible neurochemical\ndisturbance) and type 2 (predominant negative symptoms, insidious onset, poor premorbid adjustment,\npoor treatment response, impaired cognition, structural brain abnormalities [ventricular enlargement]\nunderlying irreversible neuronal loss). The first quantitative MRI study by Andreasen et al. in 1986 also\ndemonstrated smaller frontal lobes, and reduced intracran ial and cerebral volume: further evidence for\nschizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder .\nBased upon examination of symptomatology and functional brain imaging Liddle (1992) proposed his\n\u2018Three syndrome hypothesis of schizophrenia\u2019: (1) Psychomotor poverty syndrome \u2014poverty of speech,\nflattened affect, and decreased spontaneous movement; hypoperfusion of left dorsal prefrontal cortex,\nextending to the medial prefrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex and hypoperfusion in the head of\ncaudate; reduc ed ability to generate action; (2) Disorganization syndrome \u2014disorders of form of thought\nand inappropriate affect; hypo perfusion of right ventral prefrontal cortex and increased activity in anterior\ncingulate and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei projecting to the prefrontal cortex; relative hypoperfusion of\nBroca\u2019 s area and bilateral hypoperfusion of parietal association cortex; reduced ability to inhibit"

There are some differences between countries, although these differences\nare minimized when a restrictive definition of schizophrenia, based on first-rank symptoms, is used.\nFertility\nEarly studies reported low fertility in both men and women with schizophrenia.

Suicide is the most\ncommon cause of premature death in schizophrenia. It accounts for 10\u201338% of all deaths in\nschizophrenia.

The range of possible\npresentations is very wide; however , the following presentations (or their variants) are commonly seen:\n\u2022A spouse or relative noticing withdrawn or bizarre behaviour .\n\u2022Failure to achieve educational potential with referral by school or student health services.\n\u2022Onset of personality change, social withdrawal, and \u2018odd\u2019 behaviour .\n\u2022Presentation via the criminal justice system (see section on schizophrenia and offending, \n  Mental\ndisorder and of fending 2: specific disorders and of fending , p. 746).\n\u2022Presentation following deliberate self-harm or suicide attempt.\n\u2022Complaining to the council/police, etc. on the basis of delusional symptoms (e.g. hearing voices of\nneighbours throughout the night).\n\u2022Occasionally , the first sign may be symptoms more typically characteristic of another disorder (e.g.\ndepression, mania, OCD, panic disorder).\nThe first episode of schizophrenia is often a time of diagnostic uncertainty (and occasionally the\ndiagnosis may take months/years to become clear). Frequently , the clinical picture includes comorbid\nsubstance misuse, personality difficulties, recent stressful life events, or a combination of all three. It is\nusually necessary to admit people suspected of first schizophrenic episodes in order to assess the\nextent of their psychopathology , to provide a time for education of both the patient and their family , and\nto provide pharmacological and psychological treatments in an environment where compliance can be\ncarefully asses sed. If local early intervention (see Box 5.2) or crisis intervention and home treatment\nservices are sufficiently well developed, it may be possible to provide a viable less restrictive option to\nadmission. Inpatient admissi on is always necessary where the patient poses a significant danger to\nthemselves or others.\nSubsequent episodes\nSubsequent presentations may be due to relapse of psychotic symptoms after remission, a deterioration\nor a change in the quality of partially treated psychotic symptoms, or a crisis relating to life events in a\npatient who, as a result of their illness, has an impaired ability to manage stress.\nRelapses can occur spontaneously in the absence of causative factors and in spite of good\ncompliance with antipsychotic treatment.

Symptoms may range from mild paranoid ideas to elaborate and firmly held\ndelusions with associated auditory hallucinations urging the patient to violence. Often it is difficult to\nestablish a clear history initially , and assessment is focused on the immediate concerns:\n\u2022The risk they currently pose to themselves\u2014not just the possibility of acts of self-harm or suicide, but\nalso because of other aspects of their behaviour (e.g. police becoming involved, family relationships,\nwork, continued driving, etc.).\n\u2022Risk of violence\u2014the nature of risk (\n Assessing risk of violence , p. 748) and any association with\ncurrent sympto ms (e.g. delusions about a specific person or group of individuals; what the \u2018voices\u2019 are\ntelling them to do).\n\u2022The degree of insight retained by the patient and the likelihood of them cooperating with medical\nmanagement.\n\u2022Whether hospi tal admission or transfer to a psychiatric ward is warranted to assess and manage the\nacute symptoms [with or without use of the Mental Health Act (MHA)].\n\u2022Whether their current behaviour is so disturbed as to require urgent treatment (\n Severe behavioural\ndisturbance , p. 1048 ) to allow further assessment, including physical examination and other routine\ninvestigations (\n  Investigations , p. 193).\n\u2022The person\u2019 s current social circumstances and the level of support available to them [partner ,\nrelatives, friends, community psychiatric nurse (CPN), etc.] that may allow some flexibility in\nmanagement (as well as being a source of third-party information).\nThe greatest influence on your course of action will often be the reason why the person has been\nreferred in the first place (e.g. brought up by a concerned relative, no longer able to be managed at\nhome, breach of the peace, self-referral because of own concerns, attempted suicide).\nWhen there is a good accou nt of the history of the presenting complaint(s), it may be possible to\nestablish the most likely diagnosis and proceed accordingly , e.g. a drug- or alcohol-related disorder ,\nacute confusional state (\n Acute confusional state (delir ium), p. 854), first episode of schizophren ia (\nThe first schizo phrenic episo de, p. 196), relapse of known schizophrenia (\n Subsequent episodes , p.\n196), delusional disorder (\n Delusional disorder 1: clinical features , p. 230), and acute psychotic\ndisorder (\n  Acute and transient psychotic disorders , p. 236).\nDuring initial assessment, particularly with unmedicated  patients, record (verbatim, if possible) specific\naspects of the patient\u2019 s psychopathology (nature and content of delusions and hallucinations), before\nthey become modified by the necessary use of medication. This information is important, as it will\ninfluence later decisions regarding, for example, assessment of treatment response and the need for\ncontinued use of the MHA.\nMany patients with a psychotic presentation will have comorbid drug and/or alcohol problems. The\nfact that the psychotic episode is suspected to be wholly or partially attributable to comorbid substance\nuse should not be allowed to affect the treatment offered acutely , which should be planned on the basis\nof the nature and severity of the psychotic symptoms and the associated risk. On recovery from the\nacute episode, the comorbid substance use should become a focus for clinical attention.\nThe need for hospital admission\nAs noted previously (\n Issues affecting initial management decisions , p. 198), certain clinical features\nand situations will determine whether hospital admission (or transfer to a psychiatric ward) is necessary:\n\u2022High risk of suicide or homicide.\n\u2022Other illness-related behaviour that endangers relationships, reputation, or assets.\n\u2022Severe psychotic, depressive, or catatonic symptoms.\n\u2022Lack of capacity to cooperate with treatment."

As far as possible, the person should be nursed in calm surroundings (a single room, if\npossible), with minimal stimulation (e.g. unfamiliar people, TV, radio). A balance should be struck\nbetween the need for regular observation and the likelihood that this may reinforce persecutory\ndelusions.

It is good practice to establ ish baseline measures of physical health prior\nto commencing antipsychotic treatment (\n  Physical health monitoring and antipsychotics , p. 1040 ).\nOption 1\n\u2022Commence a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) [e.g. olanzapine, amisulpride, risperidone,\nquetiapine; see \n  Second-generation antipsychotics 1 & 2, pp. 201\u2013213)] at an effectiv e dose [see\nthe British National Formulary  (BNF)].\n\u2022Use long-acting BDZ (e.g. diazepam) to control non-acute anxiety/behavioural disturbance.\nOption 2\n\u2022Prescribe a low-potency first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) (such as chlorpromazine, initially in the\nrange of 75\u2013200mg/d in divided doses) for a first episode.\n\u2022Increase the dose according to clinical ef fect and the need for sedation.\n\u2022Previous episo des and the response/side effects experienced should inform the management of\nsubsequent episodes.\n\u2022No additional antipsychotic benefit is likely when doses of 400\u2013600mg chlorpromazine (or equivalent)\nare exceeded; however , sedation may be a useful ef fect of increasing the dose above this level.\nExtra-pyramidal side ef fects\nEPSEs, includ ing dystonias, Parkinsonism, and akathisia, are common side effects of treatment with\nantipsychotic medication and are a frequent cause of non-compliance.\n\u2022EPSEs are less likely with option 1, although the tolerability of both options overall is approximately\nequal.\n\u2022Prescribe procyclidine (or alternative) orally , as required, for Parkinsonian side ef fects.\n\u2022Review regularly , since requirement for procyclidine may diminish over time and the drug may\ncontribute to non-response and tardive dyskinesia.\nMaintenance phase\nPost-acute phase\nWith the emergence of \u2018stabil ity\u2019 (i.e. less active psychotic symptoms and less behavioural disturbance),\ntreatment shifts towards the gradual simplification of medication regimes and maximization of tolerability .\nThe patient may be more able to engage actively with other therapeutic modalities available in the\nhospital environment. Time to remission of symptoms is very variable and may take 3\u20139mths or more. It\nis important the patient and their family/friends have realistic expectations.\nContinuing treatment\nA more considered view of management may be taken once maximal improvements are considered to\nhave occurred. This is the time to establish the minimal effective dose of medication , and maintenance\nregimes can often be significantly lower than those needed for management of the acute phase of the\nillness. A secondary goal is the minimization of side effects, with the aim of establishing compliance with\nmedication.

The final steps in this process may require\ninput, where available, of better resourced multidisciplinary rehabilitation units or community teams over\nmany months, with the ultimate aims of successful discharge (\n Discharge planning , p. 204) and\noutpatient follow-up (\n  Outpatient treatment and follow-up , p. 206).\nComorbid depression\nDepression can affect up to 70% of patients in the acute phase but tends to remit along with the\npsychosis. In the maintenance phase, post-psychotic or post-schizophrenic depression occurs in up to\none-third of patients and there is some evidence that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g. imipramine)\nmay be effective. Surprisingly , despite it being comm on clinical practice, there are few studies\nsupporting other interventions such as SSRIs.\nManaging negative symptoms\nSpecific interventions may help to mitigate the impact of persistent negative symptoms:\n\u2022Ensure EPSE s (especially bradykinesia) are detected  and treated with anticholinergics, with\namantadine, by reducing antipsychotics, or by switching to lower-potency/SGA agents.\n\u2022If there is evidence of dysphoric mood, consider treating with antidepressants, with anxiolytics, by\nreducing the antipsychotic dose, with supportive management, or by switching to an SGA.\n\u2022Address the contribution of the environment (e.g. institutionalization, lack of stimulation) by\nresocialization and/or rehabilitation.\n\u2022If the patient is on long-term medication, consider reductio n to minimal reasonable maintenance dose\nor switching to an SGA or clozapine.\n\u2022If cloza pine is prescribed, consider augmentation with an antidepressant, lamotrigine, or a suitable\nsecond antipsychotic (\n  An approach to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) , p. 216).\nAddressing comorbid substance use\nAs previously noted, there is significant comorbidity of substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia.\nWhile this may complicate and exacerbate positive and negative symptoms, sometimes patients believe\nthey are self-medicating and may be reluctant to give up a \u2018useful\u2019 treatment. Elements of a pragmatic\napproach include:\n\u2022A comprehensive assessment, including why and how substances are taken, as well as routine testing\nfor substance misuse.\n\u2022Optimization of antipsychotic  medication and considerati on of clozapine for patients with persisting\nsubstance misuse.\n\u2022The offer of specific treatment for substance misuse and possibly referral to local drug and alcohol\nservices\u2014while psychosocial approaches will be the mainstay (including relapse prevention), the\npossible benef its of pharmacotherapy should not be ignored, e.g. nicotine substitution/withdrawal,\nalcohol detoxification, and opiate substitution.\nDischarge planning\nGood communication between members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) (psychiatry , community\nnurse, GP, social worker , etc.) is essential for good overall care. This may be formalized using the care\nprogramme approach (CPA) (\n Aftercare following detention , p. 954), but when this is not mandatory ,\ncomponents of this approach may be useful in everyday practice.\nPre-discharge meetings\nPrior to leaving hospital, a meeting should be arranged with all those involved in a person\u2019 s care,\nincluding inform al carers and key clinical staff. In some areas, Crisis Teams/Community Teams with\nCrisis Services will work intensively with people to facilitate early discharge and should be alerted of\nplans for discharge well in advance.\nDischarge plans\nDischarge plans should includ e information on everyone involved in a person\u2019 s care and should be clear\nabout who is coordinating the care (e.g. key nurse, formal care coordinator , responsible medic). Plans\nshould include explicit outcom es or expectations and follow-up arrangements, and it must be clear how\nhelp will be available in a crisis (e.g. contact numbers or formal relapse management/safety plan). All\ndischarge plans should include a risk assessment and information on how risks will be managed."

High-dose prescribing refers either to the\nprescription of a single antipsychotic at doses greater than the BNF maxim um or the prescription of\ntwo or more antipsychotics with a combined chlorpromazine equivalent dose of >1g daily (see Table\n5.3). Although there may be a therapeutic response to this approach in some individual patients, there\nis no evidence  that high-dos e prescribing  confers any therapeutic advantage in first-episode\npsychosis, acute psychotic episodes, relapse prevention, emergency tranquillization, persistent\naggression, or treatment resistance. There is clear evide nce for greater side effect burden and the\nneed for appropriate safety monitoring. The Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 most recent guidance1\nsuggests that:\n\u2022Any prescription of high-dose antipsychotic medication should be seen as an explicit, time-limited,\nindividual trial, with a distinct treatment target.\n\u2022There should be a clear plan for regular clinical review , including safety monitoring (\n Physical\nhealth monitoring and antipsychotics , p. 1040 ).\n\u2022The trial of high-dose treatment should only be continued if there is clear evidence that the benefits\noutweigh any tolerability or safety problems.\n\u2022In most areas, local protocols will exist for the purpose of ensuring good medical practice.\n1 Royal College of Psychiatrists London, Council Report CR190 (Nov 2014) Consensus statement on high-dose antipsychotic\nmedication . \n https://www .rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/college-reports/college-report-cr190.pdf?\nsfvrsn=54f5d9a2_2  [accessed 30 May 2018].\nAetiology\nThe aetiology is uncertain. However , the following factors may be important:\n\u2022Neurodevelopmental factors: soft signs, history of obstetric complications, cognitive impairment.\n\u2022Drug non-compliance.\n\u2022Lack of adequate treatment:  poor drug administration/absorption. However , over-treatment (>12mg\nhaloperidol or equivalent) may also lead to poor tolerability/response.\n\u2022Aggravating factors despite  adequate treatment: concurrent drug or alcohol misuse, anticholinergic\neffects of anti-Parkinsonian medication or antidepressants.\nManagement"

In more difficult cases,\naugmentation of clozapine with benzamides (sulpiride, amisulpride) and antiepileptics (lamotrigine)\nshows some success.14 ECT may be another option.15\n\u2022 Rehabilitation  Consider the role of NHS /non-NHS rehabiliation facilities in maximizing function,\nmaintaining quality of life, and supporting those who remain symptomatic despite treatment\u2014best\nevidence supports a combination of medication with psychosocial treatments.\nClozapine 1: general guidelines\nClozapine, an SGA, is a dibenzodiazepine derivative. Shortly after its introduction to clinical practice in\nthe mid-1970s, it was withdrawn because of several episodes of fatal agranulocytosis in patients on\ntreatment. It was thought to have special efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and this clinical\nbelief was supported by an important trial by Kane et al. (1988), leading to its reintroduction in\npsychiatric practice, albeit with strict limitations to its prescription. Patients on clozapine and doctors\nprescribing the drug must be registered with a monitoring agency and have regular , initially weekly ,\nFBCs to monitor for neutropenia.\nIn the CATIE trial,16 clozapine was shown to be superior in both treatment response (positive and\nnegative symptoms) and compliance for patients who failed to improve on an SGA, randomized to\nreceive either another SGA or clozapine. Recent evidence  from a meta-analysis found it to be superior\nfor treatment-refractory disorder but recommended that if there is no response by 6mths, medications\nwith lower adverse reactions should be considered.17\nNICE guideline\nNICE (2014)18 recommends offering cloza pine \u2018to people with schizophrenia whose illness has not\nresponded adequately to treatment despite the sequential use of adequate doses of at least 2 different\nantipsychotic drugs\u2019 (at least one of which was a non-clozapine SGA).\nMode of action\nClozapine mainly blocks D1 and D4 receptors; with less effect on D2 receptors than traditional FGAs\n(which may partially explain its lack of EPSEs and hyperprolactinaemia). Clozapine does have\nsignificant anticholinergic, antihistaminergic, and anti-adrenergic activity , which accounts for its common\nside effects (\n Clozapine 3: side effects , p. 222). The superior efficacy of clozapine in treating resistant\nschizophrenic patients may be due to its additional blockade of 5HT2 receptors or it causing \n  turnover\nof GABA in the nucleus accumbens, which inhibits dopaminergic neurons.\nPharmacokinetics\nRapidly absorb ed when taken orally (unaf fected by food). Extensive first-pass metabolism (only 27\u201350%\nof a dose reaches the systemic circulation unchanged). Wide interindividual variations in the resulting\nplasma concen trations (influe nced by factors such as smoking, hepatic metabolism, gastric absorption,\nage, and possibly gender). Steady-state plasma concentrations take 7\u201310 days of treatment. Mean\nterminal elimination half-life ranges from 6 to 33hrs. Onset of antipsychotic effect may take several\nweeks, but maximal ef fects can require several months (and improvement may continue for up to 2yrs).\nInteractions\n(See Table 5.4  for summary .)\n\u2022Lithium can increase the risk of developing seizures, confusion, dyskinesia, and possibly NMS.\n\u2022May interfere with the action of AChEIs (e.g. donepezil and tacrine)."

Symptoms should have been present for at least 1mth (DSM-5). ICD-10/1 1 specify at\nleast 3mths for delusional disorder  but, if it is less than this, allow diagnosis under other persistent\ndelusional disorder (ICD-10) or delusional disorder , unspecified (ICD-1 1). DSM- 5 has particular\nsubtypes (see Box 5.9 ).\nBox 5.9 DSM-5 subtypes1\n\u2022 Erotomanic (D e Cl\u00e9rambau lt syndrome)  Patients present with the belief that some important\nperson is secretly in love with them and may make efforts to contact that person. Clinical samples\nare often \u2640 and forensic samples more likely to be \u2642. Some cases are associated with dangerous\nor assaultive behaviour .\n\u2022 Grandiose  Patients believe they fill some special role, have some special relationship, or possess\nsome special ability(ies).They may be involved with social or religious organizations.\n\u2022 Jealous2 (Othello syndrome)  Patients possess the fixed belief that their spouse or partner has\nbeen unfaithful. Often patients try to collect evidence and/or attempt to restrict their partner \u2019s\nactivities. May be associated with forensic cases involving murder .\n\u2022 Persecutory  This is the most common presentation of delusional disorder . Patients are convinced\nthat others are attempting to do them harm. Often they attempt to obtain legal recourse (litigious or\n\u2018querulous paranoia\u2019), and they sometimes may resort to violence.\n\u2022 Somatic  Varying presentation, from those who have repeat contact with physicians requesting\nvarious forms of medical or surgical treatment to patients who are delusionally concerned with\nbodily infestation, deformity (\n Body dysmorphic disorder , p. 872), or odour (\n Olfactory reference\ndisorder (ORD) , p. 388).\n\u2022 Mixed  Presence of 2+ themes; no single theme predominating.\n\u2022 Unspecified  The theme cannot be determined or does not fit the listed categories.1\n1 ICD-10 subtypes are similar: Erotoma nic, Grandiose, Jealous, Persecutory , Litigious, Hypochondriacal, and Self-referential. ICD-1 1\ndelusional subtypes are dif ferentiated in a section \u2018Mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings\u2019 and include: bizarre, being\ncontrolled, guilt, reference, erotomanic , grandiose, jealous, persecutory , religious, somatic, nihilistic, misidentification, impoverishment,\nother , and unspecified.\n2 Shepherd M (1961 ) Morbid jealousy: some clinical and social aspects of a psychiatric symptom.

For example:\n\u2022 Persistent auditory hallucinations  Occurring in the absence of any other features.\n\u2022 Delusions with significantly overlapping mood episo des Persis tent delusions with periods of\noverlapping mood episodes longer than just brief mood episodes allowed in delusional disorder .\n\u2022 Attenuated psychosis syndrome  Psychotic-like symptoms below the threshold for full psychosis\n(e.g. less severe, more transient, insight relatively maintained).\n\u2022 Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional disorder  (see opposite).\nDelusional misidentification syndromes\nUsually manife st as symptoms of an underlying disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, mood disorder , delusional\ndisorder , organic disorder), these syndromes rarely occur in isolation and hence are not included\nseparately in ICD-10/1 1 or DSM-5. Recently , interest has been focused on these rare (and bizarre)\nsymptoms because of the insight they may give into the normal functioning of the brain (a \u2018lesion\u2019\nparadigm).\nExamples\nCapgras delusion  (l\u2019illusion des sosies ) The patient believes others have been replaced by\nidentical/near-identical impos ters.

The individual is often thought to be pursuing or persecuting the\npatient.\nIntermetamorphosis delusion  The patient believes they can see others change (usually temporarily)\ninto someone else (both external appearance and internal personality).\nSubjective doubles delusion  The patient believes there is a double (\u2018doppelg\u00e4nger \u2019) who exists and\nfunctions independently .\nAutoscopic syndrome  The patient sees a double of themselves projected onto other people or\nobjects nearby .\nReverse subje ctive double syndrome  The patient believes they are an imposter , in the process  of\nbeing physically and psychologically replaced.\nReverse Fr\u00e9goli syndrome  The patient believes others have completely misidentified them.\nAetiology\nPsychodynamic  These syndromes are viewed as the extremes of normal misidentification due to\nintense focusin g on particular details; the effects of beliefs/emotions on perception; the effects of vivid\nimagination in a person experiencing a disorder of mood, judgement, and coenesthesia; and\nmanifestations of the defence  mechanisms of projection, splitting, or regression with loss of identity and\nflawed reconstruction.\nBiological  There may be evidence of underlying right hemisphe re dysfunction, anterior cortical\natrophy , temporal lobe pathology , bifrontal disconnectivit y\u2014with resultant impaired facial recognition,\ndissociation of sensory information from normal affect, and failure to suppress inappropriate, repetitive\nbehaviour .\nManagement\n\u2022Full physical and psychiatric assessment.\n\u2022Interventions should be directed towards any underlying problem.\n\u2022Antipsychotics/anticonvulsants may also treat clearly organic cases.\n1 \u2018Schizophrenia\u2019 in ICD-1 1 proposals is characterized by \u2018disturbances in multiple mental modalities, including: thinking (e.g. delusions,\ndisorganization in the form of thought), perception (e.g. hallucinations), self-experience (e.g. the experience that one\u2019s feelings, impulses,\nthoughts, or behaviour are under the control of an external force), cognition (e.g. impaired attention, verbal memory , and social cognition),\nvolition (e.g. loss of motivation), affect (e.g. blunted emotional expressio n), and behaviour (e.g. behaviour that appears bizarre or\npurposeless, unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with the organization of behaviour)\u2019.

The term disappeared from use until the nineteenth\ncentury when, in 1838, the German pathologist Karl Wilhe lm Stark (1787\u20131845) used it to differentiate\ndisorders of mood from those of the will (dysbulias) and intellect (dysnoesias). Carl Friedrich\nFlemming (1799\u20131880) is attributed as the first psychiatrist to use the term in 1844. Flemming, who\nfounded the Allgemeine Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychiatrie , distinguished  between disorders of intellect\n(anoesia), disorders of mood (dysthymia), and disorder of both intellect and mood (mania). He was\none of the first psychiatrists to draw a distinction betw een affective disorders, which he termed\n\u2018dysthymias\u2019, and non-af fective disorders. Influenced by the writings of Kahlbaum (1863), he later\nchanged his views to a system based more on clinical observation and course than theoretical\nconcepts, distinguishing disorders of mood (dysthymia) , disorders of intelligence (paranoia), and\ndisorders of will (diastrephia).\nKraepelin, in his textbooks (1909\u20131915), did not keep the term \u2018dysthymia\u2019, although, regarding the\n\u2018depressive constitution\u2019, he wrote:\n\u2018 \u2026 they show a certain sensitivity for life\u2019s sorrows, grieves and disappointments. Everything is burdensome for them \u2026 Their\nwhole course of life is strongly influenced by their suffering. \u2026 They feel weak, without energy . \u2026 Sleep is normally insuf ficient;\nthese patients have a great urge for sleep, but they fall asleep very late \u2026 , in the morning they do not feel refreshed but tired \u2026\nThe illness described here normally first manifests during adolescence and may persist without major changes throughout life.\u2019\nDue to the influence of psychodynamic thinking in the mid-twentieth century , dysthymia was\novershadowed by \u2018neurotic (psychogenic) depression\u2019. Eugen Kahn (1928) and Karl Leonhard (1968)\ndid utilize the term to describe  persons with \u2018psychopathic personalities\u2019 who had chronically disturbed\nor irritable mood. However , the antidepressant era\u2014fr om the 1960s onward\u2014brought with it a\nrevolution in thinking about affective disorders, culminating in the sidelining of \u2018neurotic depression\u2019 in\nDSM-III with a compromise diagnosis of \u2018dysthymic disorder (neurotic depression)\u2019. There was a\ngrowing consensus that dysthymia described a disabling chronic mood disorder that was treatable\npharmacologically (ergo: not a personality disorder). While DSM-IV maintained \u2018dysthymic disorder \u2019\nwithin the depressive disord ers, ICD-10 placed it in a subcategory of \u2018persistent mood disorders\u2019,\nalong with cyclothymia (\n Cyclothymia , p. 348), with the emphasis on chronic, low-grade symptoms.\nMore recently , DSM-5 uses the term \u2018persistent depressi ve disorder \u2019 to consolidate DSM-IV -defined\n\u2018chronic major depressive disorder \u2019 and \u2018dysthymic disorder \u2019, with the emphasis on chronicity . It looks\nlike ICD-1 1 will put \u2018dysthymic disorder \u2019 back into the depressive disorders but keep it as a less\nsevere form of depressive disorder .\nAntidepressants\nAssumed mode of action\nAll currently available antid epressants appear to exert antidepressant action by increasing the\navailability of monoamines (5-HT , NA, and DA) via one or more of the following:\n\u2022Presynaptic inhibition of reuptake of 5-HT , NA, or DA.\n\u2022Antagonist activity at presynaptic inhibitory 5-HT or NA receptor sites, which enhances\nneurotransmitter release.\n\u2022Inhibition of monoamine oxidase, reducing neurotransmitter breakdown.\n\u2022Increasing the availability of neurotransmitter precursors.\nAlthough this net increase happens almost immediately following administration, initial resolution of\ndepressive symptoms generally takes 10\u201320 days, implying therapeutic effect involves mechanisms\npossibly related to receptor regulation over time/changes in intracellular signalling.\nSelectivity vs specificity\nAlthough the newer antidepressants are more selective  than TCAs and MAOIs in their pharmacological\neffects, this should not be confused with them being more specific  for any particu lar type of depressive\nsymptoms. All antidepressants have unwanted and often unpleasant side effects. A balance needs to be\nstruck between  efficacy in treating psychiatric symptoms and the possibility of iatrogenic problems.\nPatients may not be able to tolerate the anticholinergic side effects of TCAs or will be unable to achieve\na therapeutic level because of side effects.

A recent\nsystematic review of published clinical treatment studies  for mood disorders, while highlighting the\nmethodological shortcomings of such other publications, did find clear evidence of clinician-judged\nimprovement after treatment with psychedelics in 79.2% of participants.1 At the very least, there are\nreasonable grounds for further investigations using more robust methodologies. In one recently\ncompleted pilot study in the UK,2 psilocybin was tested with psychological support for treatment-\nresistant depre ssive disorde r. After a single 25mg dose  of psilocybin, depressive symptoms were\nmarkedly reduced at 1wk and 3mths, with marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and\nanhedonia. Another study giving psilocybin to cancer patients3 found marked improvement s in both\nclinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety , along with increases in quality of\nlife, life meaning, and optimis m and decreases in death anxiety that were sustained at 6-mth follow-\nup.

Presuming ignorance (\u2018we don\u2019t really know how it\nworks, but it does \u2026 \u2019) ignores real progress in our understanding of ECT .\n\u2022Rejected theories: psychoa nalytical views  of ECT efficacy as due to \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018regression\u2019, or\n\u2018punishment\u2019; brain injury theory  (\n Box 6.12, p. 309); amnestic theory \u2014ECT has some effects on\ncognitive function (\n  ECT 6: side effects and other specific problems , p. 308), but it is not the primary\nmode of action.\n\u2022Anticonvulsant/altered functional activity theory:  ECT acts as a powerful anticonvulsant (increases\nseizure thresh old, delta activity , and inhibitory transmit ters, e.g. GABA and opioids), causing a\nreduction in functional activity  within, and in connectivity between, specific brain regions related to the\ntherapeutic response (regional cerebral blood flow/glucose metabolism show reduction in anterior\nfrontal regions  post-ictally and for weeks to months after, associated with better outcomes and\ncorrelating with raised seizure threshold).\n\u2022Anti-delirium/restorative sleep theory:  ECT does lead to EEG changes (e.g. \n  delta activity with\ngreater amplitude and reduced frequency) similar to those seen in normal sleep and correlated with\nclinical improvement. Whether this is a therapeutic action or an (albeit important) epiphenomenon is\nnot certain.\n\u2022Neurochemical theories:  despite  the fact that neuroc hemical explanations have been advocated for\nexplaining how ECT works, supporting evidence comes from pre-clinical and animal work. Preliminary\nhuman studies support a role for DA and GABA/glutamate.\n\u2022Neuroendocrine theory:  it is proposed that ECT work s by correcting a dysregulation of neuropeptides\nthrough dience phalic stimula tion. Studies have found ECT enhances the production and release of\nseveral neuropeptides (e.g. TRH, prolactin, corticotropin, cortisol, oxytocin, vasopressin, \u03b2-endorphin,\nand, less consistently , GH). However , these changes could be non-specific effects of stress/seizure,\nand not necessarily the therapeutic ef fect of ECT .\n\u2022Other (speculative): neurogenesis \u2014the animal model of ECT has been shown to promote\nneurogenesis in non-human primates; gene transcription \u2014the likelihoo d of remission with ECT in\npatients with treatment-resistant depression has been associated with two polymorphisms related to\nDA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) \u2014preliminary\nevidence suggests serum BDNF concentrations increase after ECT .\nBox 6.10 ECT : an historical perspective\nThe use of convulsive treatments for psychiatric disorder s originated with the clinical observation of\napparent antagonism between schizophrenia (then dementia praecox ) and epilepsy . Patients who had\na seizu re were  relieved of their psychotic symptoms, and Meduna noted \n  glial cells in the brains of\npatients with epilepsy , compared with reduced numbers  in those with schizophrenia. In 1934, he\ninduced a seizure with an injection of camphor-in-oil in a patient with catatonic schizophrenia and\ncontinued this treatment every 3 days. After the fifth seizure, the patient was able to talk\nspontaneously and began to eat and care for himself for the first time in 4yrs, making a full recovery\nwith three further treatments . Chemically induced convulsive treatments using camphor or metrazol\n(pentylenetetrazol) became accepted for the treatment of schizophrenia but had problems. Cerletti\nand Bini introduced the use of \u2018electric shock\u2019 to induce seizures in 1938, a method that became the\nstandard.

Local policy and the type of ECT machine\nused will dictate which method is preferred.  For example:\n\u2022Dose titration:  the most accurate method, delivering the minimum stimulus necessary to produce an\nadequate seizure, and therefore to be preferred. Treatment begins with a low stimulus, with the dose \ngradually until an adequate seizure is induced. Once the approximate seizure threshold is known, the\nnext treatment dose is \n to about 50\u2013100% (for BECT) or 100\u2013200% (for UECT\u2014some protocols\n500\u2013800%) above the threshold. The dose is only \n  further if later treatments are sub-therapeutic, and\nthe amount of dose increase will be governed by local policy .\n\u2022Age dosing:  selection of a predetermined dose calculated on the basis of the patient\u2019 s age (and the\nECT machine used). The main advantage is that this is a less complex regime. However , there is the\npossibility of \u2018overdosing\u2019 (i.e. inducing excessive cognitive  side effects) because the seizure threshold\nis not determined.\nAs ECT itself raises the seizure threshold, the dose is likely to rise by an average of 80% over the\nlength of a treatment course. Higher (or lower) doses will also be needed when the patient is taking\ndrugs that raise (or lower) the seizure threshold (see Table 6.7 ).\nEffective treatment\nWhen a sub-therapeutic treatment is judged to have occurred, the treatment is repeated at different\nenergy settings (\n  Energy dosing, see above).\n\u2022EEG monitoring:  the gold standard, with an ictal EEG having typical phases (see Fig. 6.3). The\npresence of these features [Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 ECT Handbook  \u2018new\u2019 (2005/1 3) criteria),\nno matter how short the seizure activity , is deemed to constitute a therapeutic treatment. Usually the\nictal EEG activity lasts 25\u2013130s (motor seizure ~20% less).\n\u2022Timing of convulsion:  where EEG monitoring is not used, the less reliable measure of length of\nobservable motor seizure is used, with an effective treatment defined as a motor seizure lasting at\nleast 15s from the end of the ECT dose to the end of observable motor activity [Royal College of\nPsychiatrists\u2019 ECT Handbook  \u2018old\u2019 (1995) criteria].\n\u2022Cuff technique:  often an under-used technique, involving the isolation of a forearm or leg from the\neffects of muscle relaxant, by inflation of a BP cuff to above the systolic pressure. As the isolated limb\ndoes not become paralysed, the motor seizure can be more easily observed.\nECT 5: further notes on treatment\nOther physiological effects of ECT\n\u2022Musculoskeletal\u2014direct stimulation:  tonic contrac tion\u2014opisthotonus, supraphysiological bite (not\nblocked by relaxants; may cause dental injury; bite-block essential); generalized (tonic\u2013clonic) seizure\n\u2014risk of fractures (vertebral, long bone, avulsion)."

More significant personality change and impaired social or cognitive\nfunctioning are infrequent, and there is more likely to be improvement.\nOutcome\nGiven the treatment-resistant nature of the patients receiving surgery , reports of good outcome are\nsurprisingly high (e.g. depression 34\u201368%; OCD 27\u201367%), although results should be interpreted\ncautiously in view of the obvious lack of any control data. ACAPS and SLL appear better for OCD, and\nACING and SST better for severe mood disorder .\nBox 6.13 Psychosurgery\u2014a historical perspective\nIn 1935, Egas Moniz and Almeida Lima carried out the first \u2018prefrontal leucotomy\u2019 (based on the work\nof Fulton and Jacobsen in bilateral ablation of prefrontal cortices in chimpanzees in 1934). At the time,\nthis was viewed with great enthusiasm (culminating in Moniz being awarded a Nobel Prize for his\nwork in 1949), and other practitioners adapted the early procedures, with Freeman and Watts\nintroducing the standard \u2018prefrontal leucotomy\u2019 (the notorious lobotomy) in 1936, publishing a\nstandard textbook Psychosurgery  in 1942, and Freeman pioneering \u2018transorbital leucotomy\u2019 in 1946.\nThe impact of surgical treatment at a time when there were few other physical treatments should\nnot be underestimated, and around 12,000 procedures were performed between 1936 and 1961 in\nthe UK alone (over 40,000 in the USA). Techniques were refined (e.g. open cingulotomy , bimedial\nleucotomy , orbital undercut) from earlier blind, free-hand procedures. However , the advent of effective\npsychopharmacological treatments and changes in the social climate led to a marked decline in\npractice from the 1960s onwards.\nNowadays, the term \u2018psychosurgery\u2019 has been abandon ed and replaced with the more accurate\n\u2018neurosurgery for mental disorder \u2019. Modern techniques could not be further removed from older\nprocedures and utilize neuroimaging and neurosurgical techniques to lesion clearly defined\nneuroanatomical targets (\n Curren t surgical techniques, see opposite). Between 1984 and 1994,\nthere were a total of only 20 operations per year perform ed in the UK,1 and since then, the number\nhas diminished further . Available data for England and Wales report four procedures in 2015/2016\nand only one in 2016/2017.2 In Scotland, the Dundee Advanced Interventions Service similarly\nreported just four procedures for 2015/2016 and none in 2016/2017.3\n1 CRAG W orking Group (1996) Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder .

Recent research has suggested that the effects\nof phototherapy may be independent of melatonin and produce a \u2018phase advance\u2019 in circadian rhythms\n(hence, treatment may be best given first thing in the morning). It is usually administered by use of a\nlight box (alternatives include light visors) producing 2500\u2013 10,000lx. Treatment duration is for 2hrs (with\n2500lx) or 30min (with 10,000lx) a day, with a course lasting 1\u20133wks (treatment response is usually\nnoticeable within 5 days). If no response within 3wks, discontinue. When effective, continue until time of\nnatural remission to prevent relapse (usually 2\u20135wks). Dawn-stimulating alarm clocks that gradually\nilluminate the bedroom over 2hrs to around 250lx at the point of waking may also be ef fective.\nAdverse effects  Particularly with 10,000lx: headache, visual problems (e.g. eye strain, blurred vision)\n\u2014usually settle ; if persistent, reduce the duration or intensity of exposure; \n  irritabil ity; rarely: manic\nepisodes, \n  thoughts of suicide (possibly due to alerting ef fect and \n  energy).\nIndications  SAD (\n Seasonal affective disorder , p. 273), circadian rhythm disorders (\n Circadian\nrhythm sleep\u2013 wake disorders (CRSD) 1: overview , p. 454), possibly other depressive disorders and\ndysthymia.\nContraindications  Agitation, insomnia, history of hypomania/mania.\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\nCurrently being researched. However , the difference in stimulation parameters used across reported\nstudies makes comparisons difficult. The rationale for treatment is either to increase activity in the left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (using high-frequency stimulation, e.g. 20Hz) or to reduce activity in the\nright dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (using lowfrequency stimulation, e.g. 1Hz). Initial results in treatment-\nresistant depression ought to be viewed with caution (see Cochrane review),32 although this mode of\ntherapy presents an attractive alternative to ECT, without  the accompanying risks and adverse effects.\nThe 2015 NICE recommendations found the evidence of efficacy for repetitive transcranial magnetic\nstimulation (rTMS) to be adequate in the short term and encouraged further research.33\nAdverse effects  Minimal, but patients often report headache or facial discomfort; rarely , seizure\ninduction.\nIndications  Experimental treatment for treatment-resistant depression; possible use in treatment of\ntreatment-resistant auditory hallucinations; negative symptoms of schizophrenia; OCD; panic disorder .\nContraindications  History of stroke, brain tumour , or epilepsy .\nMagneto-convulsive therapy\nAnother experimental treatment that utilizes the potenti al problem of seizure induction by rTMS. A\nvarying magnetic field is used to induce seizures in a more controlled way than is possible with ECT.\nThe potential advantages include targeting of brain struc tures essential for treatment response and a\nreduction in side ef fects (particularly memory impairment).34\nV agus nerve stimulation (VNS)\nVagus stimulation by an implanted pacemaker (first used  as a treatment for epilepsy) has been tested\nas a treatment of depression since 1998. Stimulation is of the left cervical vagus nerve using bipolar\nelectrodes, attached below the cardiac branch (usually 0.5ms pulse-width, at 20\u201330Hz, with 30s\nstimulation periods alternating with 5min breaks). Response rates of 31\u201340% (short-term)35 and 27\u2013\n58% (long-term) have been quoted for treatment-resistant depressive disorder , but the quality of this\nevidence is low and further research is required. NICE recommends special arrangements for clinical\ngovernance, consent, and audit or research.36\nAdverse effects  May include voice alteration (e.g. hoarseness), pain, coughing, and dysphagia."

The variety of presentations make this one of the most\ndifficult conditions to diagnose. More than other psychiatric\ndisorders, the clinician needs to pay attention to the life history of the\npatient and to third-party information from family and friends.\nClassically , periods of prolonged and profound depression\nalternate with periods of excessively elevated and/or irritable mood,\nknown as mania. The sympto ms of mania characteristically include a\n need for sleep, pressured speech, \n  libido, reckless behaviour\nwithout regard  for consequences, and grandiosity (\n Mania/manic\nepisode , p. 320). In severe cases, there may be severe thought\ndisturbances and even psychotic symptoms. Between these highs\nand lows, patients usually experience periods of full remission.\nThis classic presentation appears, however , to be one pole of a\nspectrum of mood disorders (\n Bipolar spectrum disorder , p. 324).\nA milde r form of mania (hypomania), associated with episodes of\ndepression, may also occur (\n Hypomania/hypomanic episode , p.\n322). There is also a subclinical presentation\u2014cyclothymia\u2014in\nwhich an individual may experience oscillating high and low moods,\nwithout ever having a signif icant manic or depressive episode (\nCyclothymia , p. 348). Equally , it may be difficult to distinguish a\nmanic episode with psych otic symptoms from schizoaffective\ndisorder (\n Disorders related to schizophrenia , p. 228) on the basis\nof a single episode.\nFull assessment should consider: the number of previous\nepisodes (whic h may have been subclinical); the averag e length of\nprevious episodes; the avera ge time between episodes; the level of\npsychosocial functioning between episodes; previous responses to\ntreatment (especially treatment of early depressive episodes); family\nhistory of psychiatric problem s; and current (and past) use of alcohol\nand drugs.\nAlthough, at the present time, there is no cure for bipolar disorder ,\nfor most cases, effective treatment is possible and can substantially\ndecrease the associated morbidity and mortality (the suicide rate is"

Although the two men\nwere to continu e arguing about who originated the idea, they at least\nagreed that the illness was characterized by alternating periods of\nmelancholia and mania, often separated by periods of normal mood.\nIn 1899, Emil Kraepelin comprehensively described \u2018manic\u2013\ndepressive insanity\u2019 (MDI) in the sixth edition of his textbook\nPsychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch f\u00fcr Studirende und \u00c4rzte . In the fifth\nedition, he had already divided severe mental illnesses into those\nwith a deteriorating course (i.e. schizophrenia and related\npsychoses) and those with a periodic course (i.e. the mood\ndisorders). It was his view that the mood disorders \u2018represented\nmanifestations of a single morbid process\u2019.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century , hopes were high that\nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of mental illness might be\nwithin reach. In 1906, the German microbiologist August\nWassermann discovered a method of detecting syphilitic infection in\nthe CNS, and in the same year, an effective treatment was\ndeveloped by Paul Ehrlich using arsenic compounds. Syphilis was,\nat that time, one of the most common causes of severe (often mania-\nlike) psychiatric symptoms\u2014GPI. Reliably diagnosing and treating\nsuch a conditio n was a huge step forward. In cases of MDI, however ,\nneuropathologists failed to find any structural brain abnormalities.\nAlthough some  still maintained it was a physical illness, caused by\ndisruptions in biological functioning, the pervasive new\npsychodynamic theories regarded functional illnesses (i.e.\nschizophrenia and MDI) as illnesses of the mind, not the brain. In\n1903, Carl Jung introduced a non-psychotic version of MDI,\ndescribing \u2018a number of cases whose peculiarity consists  in chronic\nhypomanic  behaviour \u2019, with associated episodes of depression and\nmixed mood states, in the context of personal and interpersonal\ndifficulties.\nThe idea that patients could be understood and treated only if the\ntraumatic childhood events, repressed sexual feelings, or\ninterpersonal conflicts were uncovered influenced psychiatric\nthinking for over half a centur y.

In\n1949, John Cade published a report on the use of lithium salts in\nmanic patients, but it took nearly three decades, and the work of\nmany psychiatrists, including Morgens Schou in Denmark and\nRonald Fieve in the USA, before lithium would become the mainstay\nof treatment for MDI. Equa lly significant was the observation by\nRonald Kuhn in 1958 that when patients with \u2018manic\u2013depressive\npsychosis\u2019 were treated with imipramine, they could switch from\ndepression to mania. That this did not occur in all patients with\ndepression suggested that there was a different biological\nmechanism underlying depressive illness, compared to MDI. In\n1957, Karl Leonhard introduc ed the terms \u2018bipolar \u2019 and \u2018unipolar \u2019. In\n1968, both the newly revised classification systems ICD-8 and DSM-\nII acknowledg ed the shift in aetiological view by using the term\n\u2018manic\u2013depressive illness \u2019, but it took another decade before\nLeonhard\u2019 s bipolar/unipolar dichotomy was adopted in the RDC in\nthe 1970s, and ultimately integrated into ICD-9 (1975) and DSM-III\n(1980). This created a very narrow \u2018bipolar disorder \u2019 and reflected a\nturning away from the Kraepelinian MDI concept.\nMuch of the subsequent controversy over \u2018bipolar spectrum\u2019\ndisorders (\n Bipolar spectrum disorder , p. 324) reflected a clinical\nneed to broaden the diagnosis to encompass less severe\npresentations such as type II bipolar disorder (hypomania +\ndepression), which was included in DSM-III-R (1987), ICD-10 (1992),\nand DSM-IV (1994). Cyclothymia and dysthymia were also re-\ncategorized as mood disorders, rather than personality disorders.\nICD-10 recogn ized \u2018mixed affective\u2019 presentations, but it was only in\nDSM-5 (2013) that the symptomology specifier \u2018with mixed features\u2019\ncould be applied to both bipolar I/II and depressive episodes.\nWith the growth of biological research in the 1990s and 2000s, it\nbecame clear that neurotransmitter theories about catec holamines\nhad been overly simplistic.

However , the \u2018illness\u2019 later vanished under\nthe cloak of both pagan and Christian beliefs, with typical symptoms\nattributed to the work of spirits, possession, or divine punishment. It\ndid not resurfa ce properly until the Renaissance (the 1500s) thanks\n(in part) to the witchcraft trials, when doctors were called in to\npresent diagnoses of known illnesses that could be mistaken for\ndemonic possession (the first recorded \u2018medical defence\u2019! ). Although\nthere was much debate, the brain became the final resting place as\nthe organ most likely to be involved in the aetiology of the condition.\nThe history of the neuroses is tightly bound to the (re)discovery of\nhypnosis (formerly the remit  of faith healing).

He also noted that the\nphysiological responses were too slow to account for feelings and\nthat some other \u2018neural mechanism\u2019 must be at work.\nThe dominanc e of the behaviourists in psychology relegated\nemotion to just another \u2018way of acting\u2019 in a particular situation (albeit\ninternally perceived). Although an over-simplification, this led to the\ndevelopment of the \u2018conditioning theory\u2019 of anxiety . John Watson, the\nfather of behaviourism, claim ed to have produced an animal phobia\nin an 11-mth-old boy \u2018little Albert\u2019 by making a loud clanging noise\nwhilst the boy was playing  with a rat. Watson proposed that\nneuroses arose out of traumatic learning situations and then persist\nto influence behaviour throughout life. This was adapted by the\n1930s to include the concept of \u2018instrumental conditioning\u2019\n(association of an emotionally arousing stimulus and a neutral\nresponse), and, in the 1940s, Mowrer attempted to translate Freud\u2019 s\ntheory of anxiety neurosis into the language of learning theory\u2014\nresponses that reduce anxiety are learnt\u2014sometimes these\nreinforced behaviours may be aberrant, unhelpful, or simply bizarre\nand present as neuroses. \u2018Avoidance\u2019 was postulated as the\nbehaviour that was reinforced due to successfully removing a\n\u2018negative reinforcer \u2019 (e.g. fear). These ideas led to the rational\ntreatment of phobias with desensitization techniques.\nIn the search for Cannon\u2019 s neural mechanism, neurophysiologists\nused lesioning  experiments to identify the thalamus as a critical\ngateway for stimuli, and the hypothalamus as mediating the\nphysiological response [via the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal\n(HPA) axis]\u2014the Cannon\u2013Bard theory .

The advent of antid epressants\nartificially sepa rated neurotic  depression from the other neuroses,\nbut nonetheless some utility was also seen in treating the anxiety\ndisorders. A key study was the use of clomipramine in the treatment\nof OCD (see The Boy Who Couldn\u2019t Stop Washing  by Judith\nRapoport, 1989). The fact that clomipramine was the most\nserotonergic of the TCAs paved the way for the second- generation\nantidepressants (the SSRIs) used in neuroses (previously thought\nonly to be amenable to psychological approaches).\nBrain imaging demonstrated underlying functional changes in\nOCD patients [in the frontal cortex (left orbital gyrus) and bilateral\ncaudate nuclei], which \u2018norm alized\u2019 after successful treatment with\nmedication (and interestingly with CBT techniques, although this\ntook longer).

However , it is less common for people\nto experience a clear depressive episode that requires treatment.25\nNormal grief is variable in its intensity and duration.

            "Text": "Introduction\nDisorders of sleep and wakefulness are a somewhat marginalized\nconcern to most psychiatrists , which belies the advances that have\ntaken place in sleep research  in recent decades and their relevance\nto psychiatric training and practice. This is partly due to the fact that\nsleep research  had focused on the physical causes of insomnia,\nsuch as obstru ctive sleep apnoea (OSA) (\n Sleep-related breathing\ndisorders , p. 444)\u2014which is more the remit of respiratory physicians\n\u2014or the neurological presentations, such as narcolep sy\u2014which\nhave yielded interesting genetic and neurobiological findings (\nHypersomnia 2: narcolepsy , p. 450). Having ventured down the cul-\nde-sac of dream/psychosis research in the 1960s and 1970s, few\npsychiatric units in the UK or Ireland still have facilities to conduct\ninpatient sleep  monitoring. As a result, we have to rely on good\nrelations with our physician colleagues in order to appropriately\ninvestigate possible sleep\u2013wake disorders (\n  A brief history of sleep\nresearch , p. 434).\nRelevance to psychiatric practice\nAside from the common-sen se notion that \u2018getting a good night\u2019 s\nsleep\u2019 is good for both physic al and mental health (see Box 10.1), it\nis vital that mental health professionals understand the effects that\nmental disorde r and treatment may have on the normal sleep\u2013wake\ncycle (\n Sleep\u2013wake disorders related to psychiatric disorders 1, p.\n478; \n Sleep\u2013wake disorders related to psychiatric disorders 2, p.\n480; \n Psychiatric medication and sleep , p. 482). Perhaps even\nmore important is the need to recognize that disorders of sleep and\nwakefulness may themselves manifest bizarre and difficult-to-explain\npsychiatric symptoms, such as hypnic hallucinations and REM sleep\nbehaviour , which ought not to be labelled as \u2018psychotic\u2019 in nature (\nParasomnias: overview , p. 458 for cautionary notes). Psychiatrists\nalso should be aware of the principles of good sleep hygiene (\nInsomnia 2: general management strategies , p. 442) and not always\nbe reaching for the prescription pad to sort out sleeping dif ficulties!\nThe International Classification of Sleep Disorders"

Dreams were important to\nmany ancient cultures,2 and an interes t in the nature  of sleep is seen\nin the Greek writings of Alcmaeon (c.500 bc), Aristotle, and\nHippocrates (c.300 bc). Many religious texts and poetic works speak\nof the importance of sleep ing well and the prophetic nature of\ndreams.\nIt was not until the early seventeenth century that scientific\ntheories of sleep re-emerg ed. Descartes espoused a hydraulic\nmodel of sleep, in which the pineal gland played the gatekeeper role\nbetween sleep  and alertness. Thomas Willis, one of the fathers of\nneurology , wrote about sleep, sleepwalking, insomnia, and the\neffects of caffeine in The Practice of Physick  (1692). In 1762,\nAlbrecht von Haller , the father of modern physiology , theorized on\nthe physiology of sleep in his Elementa Physiologiae Corporis\nHumani .\nIn the ninetee nth century , there were four primary theories of\nsleep: vascul ar, chemical, neural, and behavioural. In The\nPhilosophy of Sleep  (1830) , the Scottish physicia n Robert MacNish\nadvocated the Greek idea that congestive blood flow caused sleep;\nhowever , the observations of reduced CBF (in retinal arteries and\ndirect viewing of the brain) during sleep by a number of physicians,\nincluding the German physiologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,\nappeared to contradict the older theories. Aristotelian ideas of sleep-\ninducing, food-related \u2018fumes\u2019 led to chemical theories of substances\naccumulating during wakefulness, inducing sleep.

When Camillo Golgi demonstrated the nerve\ncell in 1873, a variety of different neural theories of sleep arose. In\n1889, the neurologist Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard wrote of\nsleep as an \u2018inhibitory reflex\u2019. The activity of sleep was seen as\nanother type of behaviour , described by the Russian physician Marie\nde Manaceine in 1897 as the \u2018resting state of consciousness\u2019 and\ninvestigated by behaviourists, including Ivan Pavlov .\nInterest in specific disorders of sleep and wakefulness truly began\nwhen, in 1880,  Jean-Baptiste-\u00c9douard G\u00e9lineau described  14 cases\nof hypersomnia , distinguished  primary from secondary hypersomnia,\nand coined the term \u2018narcolepsy\u2019 (Greek: \u2018seized by somnolence\u2019). In\n1902, Loewenfeld noticed a common association between sleep\nattacks and paralysis during bouts of laughter , anger , or other strong\nemotions. This was referred to as \u2018cataplectic  inhibition\u2019 by\nHenneberg in 1916 and later as \u2018cataplexy\u2019 (Greek: \u2018stupefaction\u2019 or\nliterally \u2018strike down\u2019) by Adie in 1926. The term \u2018sleep paralysis\u2019\u2014a\nbrief episodic loss of voluntary movement that occurs on falling\nasleep or awakening\u2014was introduced by Wilson in 1928, although\nMitchell had previously described the phenomenon as \u2018night palsy\u2019\nas early as 1876.\nIn 1903, the work of Cajal and Tello on the morphological changes\nin reptilian brains during hibernation led to a renewed interest in\nneuronal theories of sleep. These culminated in von Economo\u2019 s work\non patients dying from encephalitis lethargicans, following the 1917\nepidemic. The idea that there were centres in the brain that\ncontrolled sleep caught the imagination of neuroscientists, focused\nattention on the hypothalamus, and laid the foundations for further\nneurophysiological and neuropathological research.\nIn 1924, Berger succeeded  in recording the first human EEG.\nFilled with doubt, it took him 5yrs to publish his first paper in 1929,\nbut he was the first to show that cerebral electrical activity was\ndifferent during sleep than arousal. It took some time for the EEG to\nbe accepted, but, in 1937, Loomis documented the slow-wave EEG\npatterns of non-REM (NREM) sleep [slow-wave sleep (SWS)]. The\nmajor breakthrough came in 1949 when Moruzzi and Magoun first\ninvestigated the neural components regulating the brain\u2019s sleep\u2013"

With his student, Dement,\nKleitman also described the \u2018typical\u2019 architecture of sleep in 1957.\nDement went on to show that REM sleep was characterized by a\ncharacteristic desynchronized, \u2018active\u2019 pattern, a finding confirmed by\nJouvet in 1959.

Narcolepsy seriously impacts on education, work,\nrelationships, the ability to drive, and recreational activitie s, and can\nhave negative ef fects on self-esteem and mood.\nPrevalence  The most common neurological cause of\nhypersomnia; estimated prevalence 0.20\u20130.40 per 1000 in the\ngeneral population. \u2642:\u2640 = 1.64:1.

More often, a cataplectic attack will be partial,\ne.g. involving jaw muscles (difficulty with articulation), facial\nmuscles (grimacing), or thigh muscles (brief unlocking of the\nknees).

In\nfact, it was the first epilepsy in which a genetic basis was detected.\nThe genetic form is heterogenous with autosomal dominant\ninheritance (ADNFLE). The most frequent (~12%) mutatio ns involve\ngenes coding for subunits of the heteromeric neuronal nicotinic\nAChRs (nAChRs), and the most frequent aetiology of symptomatic\nforms is type II focal cortical dysplasia. NFLE usually presents before\n20yrs with different types of seizures: (1) brief stereotyped\nmovements of the limbs, axial musculature, or head; (2) paroxysmal\narousals that are sudden and brief (5\u201310s), sometimes accompanied\nby stere otyped movements, vocalizations, frightened expression, or\nfear; and (3) major attacks, (lasting 20\u201330s) with tonic or dystonic\nposturing, or complex movements such as pelvic thrusting, pedalling,\nor more violent movements of limbs. Nocturnal PSG with audiovisual\nrecording is often normal, and when the diagnosis is unclear ,\nsphenoidal electrode recording can be helpful.\nManagement\nTreatment of sleep-related epilepsy involves anticonvulsant drugs,\nBDZs, high-dose steroids, and, for resistant cases, neurosurgery .\nOther sleep disorders that may worsen epilepsy (e.g. OSA or\ninsomnia) should be adequately treated to improve seizure\nfrequency .

In\nrecent years, there has been a significant shift in how this group of\npeople are conceptualized within the medical profession and in wider\nsociety . They are now accepted as displaying a normal variant of\ngender identity , rather than a disorder . Transgender people usually\ncome to psychiatric attentio n, not with a wish to change these\nfeelings, but rather seeking onward referral to specialist services for\nassessment and management of gender reassignment.\nGender specialists are often psychiatrists but may be chartered\npsychologists or medical practitioners from other specialties with\nspecific experience in the assessment and management of people\nwith gender dysphoria. Most treatment is provided by gender identity\nclinics, with input from a range of specialists, including surgeons,\nendocrinologists, sexual health physicians, speech and language\ntherapists, psychologists, and counsellors. The aim is to make an\naccurate diagnosis, to assess and treat comorbidity , and to provide\nsupport through the period of assessment and transition. Ongoing\ncare is increasingly provided  in primary care, with specialist advice\nas needed.\nCultural context\nThe terms gender non-c onformity , gender variance, gender\nincongruence, or transgender are attempts to describe individuals for\nwhom gender identity does not match the identity usually identified\nwith the sexual anatomy at birth.

There is tension regarding the role of\npsychiatry and medicine in the lives of people who are transgender .\nLike the historical inclusion of homosexuality in the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the application of a medica l\ndiagnosis (such as \u2018Gender identity disorder \u2019 or \u2018Transsexualism\u2019) to\ntransgender individuals is felt by some to ascribe pathology to a\nnormal variant of human experience.\nEvidence for the separation between gender identity and natal sex\nis found across cultures. Anthropological and historical studies\ndescribing gender identities that do not conform with rigid biological\nboundaries are numerous. It is important to note that cultural\nrecognition of communities, categories, and roles for people who\nhave minority gender identity does not prevent marg inalization,\ndiscrimination, violence, or social control.

PD are enduring (starting in childhood or adolescence\nand continuing into adulthood), persistent, and pervasive disorders\nof inner experience and behaviour that cause distress or significant\nimpairment in social functioning. PD manifests as problems in\ncognition  (ways of perceiving and thinking about self and others),\naffect  (range, intensity , and appropriateness of emotional response),\nand behaviour  (interp ersonal functioning, occupational and social\nfunctioning, and impulse control). To diagnose PD, the manifest\nabnormalities should not be due to other conditions (such as\npsychosis, affective disorder , substance misuse, or organic disorder)\nand should be out of keeping with social and cultural norms.\nDevelopment of the concept\nThe development of clinical concepts of conditions which would\ntoday be recog nized as PD started in the early nineteenth century , at\na time when the main two groups of mental conditions acknowledged\nby psychiatrist s were insanity and idiocy . It became clear that there\nwere individuals who were neither insane (i.e. suffering from\ndelusions or hallucinations) nor clearly idiots, imbeciles, or morons\n(to use the then contemp orary terminology for ID), but who\nnevertheless had abnormalities in their behaviour .\nIn 1801, Pinel described non-psychotic patients with disturbed\nbehaviour and thinking as \u2018manie sans d\u00e9lire \u2019, while the term \u2018moral\ninsanity\u2019 was introduced by Prichard in 1835. \u2018Moral\u2019 then meant\n\u2018psychological\u2019 (rather than the modern meaning concern ing ethics),\nand among the patients described were people who had affective\ndisorders, as well as people who were personality-disordered.

It was inspired by the \u2018social psychiatry\u2019 movement and its growing emphasis on the care and\nwelfare of vulnerable sectors of the population.\nPsychiatric illnesses in older people include:\n\u2022Pre-existing psychiatric disorders in the ageing patient.\n\u2022New disorders  due to specif ic stresses and circumstances of old age (e.g. bereavement, infirmity ,\ndependence, sensory deficits, isolation).\n\u2022Disorders due to the changing physiology of the ageing brain.\n\u2022Psychiatric complications of neurological and systemic illnesses [e.g. delirium (\n Acute confusional\nstate (delirium) , p. 854) is particularly recognized as a common complication of a variety of physical\nhealth problem s in the elderly and needs to be consider ed in any patient where there has been an\nunexplained change in their cognitive functioning or level of awareness].\nPsychiatric problems often coexist with physical problems, and treatment strategies need to take\naccount of this (as well as the different pharmacokinetics of the older patient; \n  Psychopharmacology in\nthe elderly , p. 558). Furthermore, the elderly are more likely to manifest physical symptoms of\npsychiatric disorders than younger adults. Cognitive assessment and physical examination are always\nessential parts of psychiatric management of the older person. Dementia is generally the main focus of\ninterest in old age psychiatry , but the discipline also involves the treatment of general psychiatric\nillnesses in older adults.\nSince older people are often dependent on others, consideration of the role and needs of carers are\nimportant aspects of holistic  care. Psychiatric care of the elderly is inherently multidisciplinary and\ninterfaces with multiple services, both state and independent (e.g. social services, housing and welfare\nservices, the legal system, charity organizations, and religious institutions).\nThe demographics of old age\nIn developed countries, such as the UK, the elderly population has been increasing steadily over the last\ncentury . For example, in the UK, the percentage of the population older than 65yrs was 5% in 1900 and\n15% in 2003, and is projec ted to rise from 18% in 2016 to 23.8% in 2036.1 This trend is largely\nattributed to the decline in infant mortality , control of infectious diseases, and improvement in sanitation,\nliving standards, and nutrition , as well as a declining birth rate. The implications of increasing numbers\nof elderly people in society are many , including a drop in the proportion of the working population, an\nincrease in overall disability and health needs, and a corresponding increase in the need for both health\nand social services."

For example , 5% of people older than 65yrs suffer from moderate to severe dementia\nand the prevalence increases  to over 30% in those over 85yrs. A recent survey in England showed the\nprevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders to be 10.2% in those aged 65\u201374yrs and 8.1% in\nthose aged 75yrs and over .2\nOther research  has shown a particularly high prevalence of mental disorder among elderly people in\nsheltered acco mmodation. Of the 80,000 people in the UK who die in care homes annually , up to two-\nthirds have some form of dementia. Up to two-thirds of patients >65yrs in general hospital wards have a\npsychiatric disorder; of these, 20% may suffer from delirium, 31% from dementia, and 29% from\ndepression at any one time.3 Finally, it is regrettably also the case that psychiatric disorders are\ncommonly either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed at prima ry care level. Having said this, research has\ndemonstrated a marked improvement over the last decade in both diagnosis and management at this\nlevel.\nThe role of the old age psychiatrist\n\u2022Advocate  The old age psychiatrist can be an active proponent of the interests of the elderly , e.g.\nsourcing funding, providing education to the public, dispelling the stigma of ageing.\n\u2022Teacher  An old age psychiatrist is well placed to provide education in both medical and non-medical\ncontexts. Medical and nursing students, across-discipline specialists and trainees, school pupils,\ncommunity forums, and service organizers may all benefit from their expertise.\n\u2022Health educationalist/promoter  Holistic care of the elder ly includes both health education and\npreventative intervention.\n\u2022Student  Old age psychiatry is a major area of research, and the changing demography of ageing\nallows for academic collaboration with other disciplines, e.g. sociology , history , and human geography .\n\u2022Innovator  Individuals working in this area have had the opportunit y to be creative and innovative in\ndeveloping appropriate services.\n\u2022Team player  Old age psychiatry is a truly multidisciplinary discipline.\n\u2022\u2018Missionary\u2019  The global challenges for the twenty-first century include expanding the discipline within\ndeveloping countries, as well as finding new strategies for caring for the growing numbers of elderly\npeople within the first world.4\nNormal ageing\nNeurobiology of ageing5\n\u2022The weight  of the brain decreases by 5% between 30 and 70yrs, by 10% by the age of 80, and by\n20% by the age of 90. There is a proportionate increase in ventricular size and the size of the\nsubarachnoid space .\n\u2022MRI shows  changes in grey and white matter and a reduction in volume prominent in the\nhippocampus, association cortices, and cerebellum.\n\u2022Cortical blood flow  in the frontal and temporal lobes and thalamus decreases with age.\n\u2022There is some  nerve cell loss in the cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and Purkin je cells of the\ncerebellum, but less than was thought previously , and reductions in dendrites and synapses are\nthought to be more important. The cytoplasm of nerve cells accumulates a pigment (lipofuscin ), while\nthere are also changes in the components of the cytoskeleton.\n\u2022Tau protein  (links neurofilaments and microtubules) can accumulate to form NFTs in some nerve cells.\nIn normal ageing, NFT s are usually confined to cells of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.\n\u2022Senile plaques  (extracellular amyloid and neuritic processes) are found in the normal ageing brain in\nthe neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.\n\u2022Lewy bodies  (intracellular inclusions) occu r normally and are confined to the substantia nigra and the\nlocus caeruleus.\n\u2022Hirano bodies  occur in new hippocampal pyramidal cells.\n\u2022Amyloid deposits  (\u03b2-amyloid and A4 amyloid) may be widespread in superficial cortical and\nleptomeningeal vessels, as well as patchy within the cortex.\nPsychology of ageing\n\u2022Cognitive assessment  is often complicated by physical illness or sensory deficits."

This implies that individual assessment, management, and follow-up require\ncollaboration between health , social, and voluntary organizations and family carers. Assessment of the\nolder patient with mental illness includes:\n\u2022Full history from the patient, family , and carers.\n\u2022Full physical and neurological examination.\n\u2022MSE, including thorough cognitive assessment.\n\u2022Functional assessment (evaluation of the ability to perform functions of everyday living).\n\u2022Social assessment [accommodation; need for care; financ ial and legal issues, especially driving status\nand power of attorney (PoA) (\n  Power of attorney , p. 562); social activities].\n\u2022Assessment of carers\u2019 needs.\nThe best place for performing an assessment is in the patient\u2019 s home. A home visit has the advantage\nof being more convenient and relaxing for the patient, and it provides the health carer with an\nopportunity to assess living conditions, social activities, and medications kept in the house. In addition,\nfamily members, neighbours, and carers may be available for interviewing. Historically , day hospital\nwould have then been involved in more complex cases, but this now tends to be replaced by Intensive\nHome Assessment and Treatment teams that can also lead to admission being avoided in some cases.\nSometimes a brief admission is indicated, especially if the elderly person has pressing physical or\npsychiatric needs or if suppo rt is unavailable (or respite is desperately needed). A full assessment will\nrequire multidisciplinary input and may involve doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists,\nsocial workers, voluntary workers, legal professionals, and others involved with the elderly .\nIn obtai ning a thorough histor y, it is important to allow the patient to tell their own story . One needs to\nenquire about the presenting problem and how it has evolved, whether it is a new or long-standing\nproblem, and whether the individual has a personal or family history of mental problems.

However , the\nindividual facto rs that contribute to aetiology , clinical presentation, and management strategy differ due\nto the specific biopsychosocial conditions of old age. In order to grasp a full understanding of elderly\npsychopathology , it is necess ary to appreciate the physiological, psychological, and sociocultural factors\nunique to this age group. Disorders in the elderly may present with some \u2018classic\u2019 symptoms (common\nto adult psychopathology), but very often their clinical manifestation varies significantly due to the\nunique conditions of old age. The following pages focus on the \u2018unique\u2019 features of psychiatric illnesses\nin the elderly .\nNeuroses\nPrevalence  Depression and anxiety are common in old age. There is no decline in their prevalence with\nadvancing age, but of concern is the fact that there is a reduction in referrals to psychiatry . This may be\ndue to \n acceptance of symptoms by the elderly or due to deficiencies in detection by health\nprofessionals. The estimated prevalence of neurotic disorders is 1\u201310%, with a \u2640 predominance and\nroughly equal frequency of \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 cases.\nClinical features  Non-specific anxiety and depressive symptoms predominate, and hypochondriacal\nsymptoms are often prominent. Obsessional, phobic, dissociative, and conversion disorders are less\ncommon. Factors such as physical ill health, immobility , and lack of social support may give rise to fear\nand a lack of confidence about going out of the home.\nAetiology  Multiple factors may contribute to new neurotic symptoms in the elderly . Among these, the\nmost common  are: major life events, physical illness, feelings of loneliness, impaired self-care, and\n\u2018insecure\u2019 personality style.\nDifferential diagnosis  Physical illness; acute or chronic organic brain disease; af fective disorders.\nManagement\n\u2022The mainstay of treatment is to identify and manage aetiological factors. This obviously very often\ncalls for social interventions, and thus a multidisciplinary approach is essential."

Caution needs to be\nobserved when  considering changing/reducing/stopping long-term antipsychotics in this group, as this\nnot uncommonly may precipitate a relapse, even in persons who have been stable for years. It is\nadvisable that the patient has a psychiatric review and opinion in this regard.\nNew psychosis\nThe terminolog y used to describe psychosis in older adults has varied throughout the twentieth and\nearly twenty-first centuries. Historically , the term \u2018late paraphrenia\u2019 was often used to describe psychosis\nin the elderly , after the observation by Roth and Morrissey in 1952 that there were clinical similarities\nbetween paraphrenia (as originally described by Kraepe lin in 1909) and the most common forms of\npsychosis in those aged >60yrs. The usefulness of the term has since come into question, and an\ninternational consensus has suggested that the terms late-onset schizophrenia (for onset between 40\nand 60yrs) and very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (for onset >60yrs) are more useful for\ndescribing psychosis in older adults and for guiding resea rch in this area.9 These terms recognize that\nschizophrenia is heterogenous but emphasize that there are more clinical similarities between early- and\nlate-onset schizophrenia than there are differences. At present, neither ICD-10 nor DSM-5 (nor ICD-1 1)\nhave age-specific cut-of fs in their diagnostic classifications of psychotic disorders."

Mania accounts for\n5\u201310% of mood disorders in the elderly .\nAetiology\nA positive family history becomes less relevant in older-onset mood disorder . Physical illnesses are\nassociated in 60\u201375% of cases. Major life events are common, as is the lack of a confiding and\nsupportive relationship. Older patients are less likely to complain, as losses are \u2018expected\u2019.\nNeuroimaging yields conflicting results, and brain chan ges noted may relate to the normal ageing\nprocess. The strongest imaging evidence for brain changes is for mania in men.\nClinical features\nThere are no clear distinctions between the clinical presentation of depression in the elderly and that in\nyounger people. However , some symptoms are often more striking:\n\u2022Severe psychomotor retardation or agitation occurs in up to 30% of depressed elderly patients.\n\u2022A degree of cognitive impairment has been detected in 70% (especially with ef fortful tasks).\n\u2022Depressive delusions regard ing poverty , physical illness , or nihilistic in nature are common (e.g.\nCotard\u2019 s syndrome; \n  Dictionary of psychiatric symptoms , p. 105).\n\u2022Paranoia is also common, while derogatory and obscene auditory hallucinations may occur .\n\u2022Classic symptoms may not even be evident, and the patient may instead present with somatic,\nanxiety , or hypochondriacal complaints. A high index of suspicion is required when older patients\npresent with these symptoms, especially abnormal illness behaviour .\nPseudodementia\nA mino rity of retarded, depressed elderly present with \u2018pseudodementia\u2019 (i.e. marked difficulties with\nconcentration and memory). Features suggestive of pseudodementia include: previous history of\ndepression; depressed mood; biological symptoms; \u2018island s of normality\u2019; exaggerated symptoms; poor\neffort on testing, frequent comments such as \u2018I can\u2019t be bothered\u2019, \u2018it\u2019s too difficult\u2019 to relatively easy\ntasks; and response to antidepressant medication. For some, this may herald/uncover the onset of a\ndementia syndrome, and there is a proven association between depressive pseudodementia and a later\ndiagnosis of dementia.\nMania or hypomania\nPresent similar ly as in younger patients; however , they are more often followed by a depressive episode\nin older patients. There is usually a history of bipolar affective disorder . A first episode of mania in an\nelderly person requires careful screening for cerebral or systemic pathology (e.g. stroke or\nhyperthyroidism).\nDifferential diagnosis\nDementia \u2014difficult to distinguish and can occur together; if in doubt, best to treat; paranoid disorder \u2014\ndepressive paranoia and delusions may be difficult to distinguish from psychoses; stroke \u2014especially\nafter left frontal cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or secondary to lability , reactive stress, organic apathy , \n motivation, or drug side effects associated with stroke; Parkinson\u2019 s disease \u2014drug side effects in\ntreating may suggest depre ssive illness; other physical disorders , e.g. infection, hypothyroidism,\ntumours, alcohol, drug side ef fects. Note:  full physical investigation is vital.\nManagement\n\u2022Antidepressants  First-lin e is SSRIs due to \n side effects and relative safety in OD. TCAs are not\nabsolutely contraindicated in the elderly , but care must be exercised in prescribing. ECG and BP\nmonitoring is important due to postural drops, as well as other cardiac problems. Others include:\nSNRIs such as venlafaxine; and occasionally moclobemide (delayed hypotension a problem). General\nrules include: low starting dose, gradual increases, and longer maintenance periods (up to 2yrs);\nbeware of suicide risk; consider lithium augmentation. Caution needs to be observed when\nconsidering changing/reducing/stopping long-term antid epressants in this group, as this may\nprecipitate a relapse, even in persons who have been stable for years.\n\u2022ECT (\n ECT 2: indications, contrain dications, and considerations , p. 296) First-line treatment for\nsevere illness and specifically where there is marked agitation, life-threatening stupor , suicidality , or\ncontraindications, failure, or excessive side effects of drugs. ECT is generally safe and effective."

Post-ECT confusion may be a problem, in which case treatments\nshould be given at longer intervals.\n\u2022Psychological treatments  Therapies include: CBT for depression; supportive psychotherapy; and\nbereavement counselling.\n\u2022Treatment of mania  Age-appropria te doses of antipsychotics may be used, in particular haloperidol\nand risperidone. Lithium is first line in prophylaxis, but lower dosages are indicated (levels: 0.4\u2013\n0.8mmol/L) and regular thyroid and renal checks (at least 3-monthly) are essential. Also note that\nlevels may easily change in the presence of infection, dehydration, and use of other medications (e.g.\ndiuretics). Levels should be taken at 10\u201314hrs after the last lithium dose. Following an increase in\nlithium dose, 5\u20137 days should be allowed for serum levels to stabilize.\nPrognosis\nGenerally , prognosis is good, especially if: onset <70yrs; short illness; good previous adjustment; absent\nphysical illness; and good previous recovery . Poor outcome is associated with: severity of initial illness;\npsychotic symp toms; physica l illness; poor medication compliance; and severe life events during follow-\nup period.\nOther mental health problems in the elderly\nAlcohol problems\nWith decreasing tolerance for alcohol in advancing age, there is a corresponding increase in the risk of\nintoxication and adverse effects. Risk factors for late onset of alcohol problems include: \u2640 gender;\nhigher socio-e conomic class; physical ill-health; precip itating life events; neurotic personality; and\npsychiatric illness.\nPrinciples of management\n\u2022Prognosis is good if alcohol problems commence secondary to practical problems.\n\u2022Encourage and facilitate involvement in non-drinking social activities.\n\u2022In extreme cases, consider the need for supervision of finances.\n\u2022Orientate towards reducing physical problems.\n\u2022Moving to residential care may reduce social isolation.\nCaution must be displayed when detoxing the elderly from alcohol with BDZs. There may be comorbid\ncognitive impa irment, which makes the patient more susceptible to BDZs, precipitated deliriums\n(secondary to use of too high doses), rather than alcohol withdrawal delirium, and this should always be\nconsidered in the dif ferential diagnosis of elderly persons with a non-resolving delirium in this context.\nDrug abuse\nGenerally , illicit substance abuse is not a significant problem in the elderly , although with changing\ndemographics, this may increasingly become a problem. However , misuse of prescription drugs\n(especially BDZs, opiates, and analgesics) frequently becomes a problem in this age group.\nDependence on such medications may result from careless prescription of long-term treatments for\ncommon probl ems of ageing such as insomnia and arthritis. With the best of intentions, doctors may\nbelieve that it is \u2018cruel\u2019 to withdraw patients from these medications, especially if the patient has been\nusing the drug for years and is advanced in age. Underlying this belief is the common clinically\nevidenced precipitation of difficult-to-treat anxiety . However , it is important to consider whether\nwithdrawal may actually enhance quality of life by diminishing chronic side ef fects such as depression.\nSexual problems\nFactors influen cing the sexual life of younger adults are relevant to older people too (e.g. social\nstresses, illness, and side effects of medications). In addition, the elderly may experience added\nproblems related to the specific physiological changes that accompany ageing. Dementia sufferers may\nbecome sexua lly demanding  as part of the disinhibition  that frequently characterizes this disorder .\nHealth carers may fail to detect sexual problems experienced by older people, as a sexual history is\ncommonly overlooked. This may result from incorrect assumptions that carers often make regarding\nsexuality in this age group. The patient themselves may assume that his or her sexual dysfunction  is a\n\u2018normal\u2019 aspect of ageing. Some practical remedies are: HRT; vaginal lubricants and topical oestrogen;\nand, of course, sildenafil (V iagra\u00ae)."

Paranoid traits may intensify , especially when there is\nincreasing social isolation. In some cases, this may be mistaken for a paranoid psychotic state such as\ndelusional disorder .

Both organic and functional brain disorders may manifest as \u2018a change in personality\u2019.\nPersonality problems are often the cause of Diogenes syndrome \u2014also called senile squalor syndrome\n\u2014in which individuals become increasingly isolated and neglect themselves, living in filthy, poor\nconditions. They are often oblivious to their condition and resistant to help, necessitating intervention (\nHoarding disorder (DSM-5) , p. 389).\nSuicide\nOld age is a risk factor for suicide, and it is estimated that ~20% of all suicides are of the elderly . There\nis a \u2642 predominance of 2:1 in this age group, as suicide  rates tend to increase with age in men and\ndecrease with age in women. The rate of elderly suicides declined markedly during the 1960s, due to\ndetoxification of the mains gas supply .

Gender\ndistribution is roughly equal.  Apparent self-harm in this age group is much more likely to be a failed\nsuicide and thus should be taken very seriously . It is important to exclude depression and also PD, as\n90% have a depressive illness. Also 60% are physically ill; 50% have been previously admitted to a\npsychiatric hospital, and 8% go on to complete a suicide within 3yrs.\nIssues of elder abuse\nIn recent decades, the unfort unate problem of elder abuse has become increasingly recognized.14,15 It\nis often overlooked and requires an integrated respon se from multiple disciplines and agencies,\nincluding health and social services, the criminal justice system, and the government. The need for a\nunified multidis ciplinary appro ach cannot be emphasized enough, as a fragmented response is fraught\nwith problems.\nT ypes of elder abuse\nElder abuse is an all-inclusive term representing all types of mistreatment or abusive behaviour towards\nolder adults. This mistreatment can be an act of commission (abuse) or omission (neglect), intentional or\nunintentional, and of one or more types:\n\u2022Physical, sexual, verbal, or psychological abuse.\n\u2022Physical or psychological neglect.\n\u2022Financial exploitation.\nThe abuse or neglect results in unnecessary suffering, injury , pain, or loss and leads to a violation of\nhuman rights and a decrease in the quality of life.\nEpidemiology of elder abuse\nOccurs in both domestic and institutional settings:"

            "Text": "\u2022Domestic settings  ~4\u20136% of elderly people report incidents of abuse or neglect in domestic settings.\nThe most common forms of abuse are verbal abuse and financial exploitation by family members and\nphysical abuse by spouses. Gender distribution (of victims ) is equal, and economic status and age are\nunrelated to the risk of abus e. Importantly , elder abuse is under-reported\u2014450,000 older adults in\ndomestic settin gs were abused, neglected, or exploited in the USA during 1996, of whom only 70,000\nself-reported.\n\u2022Institutional settings  No data exist for the extent of abuse within institutional settings. However , one\nsurvey of nursing home staff in a US state disclosed that 36% of staff had witnessed at least one\nincident of physical abuse in the preceding year, while 10% admitted to having committed at least one\nact of physical abuse themselves.\nExplaining elder abuse\nThe main risk factors for elder abuse are: dependency and social isolation of the victim; the carer has\nmental or substance misuse problems; and absence of a suitable guardian. Factors vary according to\nthe type of abuse; for exam ple, dependency is a risk factor for financial or emotional abuse, but not\nnecessarily for physical abuse . Also the causes of spouse abuse may differ from the causes of abuse by\nadult of fspring.\nAn integrative response to elder abuse\nPrevention is the best approa ch, and a number of measures have proved effective: training and support\nof carers, reducing isolation of elders, respite care, CPN visits, etc. Responding to abuse effectively\nrequires a multidisciplinary approach and a proactive system of assessment of suspicious cases (a\nnumber of assessment instruments have been develop ed).16,17 There may now also be legislation\navailable to allow assessment and intervention, e.g. the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act\n2007. Assessment will necessitate capacity evaluation (\n Capacity and consent , p. 856), which may\nreframe the legal context of the alleged abuse and serve to preserve and promote the dignity and\nindependence of older adults.18\nPsychopharmacology in the elderly\nGeneral considerations\nOlder people often have a number of physical health problems, for which they may need multiple\nmedications (a phenomenon referred to as \u2018polypharmacy\u2019).19,20 As the numbe r of medications rises, so\ntoo do the risks of side effects and drug interactions. Many of the drugs used to treat psychiatric illness\nhave significant side effects, particularly cardiac, metabolic, and extra-pyramidal. Older patients are\nmore prone to experience side effects due to changes in how the body handles drugs (\nPharmacokinetics, see below), and therefore, the side effects of any medication need to be weighed\ncarefully again st any potential benefits. Because of this, a careful and considered approach should be\ntaken when prescribing for older patients, and a patient\u2019 s medications should be reviewed frequently .\nCertain medic ations will require structured ongoing monitoring of blood tests and physical health\nparameters (particularly lithium, clozapine, and antipsychotics), but all those who prescribe for the\nelderly need to be cognizant of their patients\u2019 wider physical health.\nPharmacokinetics\nThe physiological changes associated with ageing mean that the older patient\u2019 s system handles drugs\nquite dif ferently from that of a younger individual.\n\u2022Absorption  There are reductions in gastric pH, mesenteric blood flow, and gut motility , resulting in a\nreduced rate of absorption.\n\u2022Distribution of drugs  This is also altered. Reduced body mass (but with proportionally \n  body fat),\nreduced body water , and lower albumin can cause \n  levels of free drug and longer half-lives,\nespecially of psychoactive drugs.\n\u2022Drug metabolism  This is reduc ed due to \n blood flow to the liver and loss of efficiency of liver\nmicrosomes.\n\u2022Excretion  This is reduced with the natural drop in renal clearance that accompanies old age. Thus\ndrug effects are generally prolonged and cumulative, and the risk of toxicity is high. This is particularly\nimportant in patients on lithium, which is solely excreted by the kidneys without any preceding\nbiotransformation."

In principle though, the ideal service should plan to:\n\u2022Maintain the elderly person at home for as long as possible.\n\u2022Respond quickly to medical and social problems as they arise.\n\u2022Ensure coordination of the work of those providing continuing care.\n\u2022Support relatives and others who care for the elderly at home.\n\u2022Promote liaison between medical, social, and voluntary services.\nPrimary care services  At the primary care level, GPs, health visitors, commun ity nurses, and health\nworkers will deal with most of the problems of elderly people.\nAcute and long-term hospital services  Elderly patients often require admission for acute\nassessment and treatment, respite care, or long-term care. Services may be situated within general\nmedical wards for the elderly or within specialized old age psychiatry units. The advantage of acute\nservices being  located in general hospitals, rather than psychiatric hospitals, is that a range of\nassociated specialist services (such as old age medicine, neurology , and radiology) are often more\nreadily available.\nDay and outpatient care Ideally, a service should have outpatient facilities for the assessment,\ntreatment, and follow-up of mobile elderly patients with mental health problems. Sometimes these clinics\noffer a speciali st service such as the \u2018Memory Clinic\u2019. Day-care services may take the form of a general\nor psychiatric day hospital, and local authorities often provide day centres and social clubs for functional\nand social support.\nCommunity psychiatric nurses  CPNs provid e a vital link between primary care and specialist\nservices. They often perform assessments on patients after receiving a referral from a GP. They also\nmonitor treatment in collaboration with GPs and the psychiatric services. In addition, they take part in\nthe organization of home support for elderly patients with dementia.\nInformal carers  These are the unpaid relatives, neighbours, or friends who care for the elderly\nperson at home.

Relievin g carer burden is a challenge for any service.\nActive involvement of medical and social personnel, as well as provision of education and respite, are\nimportant aspects of carer support.\nDomiciliary services  These include: home helps; meals at home; laundry and shopping services;\nand emergency call systems. In some countries such as the UK, local authorities provide these services;\nhowever , in many others, these services are either privately engaged, obtained from voluntary\norganizations, or unavailable.\nV oluntary organizations  Increa singly , there are a range of voluntary and charitable organizations\nwith the aim of helping the elderly , particularly those with dementia. In the UK, organizations like the\nAlzheimer \u2019s Society may be involved in providing support in the post-diagnosis period. Local mental\nhealth charities may run a variety of reminiscence groups for those with dementia, often around a\nparticular area of interest such as football or music.21 Increasingly , public institutions, such as art\ngalleries, concert halls, and cinemas, may have specific \u2018dementia-friendly\u2019 events. For many patients,\nchurches and other faith communities are an important source of support and identity throughout their\nlife. Particularly for elderly patients, these can provide a much needed point of connection and a sense\nof community during a period of life often marked by fragmentation and loss.\nResidential an d nursing care In most countr ies, the local authorities take responsibility for providing\nold people\u2019s homes and other sheltered accommodation. These range in standard, from large, crowded\ninstitutions to small, indepe ndent units, and, ideally they need to balance individual privacy with\ninvolvement in outside activities. In many communities , private homes are available, but financial\nconstraints put these out of the reach of the majority of older people.

Contemporary palliative services stress the following\ncomponents in providing a \u2018good death\u2019:\n\u2022A multidisciplinary approach.\n\u2022Ability to \u2018diagnose dying\u2019.\n\u2022Communication with the patient and family .\n\u2022Provision of adequate physical support (e.g. analgesia, hydration).\n\u2022Minimize unnecessary interventions.\n\u2022Establish a non-resuscitation plan.\n\u2022Psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual support.\nPower of attorney\nAn LPA (in England and Wales; \n  Lasting powers of attorney (LPA), p. 942) or enduring power of\nattorney (EPA) (in Scotland; \n  Power s of attorney , p. 945) is a legal procedure in which a person\nnominates someone to make decisions on their behalf in the event that they become unable to do so\nthemselves. Broadly , each allows a person to nominate one or more trusted individuals (often family ,\nfriends, or a solicitor) to make decisions on their behalf and to specify what powers these individuals\nhave. A PoA may give the appointed person power to make decisions about finances and property or\nabout health and personal welfare, or both. Different powers may be appointed to different attorneys\n(e.g. a person might give their family PoA over their welfare and their solicitor PoA over their finances).\nAn LPA or EPA is signed in advance of an individual losing capacity and only comes into action when\ncapacity is lost. It is important as an old age psychiatrist to know whether an incapacitated patient has a\nPoA in place, so that you can involve the appropriate individuals in any decision-making relating to their\ncare. Further information about PoA in the UK can be found on the website of the Office of the Public\nGuardian for the appropriate devolved nation (or the Of fice of Care and Protection in Northern Ireland)."

            "Text": "Advance directives\nAn adva nce directive, also referred to as a living will or an anticipatory care plan, is an instruction made\nby an individual (usually written and witnessed) stating their preferences for future treatment during a\nterminal illness . Usually the person specifies the degree  of irreversible deterioration after which they\nwant no furthe r life-sustaining  treatment. Often the statement will outline the patient\u2019 s refusal  of certain\nmedical interventions in particular circumstances. If a health professional is asked to assist someone in\ndrawing up an advance directive, the following issues should be considered:\n\u2022The patient should be fully informed about the illness and treatment options.\n\u2022The patient should be mentally competent.\n\u2022The patient should be reflecting his/her own views, free from influence.\nThe Mental Capacity Act 2005 (covering England and Wales) allows for \u2018advance decisions\u2019 (\nMental Capacity Act: England and W ales, p. 942) in case of future incapacity .\nIf a patient lacks capacity , and information about a written or verbal advance refusal of treatment is\nrecorded in their notes or is otherwise brought to your attention, you must bear in mind that valid and\napplicable advance refusals must be respected, althoug h basic care (i.e. analgesia, catheter , fluids)\nshould be provided in all cases. A valid advance refusal that is clearly applicable to the patient\u2019 s present\ncircumstances will be legally binding in England and Wales (unless it relates to life-prolonging treatment,\nin which case further legal criteria must be met).23 Valid and applicable advanc e refusals are potentially\nbinding in Scotland and Northern Ireland, although this has not yet been tested in court. The code of\npractice of the Scottish legislation states that all practitioners have an \u2018unqualified obligation\u2019 to \u2018take\naccount of the present and past wishes and feelings of the adult in so far they can be ascertained\u2019, but\ncaution that an advance statement, while potentially legally binding, \u2018should not be viewed in isolation\nfrom the surro unding circum stances\u2019.24 The BMA Ethics Departmen t has its own code of practice on\nthese issues.25\nW ithdrawal of treatment26 , 27\nThe active or passive involvement of a carer in hastening an individual\u2019 s death is highly controversial\nand morally complex. Dif fering degrees of involvement should be distinguished:\n\u2022Withdrawal of active interven tions, such as medications and blood transfusion, is an accepted aspect\nof palliative care and draws little debate.\n\u2022Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment such as fluids and food. This is equivalent to \u2018allowing a patient\nto die\u2019. Since the current emphasis is on preserving human dignity , rather than preserving life, this is\nmorally acceptable for many and should not be considered euthanasia.\n\u2022Active intervention which hastens or precipitates the patient\u2019 s death\u2014euthanasia. This is\ndistinguishable from homicide in that the patient has either consented to the assisted death or is\nunable to (e.g. comatose), and the intervention is regarded as a \u2018mercy killing\u2019; it does, however ,\nremain illegal in the majority of countries.\n1 Office for National Statistic s (2016) National population projections: 2016-based statistical bulletin . \nhttps://www .ons.gov .uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/bulletins/nationalpopulationprojections\nsince-the-2014-based-projections  [accessed 1 1 July 2018].\n2 McManus S, Bebbington P, Jenkins R, Brugha T (eds) (2016) Mental health and wellbeing in England : adult psychiatric morbidity survey\n2014 , p. 44.

The intoxicating effects of alcohol were most probably\ndiscovered independently in many cultures around the time of the\nevolution of agriculture, possibly on noting fermentation in fruit.\nAncient peoples produced alcoholic beverages from a wide variety of\nmaterials, including fruits, berries, honey , corn, barley , wheat, sugar\ncane, and potatoes. The use of alcohol by individuals has been\nvariously regarded, from complete tolerance through to outright\nprohibition.\nAlcohol has always had a place in the lifestyles and formal rituals\nof many  peopl es around the world. It was used as an intoxicant in\nreligious rituals, as a celebration, as a gift, as a greeting, and to mark\nbirths and deaths. For almost as long as alcohol use is recorded,\nthere are recorded attempts at control on its use by the authorities.\nIn 92 ad, the Roman emperor Domitian attempted to restrict wine\nproduction and its distribution and sale. Similar restrictions were\nattempted at various times by other leaders, sometimes\naccompanied by moral disapproval of drinking or drunkenness in\nparticular . In medieval Britain, ale was a staple part of the diet and\nwas consumed in huge quantities, while drunkenness, particularly\namong the clergy , was frowned upon by the Christian churches.\nConsumption of wine, however , continued to play a role in Christian\nworship. After  initially preaching moderation, Mohammed later\nforbade the use of alcohol to followers of his religion, possibly as a\nway of dif ferentiating his converts from the Christians around them."

Public consumption of distilled liquor became prevalent in\nthe eighteenth  century , and the accompanying social problems,\ntogether with the conservative attitudes of the emerging Protestant\nclergy , led to a developing moral disapproval of alcohol consumption.\nIn the mid-eigh teenth century , as part of a continuing military and\ntrade dispute with France, the British government imposed heavy\ntaxes on French wine imports and encouraged the distillation of\ncheap domesti c spirits\u2014in particular , gin.

It is now believed that, in addition to these\ngeneral effects , there are neurotransmitter-specific effects , including:\nenhancement of GABA-A transmission (anxiolytic effects), release of\nDA in the mesolimbic system (euphoriant and \u2018reward\u2019 effects), and\ninhibition of NMDA-mediated  glutaminergic transmission (amnesic\neffects).

Ninety-eight per cent of\nalcohol metabo lism takes place in the liver. Approximately  1 unit (or\n8g) of alcohol can be metabolized per hour.

They\nproposed that to minimize health risks from alcohol, a new limit of 14\nunits per week for both men and women who drink regularly was\nrecommended. This constitutes a reduction for men, the previous\nlimit being 21 units per week. For those drinking up to 14 units,\nspreading the drinking over 3 or more days is advised. Drink-free\ndays per week are also recommended. For pregnant women, no\nalcohol during  pregnancy is advised as the safest approach. For\nsingle-occasion drinking, advice is to limit the total amount in one\nsitting. Drinking  at a slower pace with food and alternating  with water\nis recommended.\nCertain groups that may be more vulnerable to the effects of\nalcohol, e.g. those at risk of falls, those with medical or mental health\nconditions, or those on prescribed medication with the potential to\ninteract with alcohol, are advised to be more cautious with their\nlevels of drinking on any single occasion. Risks encountered from\nheavier drinking are highlighted, including a range of medical\nproblems (cancers of the mouth and throat) and risks of death from\nlong-term illnesses.

The tendency of cannabis\nsmokers to inhale deeply and to retain the smoke in the lungs for as\nlong as possible will exacerbate this risk. There are no reports of\nfatal OD. Chronic harmful effects include dysthymia,\nanxiety/depressive illnesses, the disputed amotivational syndrome\n(possibly representing a combination of chronic intoxication in a\nheavy user and a long half-life).

For outpatient initiation of\nmethadone maintenance, arrange to review the patient in the\nmorning, with them having consumed no opiates for 24hrs.

Also, the classification of\nmental health \u2018derangements \u2019 for young people was similar to those\nused for the adult population.\nChild psychiatry as a specialty began to develop in the early 1920s\nfrom the fusion of a number  of disparate professions and agencies\nthat had contact with trouble d young people, including the medical\nprofession, education, psychology , and the criminal courts. This led\nto the formatio n of child guidance clinics, established in response to\nan increasing awareness that psychological problem s start in\nchildhood and that early intervention is the best way to prevent future\nmental illness. The first child guidance clinic in Europe was founded\nin the East End of London in 1927, and thereafter their formation\nspread rapidly . These services tended to be community-based, with\nlimited provision of hospit al-based services. Early treatments\nfocused on the psychoanalytic theories of Anna Freud and Melanie\nKlein and play therapy , with concurrent guidance being offered to the\nparent. The integration of behavioural approaches, family therapy ,\nand psychoph armacology were later developments, reflecting\nadvances in other areas of psychiatry . A subsequent merging of child\nguidance clinics and inpatie nt services in the 1970s led to the\nformation of community services, although these were still disparate\nand variable in their approach and organization. In the 1990s, a\nmodel was proposed of Child and Adolescent Mental Health\nServices (CAMHS) provision being organized into four different tiers,\nand this contin ues to be the present-day structure of services in the\nUK.\nThe term CAMHS is used in two dif ferent ways:\n\u2022The first is a generic term for all services that suppo rt young\npeople with emotional, psychological, and mental health dif ficulties."

It highlights that to be able to fully understand their\ndifficulties and formulate an effective management plan, we need to\nconsider the different biological, psychological, and social factors at\nplay, which might be contributing to the young person\u2019 s presentation\nin a variety of ways. It is important to remember that several factors\nmay interact with each other too, giving rise to symptoms. It is helpful\nto hold the biopsychosocial model in mind throughout all stages of\nassessment and intervention.\nChildren, young people, and their families\nIt is unusual for a young person, especially a child, to come into\ncontact with CAMHS at their own request. More commonly , they\nhave been referred because someone else is concerned about them\n\u2014often a parent, but sometim es a teacher or social worke r\u2014and the\nyoung person does not necessarily acknowledge they need help or\nagree to referral. It is important to remember this from the outset; the\nidentified \u2018patient\u2019 may be a reluctant attendee at an appointment,\nexperiencing a variety of different emotions, including anger and\nirritation about  being \u2018dragged along\u2019, or fear and uncertainty about\nwhat to expect, all of which have implications for fostering\nengagement and therapeutic relationships. The situation can be very\nsimilar where a family has been referred against their will to CAMHS\nby statutory agencies such as social work."

It is a\ntime of rapid development and is distinct from being a \u2018mini-adult\u2019.\nThe average age of onset of puberty has fallen, and this means that\nparticularly in the developed world, individuals achieve physical and\nsexual maturity  before they assume adult roles.

Coupled with changes in brain development, this can\nbring with it positive experiences, but also vulnerability and risk.\nBrain development continues throughout childhood, adole scence,\nand young adulthood, and we are learning more about this though\nstructural and functional imaging. Some of the biggest changes in\nadolescent brain development are in the prefrontal cortex,  to do with\ncognitive proce sses, planning, impulse control, and risk-taking.

This process can be influenced by\nbiological, environmental, social, and emotional experien ces.

Good-quality relationships, based on sensitiv e, reliable,\nand consistent caregiving, help children build a positive attachment\nor bond  with the people closest to them. At times of stress, infants\nseek comfort and soothing. If they receive attuned care, their levels\nof stress hormone decrease. Children who do not have caregivers\nable to help soothe distress can have high levels of cortisol, which\ncan cause damage to neuron s. A child\u2019 s ability to safely understand\nand regulate their emotions, understand the emotions of others, and\ntrust in relationships can also be greatly af fected.8\nMary Ainsworth (1970)9 devised the Strange Situation experiment\nwith 12- to 18-month-old infants, which categorized infant\u2013parent\nrelationships into three distinct groups: secure, insecure  avoidant,\nand insecure ambivalent. This experiment involves separations and\nreunions with caregivers and observes response. A fourth category ,\ndisorganized, was added by Mary Main in 198610 (see Table 15.1 )."

Sleep\ndisturbance is a frequent problem and can have a very negative\nimpact on a child\u2019 s and family\u2019 s level of functioning and quality of life.\nIt is important to ask children , young people, and families about any\ndifficulties getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as asking about\nany unusual night-time activity or daytime tiredness. A clear history\nof curre nt bedtime routine, including time, pattern of sleep, activity\nbefore bed, and eating/drinking before bed, is helpful. Evidence is\nbuilding for the detrimental effect of electronic devices on children\u2019 s\nsleep due to the ef fect of blue-wavelength light on melatonin.\nThe physiology of sleep changes from birth through adolescence,\nas does  the sleep requirement. The prevalence of sleep disorders in\nthe CAM HS population is not clear , as they do not always fulfil the\nfull diagnostic criteria for disorder as for adult sleep disorders.\nHigh rates of sleep disturbance are seen in anxiety , trauma,\ndepression, neurodevelopmental disorder , ID, substance misuse,\nand some physical health disorders. This can be a symp tom of the\ndisorder itself or a side effect of treatments offered. Other reasons\ninclude narcolepsy , RLS, nightmares, night terrors (young children,\nshortly after falling asleep, appear highly distressed and seem\nawake but are still asleep), and sleepwalking.\nManagement involves treatin g any physical cause or iatrogenic\nside effect, sleep hygiene, behavioural work, and sometimes\nmedication under specialist advice.\nAnxiety disorders: overview\nAnxiety and fear are an inherent part of the human condition and, in\ntimes of danger , are often adaptive. As a result of changing\ndevelopmental and cognitive abilities during childhood, the content of\nnormal fears and anxieties shifts from concerns about concrete"

Common substances are: dirt,\nstones, hair, faeces, plastic , paper , wood, string, etc. It is particularly common in individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities and may be dangerous or life-threatening, depending on the substance\ningested. Consequences may include toxicity , infection, or GI tract ulceration/obstruction. Typically\noccurs during second and third years of life, although young pregnant women may exhibit pica during\npregnancy . Hypothesized causes include: nutritional deficiencies; cultural factors (e.g. clay);\npsychosocial stress; malnutrition and hunger; and brain disorders (e.g. hypothalamic problem).\nRumination disorder\nDSM-5 (and ICD-1 1: rumin ation\u2013regurgitation disorder) diagnosis characterized by voluntary or\ninvoluntary regurgitation and re-chewing of partially digested food. Occurs within a few minutes\npostprandial and may last 1\u20132hrs. Regurgitation appears effortless and is preceded by belching. Typical\nonset 3\u20136mths of age; may persist for several months and then spontaneously remit. Also occurs in\nolder individuals with ID. May result in weight loss, halitosis, dental decay , aspiration, recurrent\nrespiratory tract infection (RTI), and sometimes asphyxiation and death (5\u201310% of cases). Causes\ninclude: ID; GI tract pathology; psychiatric disorders; and psychosocial stress. Treatment includes\nphysical examination and investigations, behavioural methods, and nutritional advice."

Some of their physical effects are irreversible, e.g. deepening of the voice, and the negative\nimpact of hormones on a young person\u2019 s fertility also needs to be considered prior to their initiation.\nConsent and capacity also need to be assessed.\n\u2022Stage 4\u2014Gender-af firming surgery . These irreversible procedures include bilateral mastectomy and\nchest reconstruction surgery , and genital (or gender reassignment) surgery\u2014the latter is not offered to\nadolescents.\nYoung people\u2019 s gender identity services encourage a collaborative network approach, maintaining\nclose links and regular liaison with other professionals involved with the young person.\nAssociated mental health difficulties\nYoung people with gender dysphoria experience high rates of depression, self-harm, and suicidal\nideation, most likely as a consequence of bullying and stigmatization. Accepting the recent increase in\nthe number of referrals to gender services, it is likely that a growing number of these young people will\nalso have contact with local CAMHS teams.\nIt is also increasingly recognized that there is a much higher prevalence of ASD in the gender\ndysphoric popu lation than would be expected, and with less of a \u2642:\u2640 ratio differentiation. The reasons\nfor this are unclear and require further research\u2014are these separate or co-occurring conditions? Is\ndysphoria a reflection of ASD \u2018restricted interests\u2019? Asses sment can be more protracted in such cases,\nbut a diagnosis of ASD does not preclude an individual also meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of\ngender dysphoria.\nICD-1 1 rename s GID \u2018Gender incongruence (of childhoo d; of adolescence or adulthood)\u2019 and shifts\nthe concept outside of \u2018Men tal, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorders\u2019 and into \u2018Conditions\nrelated to sexual health\u2019. There is increasing awareness that gender is not a binary concept (i.e. \u2642/\u2640),\nand some people identify as non-binary; this will need to be reflected in future revisions of operational\ncriteria.\nSubstance misuse in children and adolescents\nSubstance misuse is increas ingly common in young people.

This may include: responding to\nchildren presenting with psychiatric crises in acute medical settings; management of unexplained\nsymptoms; treating anxiety and mood disorders which are comorbid with chronic paediatric and life-\nlimiting conditions; and diagnosing and managing children with complex neuropsychiatric disorders.\nMental health disorders are more prevalent in children with chronic paediatric conditions, particularly\nneurological, e.g. >35% of children with epilepsy will have an associated psychiatric disorder . Families\nappreciate that their children benefit from having all of these difficulties understood and treated in the\none setting. A paediatric liaison service is not simply a CAMHS service located within a paediatric\nsetting, but rather an MDT focusing on supporting paediatric practice through clinical discussions, joint\nwork, teaching, and research activities.\nChildren and young people present to paediatric settings with self-harm, and in addition to supporting\ntheir psychiatric assessment and follow-up, paediatric liaison psychiatry clinicians have an important role\nin training paediatric staff, so that their response is compassionate and timely and supports the\nmanagement of risk in this vulnerable population.

With ABI\nwhich may be due to trauma, cancer , or infection, there is a recognized pattern of acute and chronic\nneuropsychiatric vulnerability that requires a team approach to rehabilitation, involving a range of mental\nhealth skills in nursing, psychology , and psychiatry . Often a joint assessment involving both a\npsychiatrist and a neurologist is the most efficient way to make a case formulation and plan further\ninvestigation and therapy . A similar approach is required for medically unexplained symptoms (MUS)\nwhich can affect any system in the body , with children and young people regularly presenting with non-\nepileptic seizures and motor or sensory dif ficulties.\nChildren and young people with intellectual disabilities\nChildren and young people  with ID have disproportionately higher rates of mental health and\nbehavioural difficulties, physical comorbidities, adverse life events, and poverty than their typically\ndeveloping peers. Around 40% will have a comorbid mental health disorder . These can be more difficult\nto recognize, especially if the patient has limited or no verbal communication. Diagnostic over-\nshadowing can lead to significant changes in presentation being misattributed to ID, rather than\ncomorbid mental, physical, or psychological disorder .\nPatients may present in crisis or distress on a backgrou nd of longer-term changes in presentation.\nBiopsychosocial assessment is particularly important for patients with IDs. It is always important to\nexclude underlying physical health causes, e.g. pain, acute infection, or constipation. This is especially\nimportant if the ID is the result of a disorder with recognized medical complications, e.g. tuberous\nsclerosis. There is increasing information available about genetic disorders which also have a\nbehavioural phenotype, i.e. characteristic patterns of motor , cognitive, linguistic, and social\nabnormalities.35\nMultidisciplinary assessment is often required to provide a formulation which confirms diagnoses but\nalso identifies additional protective factors or issues that can support or might hinder therapeutic\ninterventions, e.g. sensory impairments/processing abnormalities, social and communication difficulties,\nsleep abnormalities, and psychosocial or iatrogenic factors.\nInterventions are rarely uni-modal and should be specific and targeted to realistic goals. They should\nbe deve loped in collaboration with the patient and their family/carers and within the context of involved\nservices, e.g. may require additional community-based resources from social services. They should be\nculturally sensi tive and appropriate to the patient\u2019 s physical and mental health needs. Psychoeducation\nshould be accessible to the patient and family to help them understand the IDs and comorbid dif ficulties.\nThere is often pressure on doctors to prescribe medicati on, especially at times of crisis. The cost\u2013\nbenefit ratio for prescribing any medication should be carefully considered. Medication is only helpful if it\nis appropriatel y targeted to a significant underlying symp tom, e.g. anxiety . Short-term sedation in the\nabsence of a clear assessment and care plan can further  reduce the patient\u2019 s adaptive functioning and\nopportunities for learning. If medication is required, it is often used off licence. It is therefore important\nto:\n\u2022Identify any relative and absolute contraindications to medication, based on the patient\u2019 s current\npresentation and past history .\n\u2022Identify symptoms that can be successfully managed, and include baseline assessments.\n\u2022Identify what other appropriate interventions might be needed. e.g. psychological.\nMedication should be proposed as a trial, bearing in mind its mode of action, adverse effects (which\nmay be more likely in a patient with IDs), and potential interactions with other medication the patient\nmay be taking. It should also be in a preparation acce ptable to the patient, e.g. whether they can\nswallow it or tolerate the smell/taste. This can be especially problematic for patients on the autism\nspectrum.\nInformed cons ent should be sought from the patient, and if they are deemed not to have capacity to\ngive it, the necessary legislation should be used.\nThe outcomes  of any interventions should be monito red by reviewing the presence of target\nsymptoms, the impact of potential adverse ef fects and the patient\u2019 s adaptive functioning.\nForensic child and adolescent psychiatry"

Forensic Child and\nAdolescent Mental Health Services (FCAMHS) across the country have been set up to deliver\nassessment and treatment to a complex population in whom multiple comorbidities, social and\neducational disadvantages, higher incidence of physica l ill health, and frequent drug and alcohol\nproblems are present.\nLooked after and local authority-accommodated, young people are more likely to have a mental\ndisorder (46% ) than a matched socially disadvantaged control group (15%) living in private\nhouseholds.36 Young  people in secure care have higher rates (three times) of mental disorder than\ncontrols in the community .37 Apart from CDs, other psychiatric comorbidities include affective disorders,\npsychosis, anxiety disorders,  ADHD, substance misuse disorder , and personality disorders. One study38\nshowed that \u2640 sentenced young of fenders had a 32% (16% in \u2642) lifetime history of suicidal attempt.\nMany studies have shown that the peak age for a minor offending is 17\u201318yrs, of whom only a\nminority (5\u201310%) who are more likely to have experienced over a prolonged period of time severe family\nadversity and coercive parental style persist into adulthood .39 Callous and unemotional personality traits\nmay arise as a result of multiple genetic, perinatal, and early developmental factors (early attachment\ndifficulties, poor peer relationships, and serious early life child sexual abuse).40 A few longitudinal\nstudies have shown that children with CD at the age of 7yrs are ten times more likely to be involved in\ncriminality in adulthood.41 Childhood adversity (physical neglect, poor parental supervision, disrupted\nfamily , large family size, a convicted parent, mother with depression) between the ages of 8 and 10yrs is\na good indicator of later antisocial traits.42\nSecure CAMHS services\nA range of services are available to offending adolescents, including adolescent inpatient services,\nsecure hospita ls, forensic CAMHS, general CAMHS, youth offender institutions (YOIs), youth offending\nteams (YOT s), secure trainin g centres (STCs), specialis t schools, social services, secure children\u2019 s\nhomes (SCHs), voluntary sector , and adult mental health services. Services widely vary across the UK.\nForensic adolescent consultation and treatment service (F ACTS)\nThere are three such Tier 4 services in England and Wales, and they provide specialist consultation,\nassessment, and treatment to mostly 10- to 18-year olds who present with high-risk behaviours in the\ncommunity in the context of significant mental health need s. These teams have emerged from, and are\nusually aligned to, local medium secure units.\nCommunity-based forensic teams (FCAMHS)\nThese Tier 3 and 4 community teams have emerged from local CAMHS services and provide specialist\nassessment, treatment, and consultation service to courts, YOIs, YOTs, STCs, CAMHS, Looked After\nand Accommodated Children (LAAC) services.\nSecure inpatient services\nThe majority of secure CAM HS inpatient services meet medium secure standards, but they look after\nyoung people who, on one hand, may be ready for transition to community services and, on the other ,\nmeet high-secure referral criteria (there is no high-secure provision for young people). Referral to\nmedium secur e units is through the National Commissi oning Group (NCG)43 that meets weekly to\nconsider referrals nationally . There are also low-secure units both in the NHS and in the independent\nsector . All the above units are mostly based in England. Scotland does not have secure inpatient\nservices for adolescents and refers patients to England via the NCG.

This is particularly important in regard to the dynamics\nand kinetics of medication.48,49 Some drugs are metabolized faster , while others more readily cross\nthe blood\u2013brain barrier . Susceptibility to side effects also varies with age (e.g. children are more likely\nto develop dystonias and less likely to develop akathisia with neuroleptic treatment).\n\u2022Medication should be considered as just one component of treatment\u2014it should be accompanied by\npsychological, social, and educational interventions.\n\u2022Medication is often prescribed for symptoms, rather than syndromes (e.g. stimulants for hyperactivity\nsymptoms in a variety of disorders).\n\u2022Drug trials in children are problematic, both ethically and practically , so there are inadequate data\nregarding safety and efficacy for many psychotropics. Clinicians are often faced with ethical decisions\nregarding the use of medication not licensed for use in these age groups.\n\u2022The decision to prescribe needs to take into account both the young person\u2019 s and the parents\u2019\nattitudes to medication, and to consider issues of consent and capacity .\n\u2022Potential benefits and risks have to be weighed up in each case, fully discussed with families and\nrecorded in the notes. Often providing written information can be helpful.\n\u2022Start low and go slow. Startin g doses with children and adolescents are often at least half that of what\nwould be prescribed in adults.\n\u2022Dose titrations are done gradually , with close attention to side ef fects.\n\u2022Avoid polypharmacy where possible.\n\u2022Some children and young people can also have paradoxical reactions to medication, e.g. BDZs can\ncause severe agitation.\n\u2022Drug monitorin g in accordance with local and national guidelines should always be carried out, e.g.\nantipsychotic medication, ADHD medication.\nFamily therapy\nWhile FT or systemic practice is a treatment we tend to associate more specifically with child and\nadolescent psychiatry nowadays, its origins actually stem from research in adult psychiatry carried out in\nthe 1940s and 1950s looking at the impact of different patterns of communication and interaction in\nfamilies where a member had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.50 FT has been influenced by many different\nschools of thought since then, including psychodynamic theory , general systems theory , social\nconstructionism, feminist ideas, and attachment theory ."

In addition, the causality of a problem is described as \u2018circular \u2019, rather\nthan linear .\nBy the general systems theory , all systems strive to maintain homeostasis, i.e. resist change.\nHowever , all families are constantly experiencing change, as individual family members grow , develop,\nand individuate (or not); this is described as the family life cycle. These changes present challenges for\nall families, e.g. an emerging  adolescent striving for independence, and problems arise when the family\nbecomes \u2018stuck\u2019 and is not able to resolve successfully these transitions.\nFT can be used wherever it is recognized there are difficulties in family relationships. Depending on\nthe problem, it may be used as the main treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry or concurrently\nwith other treatments such as individual therapy and/or medication.\nKey elements of some different family therapy models\nStructural FT  Minuchin proposed that clear rules govern optimal family organization and structure, with\na focus  on hierarchy , subsystems, and boundaries. Challenges to this structure results in problems\nwhich the family attempts, with success, to address. In this model, the therapist takes a directive,\n\u2018expert\u2019 stance to change family behaviours and re-establish the preferred structure.\nStrategic FT In this model, developed by Haley , problems always arise because of difficulties with\nhierarchy within the family system. Haley suggested that rather than attempting to resolve this, the\nfamily was ambivalent about having the problem, as it provided some gain for them. Reflecting this idea,\nthe therapist takes a more strategic stance to overcome their resistance, such as using \u2018paradox\u2019, e.g.\nsuggesting the problem may not be resolvable, and setting family tasks such as \u2018prescribing\u2019 or\n\u2018pretending\u2019 the problematic symptom.\nIn these early models of FT, the therapist was very much the \u2018expert\u2019, with a focus only on behaviour .\nFailure to comply was interpreted as resistance, and there was no acknowledgement of a family\u2019 s\nbeliefs, feeling s, or past experience. Subsequent models of FT began to address this power imbalance,\nrecognizing the family as the real \u2018experts\u2019 in what might be effective, with more of a focus on\ncollaboration as the therapist works with the family to jointly explore their dif ficulties.\nMilan systemic FT This model was developed in the early 1970s in response to the closure of large\npsychiatric institutions in Italy. There is increasing empha sis on family beliefs and meanings, and the\nidea of there being no single objective truth about the problem. The Milan model introduced the\nconcepts of \u2018re-framing\u2019 the problem and hypothesizing, as well as ideas about neutrality and curiosity ,\nwith the therapist taking more of a \u2018not-knowing\u2019, non-expert stance.\nMore recent developments in FT reflect the influence  of social constructionism. There is also\nrecognition that the family is the expert\u2014the therapist \u2018joins\u2019 them to work collaboratively to resolve the\nproblem\u2014and more of a focus on the use of language; examples include:\nNarrative FT Difficulties are a reflection of unhelpful, dominant, \u2018problem-saturated\u2019 narratives (or\nstories) we hold about ourselves. The therapist helps to highlight \u2018unique outcomes\u2019 to challenge this\nnarrative and, through the use of \u2018externalization\u2019, i.e. separating the problem from the person, helps to\nrewrite this to a more helpful one.\nSolution-focused FT This is the opposite of taking a \u2018problem-focused\u2019 medical history , with an\ninterest on exceptions and solutions. Goals and scales are used, and the \u2018Miracle Question\u2019, problem-\nfree talk, and complements are important elements of this approach.\nCircular questioning  Karl Tomm highlighted that the different way a questio n is asked about a\nproblem\u2014either \u2018circular \u2019 or\u2019 linear \u2019\u2014can be a therapeutic intervention in itself, serving to either add\nadditional information and open new possibilities of change for the family or maintain the restricted\nstatus quo, respectively .\nMost FT pract itioners work using an integrated approach , incorporating elements of many different\nmodels, which allows for flexibility and best \u2018fit\u2019 with each family . Also, some therapists work as part of a\nteam using a one-way mirror . Use of the reflecting team lets the family observe the team \u2018reflect\u2019 on their\nprior conversation with the therapist, so allowing new perspectives and possibilities to emerge."

Provision of forensic services varies across the country , and forensic\npsychiatrists work in a variety  of settings (e.g. high-security hospitals; medium-secure units; low-\nsecure wards and sometimes open wards; outpatients, day hospitals, and within community\nteams; prisons).\nThis chapter on forensic psychiatry concentrates on mentally disordered offenders.

Hence, although some aspects have fairly\nwide applicability (e.g. the relationship between mental disorder and offending), many aspects\n(e.g. legal provisions for mentally disordered offenders) are specific to a particular jurisdiction.\nWe have tried to cover the main legal jurisdictions of the British Isles\u2014England and Wales,\nScotland, Northern Ireland (NI), and the Republic of Ireland (RoI)\u2014in some detail.\nT able 16.1 Abbreviations used to refer to legislation\na article\np paragraph\ns section\nsch schedule\nMHA 1983 Mental Health Act 1983\nMHA 2001 Mental Health Act 2001\nMH(NI)O 1986 Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986\nMCA(NI) 2016 Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016\nMH(CT)(S)A 2003 Mental Health (Care and T reatment) (Scotland) Act 2003\nCP(S)A 1995 Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995\nCJ(NI)A 1966 Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 1966\nCJ(NI)O 1996 Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1996\nCL(I)A 2006/2010 Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006/amended 2010\nCP(IUP)A 1991 Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991\nPoCC(S)A 2000 Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000\nOther legislation will be referred to in full, or abbreviations used in tables or boxes will be\nexplained where they arise.\nA brief history of forensic psychiatry\nMajor crimes carried out by those who are mentally unwell are referred to in Greek mythology ,\nancient drama, and philosophical writings. Heracles (known as Hercules by the Romans) was\npunished with madness by the jealous Goddess Hera. He misidentified and killed his children,\nmistaking them  as attackers before embarking on his atoning labours. Orestes, driven to despair\nfollowing his father \u2019s death, hears the voice of the Gods commanding him to kill the perpetrator\u2014\nhis mother . His story , depicte d in the original courtroom drama by Euripides (c.480\u2013406 bc), sees\nhim acquitted by the casting vote of the head judge as the jury is split 50:50 as to his culpability .\nPlato (c.428\u2013347 bc), writing a model law for his utopian republic, suggested a reduced\npunishment for mentally disordered homicide perpetrators.\nThe first identified mentally disordered offender was Aelius Priscus in 180 ce. When asked\nwhether he, a man who killed his mother in a fit of rage, should be held responsible for the crime,\nthe joint Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus replied that if it was determined that\nPriscus\u2019 s actio ns were the result of furor due to alienat ion of the mind and that he killed his\nmother under the guise of madness, then punishment need not be considered since he is\npunished enou gh by madness itself.

The burden of\nconfinement fell to the families in the first instance.\nThat advice was to influence the development of the insanity defence across Europe and was\ncited in homicide cases in Venice until the Middle Ages. The English jurist Henri de Bracton\n(c.1210\u20131268) wrote about criminal intent, stating that only through examination of the actions\nand intent of a crime can the commission of a criminal act be established. Richard of Cheddestan\n(1270) who, while deranged,  killed his wife and children before failing to kill himself was simply\nconfined to prison by the Sherif f of Norfolk and thus was subject to a special Royal Inquiry .\nBy the eighteenth century , there were a number of legal writings about the insanity defence\nand tests for fitness to plead, but there was no disposal to psychiatric hospital for those acquitted.\nIn 1800 , King George III narrowly missed being killed by a bullet, as he entered the Royal Box at\nDrury Lane Theatre. The assailant was James Hadfield, an ex-military man who, following a head\ninjury , had conversations with God and laboured under various religious delusions. At his trial for\nhigh treason, Hadfield\u2019 s lawye r successfully argued that he was insane at the time of the offence.\nUntil that time, defendants acquitted on the grounds of insanity were generally released back to\nthe safekeeping of their families. This case led to the development of the Criminal Lunatics Act of\n1800, which allowed for the indefinite detention of insane  defendants. Hadfield was admitted to\nBethlem Hospital where he spent the remainder of his life.\nInsanity law, as we recognize it today , led from the acquittal on the grounds of insanity of\nDaniel M\u2019Naghten in 1843. He had attempted to murder Prime Minister Robert Peel but instead\nshot and killed the Prime Minister \u2019s private secretary Edward Drummond. At trial, his defence\nsuccessfully argued that M\u2019Naghten\u2019 s delusions of perse cution had rendered him no longer a\nreasonable and responsible being. Due to the controversy of the case, the House of Lords posed\nquestions to a panel of judges, and the answer to one such question, regarding the legal\ndefinition of insanity , became enshrined in law as the M\u2019Naghten Rules (\n  Legal criteria , p. 779).\nThe evolution of forensic services\nAfter the development of the Criminal Lunatics Act of 1800, special wings at Bethlem Hospital\nwere establish ed. The Central Mental Hospital in Dublin was the first secure hospital in Europe\nand began in 1850 as Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum for Ireland. In England, a secure\ninstitution was opened in 1863 at Broadmoor Hospital to house an increasing population of\nmentally ill offenders at Bethlem. Further high-security or \u2018special\u2019 hospitals opened later in the\ntwentieth century\u2014Rampton in 1912 as an overflow facility  for Broadmoor , and Ashworth in 1988\nfollowing a merger of Moss Side Hospital and Park Lane Hospital, itself opened as a Broadmoor\noverspill unit in 1974. In Scotland, Carstairs was an Army Hospital from 1939 to 1948 before\nbecoming the \u2018State Institution for Mental Defectives\u2019, and following the transfer of criminally\ninsane prisoners from HM Prison Perth, it was renamed the \u2018State Mental Hospital\u2019 in 1957,\ncovering both Scotland and NI.\nIn the 1970s, Graham Young , an ex-patient of Broadmoor Hospital, poisoned a number of his\nwork colleagues, leading to convictions of murder and attempted murder . Subsequent\nrecommendations made in the Butler Report  of 1975 led to the creation of medium-secure\nhospitals to act as intermediate step-down units between high-secure care and the community in\nthe 1980s. Later , in 1992, the Reed Report  empha sized the importance  of close-to-home care\nand the least restrictive altern ative. This, together with the increasing population of prisoners and\ncommunity patients requiring secure hospital care, led to the creation of low-security hospitals,\noffering a bridge between secure care and community living (\n  Low-security units , p. 751).\nThe criminal justice system\nThe criminal justice process\nThe following outlines the chain of events that may happen, following the commission of an\noffence."

The age of criminal responsibility is 10yrs old in\nEngland and Wales and NI, 12yrs in RoI, and 8yrs in Scotland, but the minimal age of\nprosecution is 12yrs.

Only about half of crimes is reported to the police (and officially recorded), of\nwhich 13% resulted in a charge/summons (9% for sexual assaults) in England and Wales in\n2016. Peak rates 18\u201320yrs for \u2642, 2\u20133yrs earlier for \u2640.

            "Text": "The definitions of what constitutes murder differs across the individual nations in the UK and\nRoI. In England, Wales, and NI, the offender must be of sound mind and discretion and had\nmalice aforethought. Intent is assumed if reckless, knowing that death or serious injury was a\nvirtual certainty . The definition is narrower in the RoI which incorporates an intentional act to\nkill. In Scotland, murder is committed when the accused acted with the intention to kill or acted\nwith \u2018wicked recklessness\u2019.\nScotland differs from England , Wales, NI, and the RoI, with the crime of culpable homicide,\ninstead of manslaughter . There is no legal category for suicide pacts. Additionally , there is no\ncrime of infanticide in Scotland.\nV iolence 1: theoretical background\nViolence is an act that caus es injury or harm, but notions of what constitutes acceptable and\nunacceptable behaviour and what constitutes harm are culturally influenced and constantly under\nreview , as values and social norms evolve. For example, use of corporal punishment in schools\nwas once common, but now such punishment would constitute assault. Besides death and\nphysical injury , psychological insults, property damage, and verbal abuse also constitute harm.\nThis section will focus on acts of physical assault on others.\nT ypes of aggression\nViolence can be classified in terms of determinants, goals, victims, characteristics of the act, or\nmotivation. Aggressive acts can incorporate both instrumental and expressive elements, e.g.\naggression used to subdue a victim for sexual gratific ation (instrumental) and as an angry\nreaction to the victim fighting back (expressive).\n\u2022Instrumental aggression \u2014occurs as a by-product of trying to attain a goal. The act of violence\nis not an end, but a means to some other end, e.g. aggression in a mugging is aimed at\nobtaining money. Predatory aggression is a related term used in animal studies to describe\naggression used for hunting food. Sadistic aggression is a form of instrumental violence used\nto achieve sexual and/or emotional pleasure through control and /or inflicting harm on a victim.\n\u2022Expressive aggression \u2014(aka hostile or affective aggression) is affect-driven. It is triggered by a\nstrong, someti mes disproportionate, emotional response (usually anger) to a situation. Acts\ntend to be impulsive, brief, and explosive, but they may be planned. The primary goal is to\nharm the other person; examples are violence in respon se to the discovery of infidelity or in\nresponse to being threatened. Specific types of expressive aggression which occur primarily in\nthe animal kingdom are intermale, maternal, and territorial aggression.\nTheories of aggression\n\u2022 Biological  Etholo gical studies of animals suggest that aggression functions to ensure\npopulation control by aiding selection of the strongest for reproduction and social organization;\nlow levels of 5-HT activity and cholesterol associated with aggression; modest genetic\ncontribution; limbic and frontal areas important in determining aggression; testosterone may\nhave a role.\n\u2022 Psychodynamic  Freud:  aggres sion initially seen as a response to frustration, later as an\ninstinct; hostile character traits may be caused by fixation  at/regression to oral or anal stage.\nEgo psychologists:  aggres sive instinct needs to be sublimated or displaced. Neo-Freudians:\nemphasized sociocultural origins of aggression. Attachment theory:  emphasizes early\nrelationships and the impact of their disruption on adult interaction.\n\u2022 Learning theory  Rewar ding/reinforcing contingencies important, leading to the development\nand maintenance of aggressive responses to certain stimu li or in order to attain a goal (material\ngain, escape from aversive stimulus). Frustration aggression hypothesis : frustra tion leads to\naggression, depending on the perceived value of the blocked goal and the degree of\nfrustration; punishment may inhibit aggression but may itself be frustrating or provide model for\naggression.

Social process theory:\nsocialization process through contact with institutions and social organizations steers the\nindividual towa rds violence. Neutralization theory:  neutralization of personal beliefs and values,\nas the person drifts between conventional and offending behaviour . Social control theory:  direct\n(e.g. through punishment) and indirect (e.g. through social affiliation) control prevents violence.\nLabelling theory:  an original deviant act (primary deviance) results in stigmatization and\nlabelling, leadi ng to hostility , alienation, and resentment in the individual and further deviant\nbehaviour (secondary deviance).\nV iolence 2\nCauses of a violent act\nViolent acts involve a perpe trator , a victim, and contextual factors. There will usually be an\ninterplay betwe en factors related to these three. Many of the background factors associated with\noffending generally (\n Crime , p. 728) are associated with violence, although violent offenders\nare usually young adults, rather than teenagers. The specific factors of importance in determining\nthe occurrence of aggressive acts are the same as those needing to be considered in assessing\nrisk of violence (\n  Assessing risk of violence , p. 748).\nT ypes of violent offences\nThere are a wide range of recognized violent offences. For example, in England and Wales,\n\u2018violence with injury\u2019 includes attempted murder , intentional destruction of a viable unborn child,\ncausing death by dangerous driving/careless driving when  under the influence of drink or drugs,\nmore serious wounding or other act endangering life (including grievous bodily harm, with and\nwithout intent),  causing death by aggravated vehicle takin g, assault with injury , and assault with\nintent to cause serious harm and less serious wounding offences. \u2018Violence without injury\u2019 refers\nto threats or conspiracy to murder , harassment, other offences against children, and assault\nwithout injury (formerly comm on assault where there is no injury). The seriousness of an assault\nmay be determined by chance factors such as the availa bility of medical care and the physical\nhealth of the victim. Other ways of categorizing violent offences are in terms of the victims and\ncircumstances: domestic/spousal abuse, child abuse (\n Child maltreatment 2: the duty of care,\np. 714), and elder abuse.\nRates of violence\nSee Table 16.2 \u2014the breakdown in figures can be found within weblinks.\nPsychiatric assessment and management\nThe clinical assessment of a person who has been violent or who appears to be at risk of\nviolence involv es a thorough psychiatric history and an MSE and an assessment of risk (\nAssessing risk of violence , p. 748). If the person is facing criminal charges, then a report may\nhave to be prepared, considering the issues set out in \n  Court reports and giving evidence 1, p.\n764. Management of risk is described in \n  Factors to consider (based on HCR-20), Risk\nmanagement , p. 749. The acute management of violent patients is describ ed in \n  Severe\nbehavioural disturbance , p. 1048 .\nDomestic violence\nOne in four women and one in six men experience domestic violence during their lifetime.\nWomen are victims of 70% of domestic violence. In over 10% of cases, serious injuries occur"

A quarter of those dependent on carers reported significant psychological abuse,\nand a fifth reported neglect.\nSexual offences 1\nOffences range from indecent exposure to rape.2,3 Other types of offences (e.g. homicide,\nassault, robbery , theft, and burglary) may have a sexual component. Sex offending, sexual\ndeviation, and inappropriate sexual behaviour (a range of sexual behaviours which cause offence\nand/or harm to others) are overlapping, but distinct, concepts. A man who commits a sexual\noffence against a child may or may not be a paedophile, and a man who exposes himself may or\nmay not be an exhibitionist. A 17-yr-old \u2642 who has sexual intercourse with his 15-yr-old girlfriend\nis committing a sexual offence but will probably not have a sexual deviation. Here the focus will\nbe on indecent exposure and contact sexual of fences against adults and children.\nT ypes\nThere is a wide range of sexual offending, including, but not limited to, rape, sexual assault (with\nor without penetration), sexual coercion, sexual exposure, voyeurism, administering a substance\nfor sexual purposes, commu nicating indecently (with a child), trafficking for sexual exploitation,\nintercourse with an animal, and soliciting; special legisla tion exists to prosecute sex offenders,\nbut legal classification says little about the actual incident. Whether the behaviour is an offence or\nabusive depen ds on whether the victim is able and willing  to consent. All sexual behaviour with\nchildren is abusive and illegal. Possession of extreme pornography (depicting bestiality ,\nnecrophilia, or severely sadistic acts) is illegal in the UK.\nRape and sexual assaults on adults\nUsually men against women. \u2640 perpetrators uncommon. Most rapists are young men from poor\nsocial and economic backgrounds, who have a history of other offending. Sadistic fantasy is\ncommon in men, but sadistic sexual of fending is rare.\nRape and sexual assaults on children\n\u2640 children are most common ly victimized. Intra-familial abuse  (incest) is usually perpetrated by\nfathers or stepfathers against daughters. Family pathology (dysfunctional families with\ngenerational blurring) often mixed with pathology in the perpetrator (substance misuse,\npersonality disorder). Extra-familial abuse  is less common. Adolescen t offending is associated\nwith poor social skills, physical unattractiveness, and isolation from peers. Adult offenders are\nmore likely to have paedophilic sexual fantasies than adolescent and intra-familial offenders. Can\nreflect general antisocial attitudes or the expression of repressed paedophilic impulses in\nsusceptible, disinhibited men (by alcohol, stress, psych iatric disorder). Many offenders can\nbecome skilled at targeting and grooming victims to gain trust.\nOnline sexual offending against children\nThe Internet has increasingly  become a method of distributing obscene/unlawful sexual images,\nespecially of children. The speed of technological deve lopments and the global reach of the\nInternet, across legal jurisdic tions, have left the police and legal authorities struggling to keep\npace, and the law in this area is continually developing. In England and Wales, the Protection of\nChildren Act 1978 and Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1998 made it an offence for\nanyone to take or allow to be taken, possess, show , distribute, or publish any indecent image of a"

Sex offenders with psychosis\nshare many features of other sex offenders, and offending is rarely due to specific psychotic\nsymptoms. Disinhibitions due to mania or organic disorder s may lead to, usually minor , offences.\nMost sex offences committed by people with ID are asso ciated with lack of sexual knowledge,\npoor social skills, and inability to express a normal sex drive appropriately . A few more serious\nand persistent offenders with ID may share characteristics with other sex offenders. Sexual side\neffects (e.g. anorgasmia, impotence) sometimes cause paradoxical problems such as an\nincrease in masturbation and the devising of more deviant sexual fantasies."

Behaviours include following,\nloitering nearb y, spying on, approaching victims, or communicating via phone calls, text\nmessages, emails, or socia l media. Motivations are varied; different typologies have been\ndescribed. Stalking has existed for centuries but only more recently been construed as a social\nproblem. The first state to criminalize stalking was California in 1990, after a series of high-profile\ncases.\nEpidemiology\nOne in five \u2640 and one in ten \u2642 are stalked at some point in their lifetimes; in the UK, 5 million\npeople are stalked every year; 80\u201390% of perpetrators are \u2642; 80% of victims are \u2640. In a large\nCanadian study , 33% of victims were pursued by an ex-spouse, 14% by an ex-intimate partner ,\n28% by casual acquaintances, 8% by a stranger , 5% by a family member , 5% by a workmate,\nand 2% by a current spouse; 4% of stalkers were unidentified.\nStalker typology\n\u2022Rejected stalkers  Pursue victims in order to reverse, correct, or avenge rejection (e.g. divorce,\ntermination of relationship). Previous sexual relationship. They want to keep victim in their lives.\n\u2022Resentful stalkers  Pursue a vendetta because of a sense of grievance against the victim.\nMotivated by a desire to frighten and distress. Not following a sexual relationship.\n\u2022Incompetent suitors  Despite poor social or court ing skills, incompetent suitors have a fixation\non, or in some cases a sense of entitlement to, an intimate relationship with those who have\nattracted their amorous interest.\n\u2022Predatory stalkers  Initially spy on victims as a precursor to a sexual assau lt. Stalking can be\nsustained in this group due to the stalker taking pleasure  in voyeurism and fantasy about the\ncoming attack. The victim is often a stranger or an acquaintance.\n\u2022Intimacy seekers  Are infatuated with their victims and believe their victims  are infatuated with\nthem too. No previous sexual relationship.\n\u2022Public figure stalkers  Comprise three additional groups: help seekers  (repea tedly seek help\nfrom public figures, as do not know who else to turn to), attention seekers  (hungry for\nnotoriety), and chaotic  (motivation is intense, but uncertain).\nMental disorder\nStalking is a behaviour , not a mental disorder , but research suggests that up to 50% of offenders\nexperience some sort of mental disorder , with personality disorders, schizophrenia and other\npsychotic disor ders, depress ion, and substance use disorders being the most common. Where\nmental disorder does play a role, its contribution varies, depending on the nature of the\nsymptoms experienced. A significant minority of cases occur as a result of erotomanic delusions,\nin which  the stalker believes the victim to be in love with them. These stalkers invest heavily in\ntheir fictional relationships and often believe the victim has been secretly communicating with\nthem through seemingly innocuous acts or via the media. Victims of stalking can develop\ndepression, PTSD-like symptoms, anxiety disorders, and substance misuse problems.\nStalking of health professionals\nHealth professionals (especially mental health professionals) are at \n risk of being stalked,\ncompared to the general public.

Arson is a crime. Pyromania is a psychiatric diagnosis. Arson is one of\nthe easiest crimes to commit. It is considered a serious offence due to the potential to threaten\nlife and cause massive destruction. Only a small proportion (<20%) result in prosecution.\nMotivations  Fire setting can be accidental or intentional. Arson is wilful and malicious,\ntherefore not accidental. Primary gain motives include revenge, attention seeking, delusional,\nexcitement, boredom, sexual pleasure, cry for help, and jealousy . Secondary gain motives\ninclude insurance claims, rehousing, crime concealment, and political protest.\nPsychiatric disorder  Is over-represented in arsonists. Substance use disorders (particularly\nalcohol use) and personality  disorder (particularly antisocial and emotionally unstable) are the\nmost frequent. Psychosis and learning disability are less common. Pyromania is uncommon.\nPyromania  is an impulse-control disorder in ICD-10 (\n Pathological fire-setting/pyromania (ICD-\n10/11; DSM-5) , p. 422), involving a persistent preoccupation with fire and burning. Fire setting is\nassociated with feelings of increasing tension before the act and intense excitement immediately\nafterward.\nAssessment  Full psychiatr ic assessment , with exploration of motive for fire setting and, in\nparticular , any previous history of fire setting.\nManagement  Treatment of any mental illness or substance use disorde r; social skills training;\npsychological therapies (e.g. CBT); restriction of access to fire setting paraphernalia (e.g.\nmatches, lighters) in hospital settings.\nOutcome  Rates of further arson 2\u201320%; rates of any re-of fending 10\u201330%.\nOther damage to property"

However , mental disorder is rarely an issue in car crime.\nMental disorder and offending 1: overview\nWhat is the relationship between mental disorder and offending?\nMental disorder is common and offending is common, so it would not be surprising to find an\nindividual with both. But is the relationship more than coincidental? When looking at studies of\nthis relationship, one needs to consider:\n\u2022The nature of the sample studied (community vs institutional; clinical vs epidemiological; pre-\ntreatment vs post-treatment; of fenders vs non-of fenders).\n\u2022The criteria used to define mental disorder (legal vs clinical vs operationalized) and the method\nused to determine its existence (case notes vs interviews; clinically trained vs lay interviewers).\n\u2022The criteria used to define offending (types of officially recorded offences included; inclusion of\nunreported or unprosecuted \u2018offences\u2019) and the method used to detect offences (official records\nvs self-report vs third-party report).\nMost of the research has focused on violence. The following are the main conclusions to be\ndrawn from current evidence.\n\u2022People with mental disorder as a broad group are no more or less likely to offend than the\ngeneral population.\n\u2022Some specific mental disorders do increase the risk of a person acting violently , particularly\nalcohol- and drug-related disorders and personality  disorders, especially those with\npredominant cluster B characteristics (\n  Classifications of personality disorder , p. 523).\n\u2022Schizophrenia has a modest association with violence, but the overwhelming majority of people\nwith schizophrenia are never violent, being more likely to be victims than perpetrators of\nviolence.\n\u2022In people with mental disorders, the factors most strong ly associated with offending are the\nsame as for non-mentally disordered offenders: \u2642 gender , young age, substance misuse,\ndisturbed childhood, and socio-economic deprivation.\n\u2022When considering an offence  perpetrated by a person with mental disorder , one should bear in\nmind that, as with any offence, there is interplay between  the perpetrator , the victim, and the\nsituational circu mstances. Although mental disorder may play a part, it is rarely the only factor\nthat leads to an of fence.\nMental disorder and offending 2: specific disorders and offending\nSchizophrenia\nThe lifetime risk of violence in people with schizophrenia is about five times that in the general\npopulation.

Speci fic symptoms may be important but clearly are not enough in\nthemselves; otherwise virtually every person with schizophrenia would be violent. Threat control-\noverride sympt oms (delusion s regarding being threatened or being controlled) have been found\nto be associated with violence, but again, most patients with these symptoms are never violent.\nThe role of command auditory hallucinations is unclear . When people with psychosis are violent,\nthe victim is more likely to be known to them (particu larly relatives) than when violence is\ncommitted by non-psychotic individuals.\nDelusional disorders\nDelusional disorders are probably over-represented among patients detained in secure\npsychiatric hospitals; however , research on the associat ion between delusional disorders and\nviolence is difficult to interpret, as the samples are usually selective and uncontrolled, and in\nmany studies,  patients with delusional disorders are categorized with patients with other\npsychoses, especially schizo phrenia. \n  risk of violenc e has been reported to be associated with\npersecutory delusions, misidentification delusions, delusio ns of jealousy , delusions of love, and\nquerulous delusions. Jealousy may be dangerous, whether it is delusionally based or not. In\nsome cases, it is difficult to differentiate between premor bid personality disorder (perhaps with\nparanoid and/o r narcissistic features) and delusional disorder . The relevant beliefs are probably\nno less risky if they are over-valued ideas than if they are delusional.\nAffective disorders\nAffective disor ders have a far less strong relationship with offending and violence than\nschizophrenia. Mania commonly leads to minor offending due to grandiosity and disinhibition but\nrarely leads to serious violence or sexual assaults. Depression is very rarely associated with\nviolence or offending. Extend ed suicide (also known as altruistic homicide), in which a depressed\nparent (usuall y the father) kills members of their family before attempting, and perhaps\nsucceeding in, killing themselves, is extremely rare and impossible to predict. In some cases, it\noccurs in depressive psychosis associated with nihilistic delusions, but more commonly , there is\na histor y of marital breakdown in people who are depressed and suicidal but not psychotic. A\nhistorical association between shoplifting and depression  has been highlighted but is probably\ninsignificant.\nAlcohol- and drug-related disorders\nAlcohol- and drug-related problems are more strongly linked to offending and violence than any\nother mental disorders. A number of aspects of alcohol and substance misuse may be relevant\u2014\ndirect effects of intoxication or withdrawal; funding the habit; personal and social consequences\nof depe ndence; the neurops ychiatric sequel of prolonged  misuse; and the social context (peer\ngroup, socio-e conomic deprivation, childhood mistreatment); and personal characteristics\n(impulsivity and sensation seeking), which may lead to substance misuse, may also be\nassociated with of fending.\nPersonality disorders\nPersonality disorder is more strongly related to offending and violence than mental illness.\nPersonality-disordered offenders are heterogenous\u2014only a very small number are psychopathic\n(\n Psychopathy and \u2018severe\u2019 personality disorder , p. 524). Various aspects of personality\ndisorder may be related to offending: impulsivity , lack of empathy , poor affect regulation, paranoid\nthinking, poor relationships with others, and problems with anger and assertiveness.\nLearning disability\nOffending occu rs more often in people with milder forms of learning disability than in those with\nsevere learning disability . Offences are broadly similar to those in non-learning-disabled of fenders\nand are associated with family and social disadvantage.

Are normative values from an appropriate sample?\nCommunication  The assessment must be communicated in an appropriate and\nunderstandable way to others, including the patient . It must also be documented. Use of scores,\npercentages, or terms such as low , medium, or high should be explained.\nRisk management  The factors identified in the risk assessment should indicate areas to be\naddressed in management. They may point to the need for specific treatments (pharmacological\nor psychological), supervision, support, detention, or victim safety planning.\nScenario planning  Despite  best efforts, subsequent violence still occurs. Risk scenarios make\nthe final bridge to risk management and are a project ion about what could  happen, not a\nprediction of what will happen. Consider repeat of fence scenario, optimistic scenario (less serious\nact), pessimistic scenario (more serious act), and a \u2018twist\u2019 scenario (nature of violence changes,\ne.g. dif ferent type of victim).\nSecure hospitals and units\nWithin the health service, there are psychiatric hospitals and units that offer varying degrees of\nsecurity .10 The terms high, medium, and low security are used to categorize these services and\ngive some indication of the level of risk that can be managed within a particular unit. However ,\nthere are no clear definitions of these levels of security . Different units at the same security level\nmay operate in very different ways; there is blurring betwe en the different levels, and rather than\nthinking of patients in terms of the level of security required, it is better to consider a particular\npatient\u2019 s risk, how this should be managed, and how a particular unit may or may not be able to\nmanage the risk. The networ k of secure services for a particular area varies considerably from\nregion to region.\nSecurity does not just rely on the physical barriers and monitoring, although these are\nimportant. Knowing patients well (from studying their backgrounds and interacting with them) and\ndeveloping good relationships with them contribute to \u2018relational security\u2019. Security is also\nmaintained through the procedures set out to manage the environment (e.g. procedure for\naccessing different activities ). It is important to recogniz e that security is maintained through\nthese three concepts: relatio nal, procedural, and environmental security .

Patients may move on to low-security units, open wards, or\nthe community , being managed by general or forensic services, depending on local service\nprovision, patients\u2019 backgrounds, and clinical needs.\nSome speciali st units have been developed for personality-disordered patients, learning-\ndisabled patients, women, and adolescents. The State Hospital (Carstairs) and the Central\nMental Hospital (Dundrum) admit many patients who would have been admitted to medium-\nsecurity units in England and Wales, due to differences in the development of local secure\nforensic provision in Scotland, NI, and the RoI.\nLow-security units\nLow-security units and wards have locked doors but do not usually have a secure perimeter .\nSome regional  forensic services have a combination of low- and medium-security wards; in areas\nof Scotland and NI, there are low-security forensic wards without medium-security units. IPCUs\nare low-security short-stay wards, primarily for the care of acutely disturbed general psychiatry\npatients. In a few areas, they also take patients from courts, prisons, and more secure units, but\nthey are not well suited to providing longer-term assessment or treatment.\nProgression through levels of security\nPatients in secure settings progress through a rehabilitatio n programme, and their security needs\nare not static. The level of security should be reviewed regularly , and the patient transferred to a\nfacility providin g the necessary level of security when this is appropriate.

These schemes may\nalso be known as police or court liaison schemes .\n\u2022 Police or court liaison  is the process or system by which mental health services provide\nassessment and/or diversion for people with mental disorder at an early stage of the criminal\njustice process.\nIn many  cases where a person is diverted, the police, prosecutor , or court will discontinue the\ncriminal justice process. This will be particularly appropria te in most cases where individuals with\nmental disorder will have committed relatively minor offences. However , diversion does not\nnecessitate this, and where appropriate, particularly where more serious offences have been\ncommitted, a prosecution may be pursued, in parallel with diversion for care and treatment.\nPowers allowing the police to take a person to a place of safety\n\u2022The police have powers unde r mental health legislation to convey a person whom they believe\nis suf fering from mental disorder to a place of safety . (Specific powers are set out in Box 16.4 .)\n\u2022The purpose of these powers is to allow for a psychiatric assessment.\n\u2022Use by the police of these powers does not oblige mental health services to admit the person.\nArrest and detention in custody\nWhere an offence has been committed, a mentally disordered offender may be arrested and\ntaken into police custody .\n\u2022Issues to address when assessing a person in custody :\n\u2022Is there evidence of mental disorder?\n\u2022Is treatment in hospital required?

A person may be unfit to remain in police custody due to\nphysical illness or mental disorder . Where a person is mentally disordered, such that there\nwould be a serious immediate risk to their own health if they remained in the police cells, then\nthey would be unfit to remain in police custody and should usually be admitted to hospital.

If the application is granted , the garda must remove the person\nto the approved centre.\nNote:  in England and Wales, Scotland, and NI, these powers do not allow the police to enter premises if they want to remove a\nperson who appears to be suffering from a mental disorder .

Appropriate adult schemes operate differently in the\ndifferent jurisdictions of the British Isles (\n  Appropriate adults , p. 754).\n\u2022False confessions  have been at the heart of some notorious miscarriages of justice.

This is\nthe eleventh highest rate of incarceration among Europ ean jurisdictions, and the highest rate\namong western  European jurisdictions. Scotland had the twelfth highest rate, with 145 prisoners\nper 100,000, and NI was lower with a rate of 98 prisoners per 100,000 (ranked twenty-second).\nPrison populations continue to grow .15,16,17 Prisons in the UK are either local prisons\n(accommodating remand prisoners and prisoners serving sentences of <2yrs) or training prisons\n(taking prisoners serving sentences of >2yrs). In practice, a number of prisons perform both\nfunctions. Security varies, depending on the categories of prisoners held. All prisoners are\ncategorized solely on security considerations\u2014\u2018A \u2019 (the highest category , requiring maximum\nsecurity) to \u2018D\u2019 (the lowest category , suitable for open conditions). Most \u2640 prisoners are kept in\nseparate prisons.\nThe prison remand\nA person accused of committing an offence may be held on remand in prison, while awaiting trial\nand/or sentence. Courts should not remand a person in custody , unless there is a good reason\nnot to grant bail. Mentally disordered offenders are more likely to be remanded in custody than\nother offenders, perhaps because: they are more likely to be homeless; they are considered less\nlikely to comply with bail; they are perceived as more dangerous because of their mental\ndisorder; there are a number of statutory objections to bail for mentally disordered defendants,\neven where the offence is not punishable by imprisonment; and even though remands in custody\nfor reports are discouraged, there is a lack of hospital or specialist bail facilities.\nThe prison sentence\nA prison sentence is imposed on an offender by a judge. He will consider a number of factors,\nincluding any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The sentence may serve one or more of\nthe following functions: punishment, deterrence, reparatio n, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. In\ncertain circum stances, there may be a mandatory priso n sentence (e.g. a life sentence for\nmurder). Most  prisoners serving determinate sentences are released before the end of their\nsentence and subject to a period of supervision and/or recall. The exact nature of this depends\non the nature of the offence and the length of the sentence imposed, as well as progress within\nthe prison. Life-sentenced prisoners have a tariff (minimu m time to serve as punishment) set by\nthe judge. Following the end of the tariff period, the parole board may authorize the release of the\nprisoner on \u2018life licence\u2019. They are subject to recall to priso n, should they breach their parole\nconditions. Following a legal  challenge, the UK Home Secretary has lost the power to set the\ntariff for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, althoug h the Attorney General has the power\nto petition the Court of Appeal to increase any prison terms which are seen as unduly lenient.\nThe legality of \u2018whole-life orders\u2019 (i.e. where the prisoner is sentenced to die in jail) has previously\nbeen challenge d in the Europ ean Court of Human Rights. These orders were found to be legal,\nas the Home Secretary in exceptional circumstances can review them. In Scotland, an Order of\nLife-Long Restriction can be added to the sentence of an individual who is felt to pose a\nsignificant risk to the general  public. In practice, this means that an extensive risk management\nplan must be developed before a prisoner can receive parole, often resulting in the prisoner\nspending longer in prison.\nMental disorder in prisoners\nThe prevalence of mental disorder in the prison population is high, in comparison with the general\npopulation, with some estima tes as high as 90% when drug and alcohol problems are included."

It has been estimated that 23\u201355% of prisoners have psychiatric\ntreatment needs, with 2\u20135% requiring transfer to a psychiatric hospital.\nMental health services in prison\nTraditionally , the prison health service has been separate from the mainstream health service.\nBetween 2008  and 2013, the responsibility for providing healthcare in prisons was passed to the\nNHS in England, Wales, Scotland, and NI. This was in response to findings that healthcare\navailable in prisons was poorer than that available to the general population. Prison psychiatry is\nnow provided by private providers, contracted by the NHS, or NHS psychiatrists working within\nthe prison (normally 1\u20132 sessions per week). There are normally psychiatric nurses based within\nthe prison, and NHS psychologists also provide input. Access to treatment remains a significant\nconcern.\nA limited health screen occurs on reception to prison, and prisoners can be identified as having\nmental health needs. Prisoners can request reviews and can also be referred by prison staff if\nthere are concerns.\nPrison psychiatry 2: the role of the psychiatrist\nPsychiatrists may be asked to assess prisoners for the following reasons:18\n\u2022To provide court reports (\n  Court reports and giving evidence 1 , p. 764).\n\u2022To provide assessment and treatment, as part of the NHS team providing healthcare.\n\u2022For statutory purposes (e.g. preparing reports for the parole board).\nNormally routine appointments will be in the prison healthcare centre (similar to an outpatient\ndepartment). For other conta ct (court or parole reports), a specific arrangement will be made.\nWhen arranging to see a prisoner , a psychiatrist should make an appointment that will fit in with\nthe prison routine. There will be usually only 2\u20133hrs in the morning or afternoon when there is\naccess to prisoners. The psychiatrist will have to wait to be escorted by prison staf f.\nAssessment of prisoners\nPrisoners should be seen on their own, unless prison staff or other sources indicate this would be\nunwise. It may be difficult to get relevant information abou t the prisoner \u2019s day-to-day functioning\nand presentation from prison staff, although attempts should be made to do this. Ask the prisoner\nfor a relative\u2019 s telephone number and permission to speak to them. The prison medical file may\nnot contain all the necessary information, and in some cases, other prison records should be\nexamined. History-taking, MSE, and information gathering should proceed as with any other\npsychiatric assessment.\nOptions in the management of mentally disordered prisoners\nIf a psychiatrist assesses a prisoner and finds that they are mentally disordered, he may:\n\u2022Treat the person in prison.\n\u2022Arrange for the person to be transferred to mental health services, either by arranging direct\ntransfer from prison (\n Overview of the pathways of mentally disorered offenders through the\ncriminal justice and health systems , p. 772) or by recommending a mental health disposal\nthrough the courts if the prisoner has not been sentenced yet.\nNo priso n, or prison medical centre, is recognized as a hospital under mental health legislation;\ntherefore, compulsory treatment under the MHA cannot be given. All prisoners with severe\nmental illness should be transferred to hospital for treatment. Legal provisions for transferring\nprisoners to hospital are set out on \n  Legal provision s for transfer of prisoners to hospital , p.\n762. Similar provis ions for remand prisoners are discussed in \n  Overview of the pathways of\nmentally disore red offenders through the criminal justice and health systems , p. 770 and listed in\nTable 16.3  for each jurisdiction."

These are run by the prison service and do not involve mental health services.\nProgrammes are available for areas such as sexual offending, anger management, alcohol and\nsubstance misuse, and problem-solving.\n\u2022Some prisons specialize in treating certain mentally disordered prisoners, e.g. HMP Grendon in\nEngland offers therapeutic community treatment for personality-disordered prisoners who\nvolunteer to be transferred there; there is a 17-bed psychiatric unit at HMP Maghaberry in NI.\nPrescribing in prison\nPrescribing in prison should be similar to prescribing in the community\u2014with some additional\nconsiderations. In the prison environment, there can be additional barriers to compliance, with\nmedication being diverted (stolen or sold). Mental health patients can be bullied for medication.\nConsideration should be given to the \u2018street value\u2019 of medication when prescribing. Medication\ncan be \u2018supervised\u2019, meaning it is dispensed daily or \u2018in possession\u2019, i.e. the prisoner is given a\nsmall supply of medication (usually weekly or monthly). Supervised medication increases\ncompliance. The form of medication should also be considered\u2014orodispersible or liquid\nmedications increase compliance and reduce the risk of diversion.\nSuicide in prison\nSuicide is the most common mode of death in prisons. There are ~600 episodes of self-harm and\none suicide per week in priso ns in England and Wales. \u2642 prisoners have a 3\u20136 times greater risk\nof suicide than those in the general population. The most common means is by hanging. Remand\nprisoners, young offenders, and those with a history of substance misuse and violent offences\nare at particular risk.\nMany factors probably contribute to the \n  rate of suicide in prisons, including: history of\npsychiatric disorder , previous self-harm, alcohol and substance misuse, and social isolation.\nCompounded by uncertainty , powerlessness, bullying, and isolation.\nThe task of identifying prisoners who are at risk is extremely difficult, as those who kill\nthemselves share the same vulnerabilities and stresses with many other prisoners who do not. A\nmajor factor that may reduce suicide rates is improvem ent in prison conditions. Isolation of\nprisoners at risk in strip cells still occurs, although it is becoming less frequent and is against\nofficial guidance.\nLegal provisions for transfer of prisoners to hospital\nSentenced prisoners\nEngland and W ales\nSection 47 MHA 1983 (as a mended)  allows for the transfer of a mentally disordered sentenced\nprisoner to hospital. There must be reports from two registered medical practitioners addressing\nwhat category of mental disorder the person suffers from and whether this is of a nature or\ndegree to warrant hospital detention. The reports are submitted to the Secretary of State who\ndecides whether or not to grant a \u2018transfer direction\u2019.\nSection 49 MHA 1983 (as amended)  allows  the Secretary of State to add a \u2018restriction\ndirection\u2019 to a transfer direction, which has the same effect as a restriction order under Section 41\nand may last as long as the sentence the person was serving.

What is the relationship between\nany psychiatric disorder and past, present, and future offending? How might treatment or the\nnatural course  of the disorde r impact on the likelihood of further offending? What impact might\nthe current mental state have on the person\u2019 s ability to participate in the court process?\nThe legal issues  The request for psychiatric  assessment should indicate the legal issues\ntowards which  the psychiatrist should direct the assessment. However , in many cases, the\ninstructions are not specific. The main issues to consider are usually:\n\u2022Fitness to plead (\n  Fitness to plead 1: assessment , p. 774).\n\u2022Responsibility (\n  Criminal responsibility 1 , p. 778).\n\u2022The presence of mental disorder and whether assessment and/or treatment under compulsion\n(or otherwise) is required (\n  Mental disorder and of fending 1: overview , p. 745).\n\u2022The risk the person poses (may be relevant in whethe r a restriction order is imposed, in\ndetermining if disposal should be to a secure unit or a special hospital, or perhaps in\ndetermining the nature of the sentence imposed; \n  Assessing risk of violence , p. 748).\nBefore the interview\n\u2022Comprehensive background information should usually be provided by those requesting the\nreport. Unfortu nately , this is often lacking. Ideally , one should have the opportunity to examine:\nthe document specifying the charges, the police summ ary, witness statements, records of\ninterviews with the accused, records of previous offences, and other reports. Sometimes tape\nrecordings of interviews and photographic or video evidence may be available.\n\u2022Arrangements should be made to interview the person in prison (if they have been remanded in\ncustody), as an outpatient (if they have been remanded on bail), or in hospital (if they have\nbeen admitted to hospital). The psychiatrist should be given reasonable time to complete the\nassessment and produce a considered report. If there is insuf ficient time, then this should be\nstated in the report and any opinion given should be qualified.\nThe interview\n\u2022Check the person\u2019s correct name and details. Introduce yourself and state who has requested\nthe report.\n\u2022Make it clear that the interview is not confidential and that the information in the report will be\nseen by others.\n\u2022It is good practice and advisable to gain written consent from the person to access their health,\nprison, social work, or educational records.\n\u2022Clarify that the person has understood this, and seek their consent to prepare the report.\n\u2022If the person refuses to be interviewed, then this shoul d be respected and reported to the\nperson requesting the report.\n\u2022Ask the person\u2019 s permission to contact a relative and/or their GP for further information.\n\u2022Follow the usual format for a psychiatric assessment.\n\u2022Enquiry about the circumstances of the offence, and the person\u2019 s understanding of the court\nprocess will need to be made in addition.\n\u2022More than one session may be necessary in some cases.\n\u2022Physical examination and investigations should be performed, if indicated.\nAfter the interview\nFurther information may be gathered from the following sources:\n\u2022Interviews with relatives or staf f (healthcare, prison, or social services).\n\u2022Health (psychiatric or general practice), prison, social work, or educational records."

A\nrecommendation that an individual is unfit to plead should be reserved for cases where this is\nbeyond doubt.  In borderline cases, certain measures (such as a hospital remand) may allow\nfurther assessment and treatment to clarify the issue. Where the index offence is relatively minor ,\nit may be appropriate for charges to be dropped and for civil detention to be initiated. In such\ncases, prosecutors are usually keen to take this course.\nFitness to plead 2: procedures\nWhat happens after a person is found unfit to plead?\nA person who is unfit to plead may not be subject to penal sanctions. Traditionally , the person\nwould be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital, with special restrictions on discharge, until\nthey recovered to the extent that they could be tried (although the person would rarely go back\nfor trial, even if they recovered!). This unsatisfactory arrangement is still the case in the RoI. In\nEngland and Wales, Scotland, and NI, following a finding of unfitness to plead, there is a trial of\nfacts where the court determines if the person did the act charged. If the facts are found, the\nperson may be subject to one of a range of mental health disposals, depending on their mental\nstate, their needs, and the risk they might pose.\nProceedings following a finding\nEngland and W ales\n\u2022Proceedings set out in the Criminal Procedure (Insanity  and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1964\n(amended 1991, 2004).\n\u2022Following a finding of unfitne ss to plead, there is a trial of facts  held to determ ine whether , on\nthe balance of probability , it is likely that the person committed the of fence.\n\u2022If this is not found to be the case, the defendant is discharged; if it is found to be the case, the\nperson may be subject to one of the following disposals:\n\u2022Hospital order (almost identical to Section 37 MHA 1983).\n\u2022Hospital order with a restrict ion order (almost identical to Section 37 and Section 41 MHA\n1983).\n\u2022Guardian order (almost identical to Section 37 MHA 1983).\n\u2022Supervision and treatment order (similar to a psychiatric probation order).\n\u2022No order .\n\u2022If the person has been charged with murder , then there is a mandatory hospital order with an\nunlimited restriction order .\nScotland\n\u2022Proceedings set out under Section 54 to 57 CP(S)A 1995, as amended by Criminal Justice and\nLicensing (Scotland) Act 2010.\n\u2022Following a finding of unfitness for trial , there is an \u2018examination of facts\u2019.\n\u2022While awaiting this, the person may be placed in prison, on bail, or in hospital under a\ntemporary compulsion order .\n\u2022At the \u2018examin ation of facts\u2019, a determination is made as to whether , on the balance of\nprobability , it is likely that the person committed the of fence.\n\u2022If this is not found to be the case, the defendant is discha rged (but may merit civil detention if\nremains menta lly unwell); if this is found to be the case, the person may be subject to one of\nthe following disposals:\n\u2022Compulsion order (almost identical to Section 57A CP(S)A 1995) in hospital or the\ncommunity .\n\u2022Compulsion order in hospital with a restriction order (almost identical to Section 57A and\nSection 59 CP(S)A 1995)."

Unfortunately , the\ndefinition of ID (defined as \u2018idiots\u2019, \u2018imbeciles\u2019, and the \u2018feeble-\nminded\u2019) was related to subjective measures, such as the \u2018ability to\ncare for oneself \u2019, rather than objective measures such as\nintelligence. This led to abuses such as other \u2018deviant behaviours\u2019\n(e.g. having an illegitimate child, habitual drunkenness) being used\nas grounds for committal to an institution. In addition, the institutions\nbecame focuse s for contemporary social concerns, by scapegoating\nthe \u2018feeble-min ded\u2019 as the cause of everything, from social problems\n(e.g. poverty , alcoholism, unemployment, promiscuity , illegitimacy) to\nimperial, and even racial, decline.\nProgress was gradually made in the use of more objective\nassessment of \u2018defectives\u2019, but most medical authoritie s believed"

This fed directly into\nprevalent eugenic notions of preventing \u2018racial decline\u2019 by\nsegregation, with physical stigmata (e.g. facial characteristics) seen\nas \u2018proof \u2019 that appearance (especially \u2018racial characteri stics\u2019) and\nmental health were interrelated. Nowadays, such ideas seem\nsimplistic (like the practice of phrenology at the time), but the notion\nthat the Caucasian races were \u2018more civilized\u2019 had significant\ninfluence at the beginning of the twentieth century . Some doctors\neven advocated compulsory sterilization \u2018to protect social health, but\npermit liberty\u2019. It would take decades, and two World Wars, before\nsocial, political, and scientific pressure finally dismantled these firmly\nheld ideas.\nImpetus for change came from growing concerns about the effects\nof large institutions, the forms of treatment, and the rights of those\nwith ID. In the 1960s, official enquiries found evidence of abuse,\nmalpractice, and neglect. Alarm among social reformers about the\nconditions in institutions was fuelled by Erving Goffman\u2019 s Asylums .\nEfforts were made to reduce stigma by replacing older labels with\nless pejorative terms (e.g. \u2018mental subnormality\u2019, \u2018mental retardation\u2019,\nand \u2018mental handicap\u2019 for \u2018mental deficiency\u2019; \u2018idiot\u2019, \u2018imbecile\u2019,\n\u2018trisomy 21\u2019, or \u2018Down\u2019 s syndrome\u2019 for \u2018mongolism\u2019; \u2018congenital\nhypothyroidism\u2019 for \u2018cretinism\u2019). In 1968, ICD-8 (WHO)  classified\n\u2018mental retard ation\u2019 according to the severity  of intellectual\nimpairment (by IQ assessment) and social factors. The 1970s and\n1980s saw major policy changes, emphasizing integration with\nmainstream resources and education, away from institutions and to\nthe community . Many people with ID moved from hospitals to\npurpose-built hostels or \u2018group homes\u2019.\nUnderstanding of the aetiolo gy of ID expanded from the 1950s\nonwards, with Lionel Penrose\u2019 s Biology of Mental Defect  in 1949  and\nthe discovery of the genetic basis of Down\u2019 s syndrome by J\u00e9r\u00f4me\nLejeune in 1959. By the 1970s, most standard textbooks recognized\nmultiple aetiol ogies (genetic  and environmental), separ ating pre-,\nperi-, and postnatal cause s. Karyotyping, identifying metabolic\nabnormalities, and isolating infectious agents allowed for laboratory\ndiagnoses, rather than reliance on clinical observation.\nPharmacological treatments of epilepsy , behavioural disturbance,"

The majority of patients live either in their own\nhomes or in a small community placement with paid carers. While\nthis has undoubted benefits when compared to the large,\nanonymous institutions, it has created an entirely new set of\nchallenges and problems. Some patients miss the social aspects of\nthe group setting and are frustrated that the only people with whom\nthey have contact are paid carers/support workers. The design of\ncare provision has come a long way, but there will always be a need\nto keep on improving.\nThe clinical terms used to refer to individuals with ID have\nchanged over the years, as formerly neutral terms have acquired\npejorative connotations and been replaced. When DSM-5 was\npublished, it used the term \u2018intellectual disability\u2019, rather than \u2018mental\nretardation\u2019 (see Box 17.1).

It aims to establish disability as something that can occur\nin everyone to some degree, rather than being something\nstigmatizing.\nThe ICF describes disability and functioning as umbrella terms\ndenoting the positive and negative aspects of functioning from a\nbiological, individual, and social perspective. Functioning is regarded\nas the dynamic interaction between a person\u2019 s health condition,\nenvironmental (external) factors, and personal (internal) factors, and\nICF organizes this informa tion in two parts.

Following this separation, a\nnumber of practitioners remained within the general hospitals with a\nspecial interest in \u2018nervous disorders\u2019, working at the boundary\nbetween neurology and psychiatry . At that time, the distinction\nbetween the two specialties was not as clear as it later became.\nAs neurological practice became more scientific, the role of\npsychological factors became  less an object of clinical attention for\nneurologists. At the same time, psychoanalytic theories were pre-\neminent within psychiatry , and interest in, and involvement with,\norganic illnesses declined. However , by the early twentieth century ,\nthere was increasing attention to psychosomatic factors in the\naetiology and maintenance of disease and their role in recovery .\nWith the onset of \u2018biological psychiatry\u2019 in the mid-twentieth century ,\na number of pioneering individuals began psychiatric practice within\nthe general hospitals. They advocated the need for recognition and\ntreatment of psychological factors in physical illness and began the\nprocess of establishing links with medical colleagues, identifying\nappropriate cases for intervention and gaining funding for service\ndevelopment and research.\nThe development of the subspecialty was motivated by the low\nrate of outsid e referrals in proportion to the prevalence of the\ndisorders in the medical population and increasing medical\nspecialization, leading to a lack of confidence and competence with\npsychiatric/psychological problems in physicians and surgeons. By\nthe 1970s, a distinct subspecialty was recognized in both the UK and\nthe USA. It was staffed mainly by sole practitioners who were\ngenerally confined to the larger hospitals. They developed services\nand established models and ways of working and, in particular ,\ndeveloped links with individual departments with particular needs. In\nthe last quarter-century , there has been growth in both role and\npractitioner numbers. This growth has often been service-led, with"

We are currently at an early\nstage of our understanding of medically unexplained illnesses. While\nno specialty has all the answ ers in the management of this patient\ngroup, psychiatry can offer: experience of the presentation of MUS\nacross the hospital specialti es; the ability to assess and treat the\nfrequently comorbid depressive/anxiety symptoms; and a tolerance\nfor diagnostic uncertainty and the ability to take a long-term view of\nimprovements.\nMisdiagnosis  A frequently expressed concern doctors hold about\nthis group of patients is the risk of \u2018getting it wrong\u2019 (often associated\nwith poorly formed worries about litigation). A long-held belief was\nthat, despite repeated negative findings, all such patients (or a\nmajority) would eventually be found to suf fer from an organic disease\nwhich would, in retrospect, account for their symptoms. This concern\nwas largely based on older , poorly conducted studies with significant\nmethodological flaws. Recent follow-up studies sugges t that the\nmisdiagnosis rate for functional illness is ~5% (e.g. comparable to\nother medical and psychiatric diagnoses such as idiopathic epilepsy\nand schizophrenia).

The desire to become physically\ndisabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by:\n\u2022The preoccupation with the desire (including time spent\npretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with\nproductivity , leisure activitie s, or social functioning (e.g. the\nperson is unwilling to have a close relationship because it would\nmake it dif ficult to pretend).\n\u2022Attempts to actually become disabled, resulting in the person\nputting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy (e.g. lying\non a railway track to amputate a limb).\n\u2022Surgical interventions being sought (and even agreed to), e.g.\nfor an amputation or for transection of the spinal cord.\nThe nature of this disorder is disputed, with sufferers of BID\nexplaining the desire for amputation as analogous to the desire of\ntranssexuals for surgical sex reassignment or other more extreme\nforms of body modifications. There is some functional brain\nimaging evidence suggesting it is a disorder of body image , similar\nto neglect in stroke patients, with loss of insight (hence it is a form\nof neuropsychiatric disorder).

They should be seen as soon as possible\nafter presentation, as encephalopathy may develop as their condition\nworsens.

The subsequent development of\npsychoanalysis was prompted by the case of Anna O, treated by\nBreuer betwee n 1880 and 1882. This patient, a 21-yr-old woman\n(real name Bertha Pappenheim), presented with a range of\nhysterical symptoms, including paralysis, visual loss, cough, and\nabrupt personality change.

Breuer also noted that not only did\nthe symptoms recur after the sessions ended, but that after he\nterminated the treatment relationship, she also suffered a full-blown\nrelapse.

            "Text": "T opographical model of the mind  In The Interpretation of Dreams ,\nFreud theorize d that the mind consisted of the unconscious, the\npreconscious, and the conscious. Only those ideas and memories in\nthe conscious mind are within awareness. The preconscious\ncontains those ideas and memories capable of entering the\nconscious mind. The preconscious performs a \u2018censorship\u2019 function\nby examining these ideas and memories and sending those which\nare unacceptable back to the unconscious (\u2018repression\u2019). The\nunconscious mind acts according to the \u2018pleasure principle\u2019\u2014the\navoidance of pain and the seeking of gratification. This is modified by\nthe \u2018reality principle\u2019 of the conscious mind\u2014that gratification often\nmust be postponed in order to obtain other forms of pleasure.\nFreud\u2019 s psychoanalytic techniques would attempt to interpret\nunconscious content based on access to preconscious content such\nas free associations, the content of dreams, transference, jokes, and\n\u2018parapraxes\u2019 (\n  Examination of parapraxes , p. 899).\nStructural model of the mind  Freud  reconfigured the\ntopographical model  in light of his clinical experience. In the\nstructural model , an infant\u2019 s mind comprised  the id (\u2018the it\u2019, which\nwishes to pursue its own desires, regardless of the constraints of\nmorality or external reality) which is entirely unconsciou s. As time\ngoes on and development occurs, the mind further differentiates into\nthe ego and then the superego. The ego (\u2018the me\u2019) is mostly\nconscious, emerges during infancy , and is the part of the personality\nwhich negotiates between the \u2018three harsh masters\u2019: the desires of\nthe id, the hold of reality , and the superego. The superego (the\n\u2018conscience\u2019) is the conscious and unconscious internalization of the\nmorals and strictures of parents and society , which provides\njudgements on which behavi ours are acceptable and which are not.\nWhen the ego is unable to successfully moderate between the id and\nsuperego, it may defend the individual\u2019 s sense of self by repressing\nthe impulse to the unconscious where its presence may produce\ndisturbance. Alternatively , the ego may be tormented by an over-\nharsh superego.\nDrive theory  Freud postulated the existence of basic drives,\nwhich included the \u2018libido\u2019, the sexual drive (\n Psychosexual\ndevelopment , p. 894), which  made up part of \u2018eros\u2019, the life drive, in"

Obje ct relations theory remains significant in modern\npsychoanalytical practice.\nEssence  Our \u2018sense of self\u2019 and our adult personality are\ndeveloped as a result of the relationships we form in our lives. The\nearliest, and hence the most important, relationship is that between\nmother and child. Our early relationships form a template  for future\nrelationships, with abnormal early experiences being asso ciated with\npsychological symptoms and abnormal relationships later in life.\nTheory  The mind is viewed as blank at birth, with the newbor n\nunable to distinguish between \u2018myself \u2019 and \u2018everything else\u2019. Then\nthe infant begins to view the external world as a series of (initially\nunconnected) \u2018objects\u2019. These objects may be things (e.g. a toy, a\nblanket), people (e.g. mothe r, father), or parts of people or things\n(e.g. the mother \u2019s breast, the mother \u2019s face). The infant creates an\ninternal representation of each object and has relationship s with, and\nfeelings towards, the internal, as well as the external, objects.\nThere are three primitive emotions (or \u2018affects\u2019) which an infant\ncan display towards each object: attachment, frustra tion, and\nrejection. There is a tendency for a single affect to become\nassociated with one object.  Inevitably , even a caring mother will\ncreate some feelings of frustration and rejection\u2014mothers comfort\ntheir children and provide food and love, but also scold, punish and\nare sometimes simply unable to meet their child\u2019 s needs.\nConsequently , the child will view the mother as comprising a number\nof objects, some of which he views positively and some with hostility .\nThe child will initially deal with this by keeping the \u2018good objects\u2019\n(associated with attachment) separate from the \u2018bad objects\u2019 (those\ncausing frustration and rejection)\u2014a phenomenon known as\n\u2018splitting\u2019. This is the initial primitive defence mechanism\u2014the\n\u2018paranoid\u2013schizoid position\u2019.

The three mainstays of analyst\u2013analysand\ninteraction are enquiry , clarification, and interpretation.\nFree association \u2014the patient agrees to reveal everything which\ncomes to mind, no matter how embarrassing or socially\nunacceptable (i.e. \u2018speaking without selfcensorship\u2019).

The aim is\nto help the client or patient find their own solutions to problems, while\nbeing supported to do so and being guided by appropriate advice.

There is clearly an overlap in the\nmethods and skills of a psychotherapist and a counsellor .

There are a variety of counsellin g services\nin the voluntary and private sectors, some directed towards specific\nproblems and some more general.\nRationale\nBehaviour and emotional life are shaped by previous experience, the\ncurrent environment, and the relationships the individual has. Many\nlife problems can be viewed as arising from resolvable difficulties in\none of these three areas, rather than as an \u2018illness\u2019.

It\nsubstantially elaborates the concept of schemata (early self-\ndefeating patterns of perception, emotion, and behaviour),\nmaladaptive coping styles (e.g. over-compensation, avoidance, or\nsurrender), and modes (clusters of schemata and coping styles, e.g.\nchild modes, dysfunctional coping modes, dysfunctional parent\nmodes, and healthy adult mode), which are thought to arise when\nbasic emotiona l needs are not met in childhood (e.g. connection,\nmutuality , reciprocity , flow, and autonomy). In therapy , the goal is to\nrecognize dysfunctional modes of functioning and to have behaviour\nguided by the healthy adult mode. This is done through the use of a\nvariety of methods, including standard cognitive technique s, schema\ndiaries, flash cards, use of guided imagery , and \u2018chair work\u2019 (to enact\ndialogues between modes of behaviour , to reach closure with\nimagined \u2018significant others\u2019  through monologue, and to practice\nnormal assertiveness).

There are five broad areas of law of interest to psychiatrists: (1) common law as\nit relates to medical treatmen t decisions; (2) the law relating to incapable adults; (3) the\nlaw regulating the treatment of patients with mental disorder; (4) laws and regulations\nrelating to confidentiality; and (5) the criminal law in relation to mentally disordered\noffenders.\nIn this book, the subjects of criminal law and mentally disordered offenders are dealt\nwith in \n  Chapter 16. The remaining topics are covered within this chapter . As has\nbeen noted in the chapter on forensic issues, law is both parochial and dynamic. The\nlast two decades have seen  significant changes in the laws relating to psychiatric\npractice, and further changes  are likely over the decade to come. The current mental\nhealth and incapacity legisla tion covering the four legal jurisdictions within the British\nIsles is summarized in Box 20.1 ."

            "Text": "Although it is useful to have access to the relevant statute law, it is impossible to get\na good understanding of how the law works in practice through reading the texts of the\nlegislation. This develops through training, experience, and discussion with colleagues.\nThe trainee psychiatrist shou ld be aware of the current laws in their jurisdiction which\naffect their current area of practice. They should aim to have detailed knowledge of the\nparts of the legislation used day-to-day , and particularly in emergency situations.\nAlongside the Acts themselves, codes of practice and guidance notes are available\nthat give practical advice on the use of the Acts. Beyond these, the trainee should\nknow where to go for further information and advice (e.g. senior colleagues, hospital\nlegal office, commissions). They should be wary of mental health \u2018lore\u2019. Much\nmisinformation about legislation is promulgated without reference to what is actually\ncorrect. For example, some believe that UK legislation does not permit the detention of\nsomeone who is drunk, even if they are also depressed or acutely psychotic.\nIt is important to remember that the law often cannot resolve clinical dilemmas. For\nexample, if a detained patien t takes an OD, mental health legislation cannot be used to\nimpose physica l treatment. This does not mean that you can do nothing, knowing that\nyou are acting (or not acting) legally . In this situation, common law may allow , and\nmedical ethics may dictate, that physical treatment be imposed.\nBox 20.1 Legislation across the British Isles\nEngland and W ales\nCare and treatment of patients with mental disorder is regulated by the Mental Health\nAct 1983. Following failed attempts to produce a completely updated Act, the\nWestminster Parliament passed the Mental Health Act 2007 in July 2007. This\namends the 1983 Act in seve ral important areas. The majority of its provisions will be\nenacted between October 2007 and October 2008. The Mental Capacity Act 2005,\nwhich regulates decision-making on behalf of incapable adults, was implemented in\n2007.\nScotland\nThe Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 replaced the previous\nMental Health  (Scotland) Act 1984 in October 2005. It was later amended by\nprovisions in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015. The Adults with Incapacity Act\n2000 consolidated and clarified the law relating to incapable adults, replacing a\nnumber of outdated legal instruments which had previously been used for the role.\nNorthern Ireland\nCare and treatment of patients with mental disorder are currently regulated by the\nMental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, amended by the Mental Health\n(Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. An independent and wide-ranging\nreview of mental health law was initiated in 2002 under the chairmanship of\nProfessor David Bamford. The resulting report was the basis for the Mental Capacity\nAct (Northern Ireland) 2016, which combines mental health and incapacity provisions\nin one statute. This Act was enacted in May 2016 but awaits implementation at the\ntime of writing.\nRepublic of Ireland"

The Assisted Decision-Making\n(Capacity) Act 2015 was enacted in December 2016 and is being gradually\nimplemented at the time of writing.\nThe development of mental health law\nMental health legislation in the UK has its origins in the eighteenth century , which saw\nthe passing of both the Vagrancy Law, allowing local magistrates to order the\nconfinement of the \u2018furiously mad and dangerous\u2019, and the Act for the Regulation of\nPrivate Madho uses which allowed for licensing and inspe ction of private asylums and\nrequired a medical certifica te of insanity before the confinement of \u2018non-pauper \u2019\npatients. The former law primarily arose out of concerns about the risk posed to the\ngeneral public by the mentally ill\u2014the latter from concern to protect the interests of\nvulnerable patients.\nThe Lunacy Act of 1890 gave magistrates authority to detain \u2018lunatics, idiots, and\npersons of unsound mind\u2019 within private asylums. The Mental Deficiency Act 1913\nexpanded and clarified these powers but also expanded  the role of the state in the\nregulation and supervision of the care of the mentally disordered by reorganizing the\nVictorian Lunacy Commission as the Board of Cont rol for Asylums. This was\nestablished as a department of central government with powers to inspect asylums,\nreview compulsory detention, investigate complaints about treatment of patients, and\nmonitor the working of compulsory measures.\nIn 1926, the Royal Commiss ion on Lunacy and Mental Disorders produced a report\nwhich led to the Mental Treatment Act 1930. This Act was based on a view of mental\ndisorders as similar to medical illness and envisaged treatment and rehabilitation,\nrather than preventative detention, as the goal of admiss ion to hospital. It allowed for\noutpatient work  by medical staff in mental hospitals and, for the first time, provided for\nvoluntary treatment in hospital.\nIn 1957, the report of the Royal Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness\nand Mental Deficiency (the Percy Report) was published. The Commission\nrecommended that: \u2018the law should be altered so that whenever possible suitable care\nmay be provid ed for mentally disordered patients with no more restriction of liberty or\nlegal formality than is applie d to people who need care because of other types of\nillness\u2019 and noted that: \u2018the majority of mentally ill patients  do not need to be admitted\nto hospital as inpatients\u2019. The subsequent Mental Health Act (1959) allowed most\npsychiatric admissions to occur voluntarily and changed the procedure for compulsory\ndetention in hospital from a judicial to an administrative process. The Percy Report\nmarked the turning point in official policy , from hospital -based to community-based\nsystems of care.\nIn England and Wales, the Mental Health Act 1983 narrowed the definitions of\ncategories of mental disorder , excluding certain categories of patients from compulsory\ntreatment. It also established regulations and safeguards governing treatment without\nconsent. Similar Acts were passed for Scotland in 1984 and for Northern Ireland in\n1986.\nAt the end of the twentieth century , the UK government established the Richardson\nCommittee to again review mental health legislation in England and Wales, and a draft"

This attracted widespread criticism for a perceived overemphasis\non public protection and under-emphasis on the rights  of individuals with mental\ndisorder , seeming to revers e progress made over the previous century . An Act\namending, rather than replacing, the 1983 Act was finally passed in 2007. In Scotland\nmeanwhile, in 1999, the newly re-established Scottish Parliament tasked the Millan\nCommittee with a wide-ranging review of Scotland\u2019 s mental health laws. Its report was\nthe basis for the complete replacement of the 1984 Act with the Mental Health (Care\nand Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. In NI, the Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland)\n2016 will, when fully enacted, replace the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986,\nas well as provide a legislative basis for incapacity law in the province.\nSince the turn of the century , a further innovation in mental health law has been the\npassage of Acts specifically covering the care and treatment of incapable patients\u2014in\nScotland in 2000, in England and Wales in 2005, the RoI in 2015, and NI in 2016. A\nfuture challenge for lawmake rs across the British Isles is the implementation of the\nrights specified in the European Convention of Human Rights and the United Nations\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into UK and Irish mental health\nlaw and incapacity law .\nConsent to treatment\nA fundamental principle of medical care is that treatment of a patient should be with\ntheir consent. A patient has a right to decide for them selves which treatments to\nundergo and which treatments to refuse. This right is retained, even where refusal of\ntreatment could result in death or significant deterioration  in health. In the majority of\ncases, doctors should treat their patients according to this principle; treatment without\nconsent (\n Treatment without consent , p. 938) is possible only in certain\ncircumstances, constrained by appropriate laws.\nV alidity of consent\nFor consent to be valid, the patient must have capacity  to make medical treatment\ndecisions, the consent must be informed (i.e. the patie nt has fully understood the\ndetails and implications of what is proposed), and it must be given freely (i.e. not given\nunder duress).\nCapacity to make treatment decisions\nCapacity is a legal concept, meaning the ability to enter into valid contracts. It is gained\non adulthood and is presumed to be present throughout the lifespan, unless\npermanently or temporarily lost. Under common law, there is a presumption of capacity\nin adults, i.e. it is to be assumed that an adult retains full capacity unless there is\nevidence that it has been lost. Assessments of capacity are made on the balance of\nprobabilities.\nCapacity is not an \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 quality , i.e. one may have capacity for some\ndecisions, but not others. Within incapacity law (\n Mental Capacity Act: England and\nWales, p. 942; \n Incapacity Act: Scotland , p. 944), capacity is divided into two broad\ncategories: capacity for financial decisions and capacity for personal welfare decisions.\nA patient\u2019 s capacity or incapacity should be judged in relation to the required decision,\nrather than being inferred from the presence of any mental illness or disability ."

The amount and\ntype of informa tion provided will depend on the nature of the condition, the complexity\nand risks of the proposed treatment, the clinical situation, and the patient\u2019 s own wishes.\nThe aim should be to provide the patient with a balance d and accurate view of their\ndiagnosis and prognosis, the nature and purpose of the proposed treatment, any\nalternative treatment options, and the likely risks and side effects, answering any\nquestions honestly and only withholding information if its disclosure would cause the\npatient serious harm.\nForms of consent\nConsent may be implied (i.e. the patient does not object to, and cooperates with, the\nprocedure) or may be expres s (i.e. oral or written permission is explicitly asked for and\nrecorded, often  on a detailed  consent form). Generally , express consent is obtained for\nnon-trivial or invasive proced ures, and for some interventions (e.g. operations), it is\nmandatory .\nAdvance statements\nSometimes, in cases where a patient has a progressive disease, although they\ncurrently lack capacity to consent or refuse treatment, they may have indicated, when\ngreater capacity existed, their treatment preferences in an advance statement\n(\u2018advance directive\u2019 or \u2018living will\u2019).

There are, however , situations where treatment can take place without\nconsent, and these situations (appropriately) have legal safeguards. There are four\nbroad areas where treatmen t may take place despite lack of consent: (1) treatment\nundertaken under common law; (2) treatment under the provisions of an Incapacity Act;\n(3) treatment under the provis ions of a Mental Health Act; and (4) treatment authorized\nby a court.\nFor psychiatrists, the majority of treatment decisions involving consideration of non-\nconsensual treatment will relate to psychiatric patients. However , in other fields of\nmedicine, situations may arise where decisions must be made regarding treatment\nwithout consent. Often a psychiatrist\u2019 s opinion will be sought because, by the nature of\ntheir work, most psychiatrists will have greater knowledge of, and familiarity with, legal\nissues than their medical counterparts. Also, a patient\u2019 s reasons for withholding\nconsent may be thought to be due to a (possibly undiagnosed) mental disorder . Where\nthis is the case, other profes sionals may not feel they have the clinical skills to make\nthis diagnosis.\nT reatment undertaken under common law\nAs noted in \n  Common law , p. 940, common law \u2018necessity\u2019 may provide a doctor with\na defence against assault where non-consensual treatment is given. There may be\nsituations, e.g. the use of sedation in a patient with acute behavioural disturbance\nwhere there is a suspected physical or psychiatric cause , when the doctor has to act\nagainst a patient\u2019 s wishes, in order to adequately carry out their duty of care.

In general, treatment of unrelated medical disorders cannot be authorized by\na Mental Health Act.\nT reatment authorized by a court\nIn a small number of cases, doctors will ask for a court\u2019 s decision regarding a decision\nto treat a patient without their consent. In general, these will be non-urgent, but\npotentially controversial, cases where statute law has no clear role and where there\ndoes not appea r to be any relevant legal precedent. Often  the judgements in these test\ncases become important subsequently in guiding the approach to similar cases.\nCommon law\nCommon law is that body of law which is derived from previous decisions of the courts,\nin contr ast with statute law\u2014which is law created by legislative bodies (e.g. regional,\nnational, and supranational parliaments). Common law can arise from:\n\u2022Long-established custom and practice.\n\u2022Clarification of the meaning and extent of statute by the courts.\n\u2022Statements of law by judges ruling on cases where no applicable law exists or fits\nprecisely .\nThe common law is dynami c and changes and expands as cases are heard and\njudgements are handed down. For this reason, it is impossible to be aware of all\npotentially applicable judgements. Doctors should make every effort to be up-to-date\nwith current debates and decisions within their own specialty . They should also seek\nclarification from senior colleagues, their hospital legal advisors, or their professional\nbodies in potentially contentious cases.\nCommon law principles for medical treatment decisions\n\u2022Act in accordance with the patient\u2019 s wishes:  a fundamental principle of the doctor\u2013\npatient relationship. Doctors should, in general, respect the patient\u2019 s autonomy in\ndecision-making, only acting against the patient\u2019 s wishes in very limited\ncircumstances.\n\u2022Presume capa city in adults:  a patient over the age of 16 is presumed to have\ncapacity to make treatment decisions, unless there is evidence to the contrary\n(assessed on the balance of probabilities).\n\u2022Apply \u2018reasonableness\u2019 test:  a frequ ently used consideration in law is the test of what\na hypothetical \u2018reasonable man\u2019 would do in the circumstances. For medical\ntreatment decisions, the test is what the \u2018reasonable doctor \u2019 would have done in\nthose circumstances.\n\u2022Act in the patie nt\u2019s \u2018best interests\u2019:  in emergency situations, it may not be possible to\nobtain consent (e.g. in an unconscious RTA victim requirin g drainage of an extradural\nhaematoma); here, it is accepted that the doctor \u2019s overriding duty is to preserve life.\n\u2022Doctrine of necessity:  \u2018necessity\u2019 provides a defence against a potential criminal\ncharge that you have assaulted a patient by giving non-consensual treatment.

This case centred on an individual\nwho, as a child, had suffered brain damage as a result of a cardiac arrest induced by\nrespiratory failure. The court\u2019 s finding was that, even if a body of professional opinion\nexisted which held that the action was reasonable, the defendant could still be\njudged negligent if the judge held the opinion that no logical basis for the opinion had\nbeen shown to the court.\nThe Ms B case4 As a result of a serious illness, a Ms B had been rendered\nparalysed and dependent on artificial ventilation for surviva l. She refused consent for\ncontinued ventilation, but in view of the inevitable fatal outcome, the hospital refused\nto acce pt her refusal. She was assessed by several cons ultant psychiatrists whose\nopinion was that she retaine d full capacity . She applied for a court decision where\nthe ruling was that once her capacity had been established, any further treatment\nwithout consen t was unlawful. The court also gave the opinion that should doctors\ntreating her feel unable to treat her in accordance with her wishes, they had a duty to\ntransfer her care to other doctors. Ms B was subsequently transferred to another\nhospital where, following withdrawal of artificial ventilation, she died."

Lack of\ncapacity is not to be presume d, based on a person\u2019 s age or appearance, on any aspect\nof their behaviour , or on any condition or disorder from which they suffer. The Act\nspecifies certa in decisions that cannot be made by one person on behalf of another .\nThese are: agreeing to marriage, civil partnership or divorce, consent to a sexual\nrelationship, and casting a ballot in an election.\nT echniques covered by the Act\nLasting powers of attorney (LPA) A person may appoint an attorney to act on their\nbehalf if they should lose capacity in the future.

            "Text": "Court-appointed deputies  The Act provides for a system of court-appointed deputie s.\nDeputies will be able to be appointed to take decisions on welfare, healthcare, and\nfinancial matte rs, as authorized by the new Court of Prote ction, but will not be able to\nrefuse consent to life-sustaining treatment. They will only be appointed if the court\ncannot make a one-of f decision to resolve the issues.\nAdvance decisions  The Act allow s patients to make an advance decision to refuse\ntreatment if they should lack capacity in the future. The Act sets out safeguards of\nvalidity and applicability in relation to advance decisions. An advance decision\nconcerning life-sustaining treatment must be in writing, signed, and witnessed, and\nthere must be an express statement that the decision stands \u2018even if life is at risk\u2019.\nProtection from liability when providing care and treatm ent to an incapable adult\nSection 5 of the Act authoriz es healthcare staff to carry out personal care, healthcare,\nand medical treatment in an incapable adult, without fear of liability . The care provider\nmust establish that the patient lacks capacity and that the proposed treatment is in their\nbest interest. If this is the case, then the care provider does not incur any liability in\nrelation to the Act that they would not have incurred if the adult had had capacity to\nconsent in relation to the matter and had consented to the treatment.\nBodies with powers under the Act\nCourt of Protection  This Court has jurisdiction relating to the whole Act. It has its own\nprocedures and nominated judges. It is able to make declarations, decisions, and\norders affecting people who lack capacity and make decisions for, or appoint, deputies\nto make decisions on beha lf of people lacking capacity . It deals with decisions\nconcerning both property and af fairs, as well as health and welfare decisions.\nThe Public Guardian  The Public Guardian has several duties under the Act and is\nsupported in carrying these out by an Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). The Public\nGuardian and his staff will be the registering authority for LPAs and deputies. They\nsupervise deputies appointed by the Court and provide information to help the Court\nmake decisions.\nDeprivation of Liberty Safeguards\nThe Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) are contained in an amendment to the\noriginal Act and provide addit ional protections where an individual is: \u2018under continuous\nsupervision and control and is not free to leave\u2019. They can be applied to individuals in a\nhospital or care home only; deprivation of liberty elsewhe re must be authorized by the\nCourt of Protection. An application for authorization is made to the Local Authority that\nwill appoint two trained asse ssors\u2014one mental health assessor (a doctor approved\nunder Section 12) and one \u2018best interests\u2019 assessor (often a social worker). They will\nconfirm that six tests are satisfied: the person is over 18yrs, they have a mental\ndisorder , they lack capacity , deprivation of liberty is in their best interests, MHA\ndetention is not current or preferable, and deprivation of liberty is not in conflict with\nother decision- making authority (e.g. a valid advance decision). DoLS allows for legal\nrepresentation, access to Independent Mental Capacity Advocates (IMCAs), and the\nright of appeal to the Court of Protection.\nIncapacity Act: Scotland"

            "Text": "The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 provides the legal framework regulating\nthose who make decisions on behalf of adults with impa ired capacity in Scotland. It\ncovers financial and personal  welfare decisions (which include decisions about medical\ntreatment). The Act applies to individuals over the age of 16yrs.\nPrinciples\nThose making decisions on behalf of another are required to take account of the\nfollowing fundamental principles, as in Section 1:\n\u2022Benefit \u2014any intervention in the affairs of an incapable adult must benefit the adult\nconcerned, and this benef it must not be reasonably achievable without the\nintervention.\n\u2022Least restrictive option \u2014any intervention must restrict the freedom of the adult as\nlittle as possible.\n\u2022Consider the adult\u2019 s wishes \u2014decisions made on behalf of an incapable adult must\ntake account of their currently and previously expressed wishes on the subject.\n\u2022Consultation with relevant others \u2014anyone making decisions  on behalf of an\nincapable adult must take account of the views of the adult\u2019 s nearest relative or\nprimary carer , and of the adult\u2019 s guardian, welfare attorney , or continuing attorney (if\nthey exist).\n\u2022Encourage residual capacity \u2014the adult should be encour aged to exercise whatever\ncapacity is still present.\nAssessment of capacity\nUnder the Act, incapacity means to be incapable of:\n\u2022Acting; or\n\u2022Making decisions; or\n\u2022Communicating decisions; or\n\u2022Understanding decisions; or\n\u2022Retaining the memory of decisions.\nCapacity is task-specific and must be judged in relati on to the decision under\nconsideration. In assessing capacity under the Act, the practitioner should consider for\nthis particular decision whether the individual:\n\u2022Understands what is being asked and why .\n\u2022Understands that the information is personally relevant to them.\n\u2022Is aware of the alternative choices available.\n\u2022Can weigh up the risks and benefits associated with the alternative choices.\n\u2022Has suf ficient memory ability to retain the relevant information.\nAdditionally , the practitioner should consider whether the decision is consistent with\nthe patient\u2019 s background, beliefs, and previously expressed wishes when greater\ncapacity existed. It is important to note that a person is not incapable simply because\nthey have a mental or physical illness or a learning disability .\nT echniques covered by the Act\nPowers of attorney  A capable adult can provide for eventual incapacity by granting\npower of attorney to another person. A continuing power of attorney relates to financial\ndecisions; a welfare power of attorney relates to personal welfare decisions. The latter\nbecomes active only when the adult loses capacity in relation to the welfare decision in\nquestion."

The\nformer is financial guardians hip, and the latter welfare guardianship. For decisions\nwhich require a \u2018one-of f\u2019 intervention, the Sherif f can grant a financial or welfare\nintervention order covering the proposed intervention.\nMedical treatment  Under Part 5 of the Act, if a medical practitioner respon sible for\nthe medical treatment of an adult is of the opinion that the adult is incapable in relation\nto a decision about the medical treatment in question, he may issue a certificate of\nincapacity authorizing the treatment. The certificate must state the nature and likely\nduration of the incapacity and the proposed treatment.\nBodies with powers under the Act\nThe Office of the Public Guardian  Supervises individuals authorized under the Act to\nmake decisions on behalf of another .

This court is also the forum for appea ls against medical treatment\ndecisions.\nLocal authorities  The local authority has a duty to investigate circumstances where\nthe personal welfare of an adult in the community may be at risk due to incapacity , to\nsupervise appointed attorneys and guardians, and to investigate complaints in relation\nto those exercising welfare powers. Additionally , they have a duty to apply for\nintervention or guardianship orders and to subsequently act as welfare guardian where\nnecessary and no-one else is applying to do so.\nIncapacity Act: Northern Ireland\nThe Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 received Royal assent in May 2016\nbut, at the time of writing, has not yet come into force.

Former \u2018wards of court\u2019 are to be discharged from wardship and\ninstead directed towards the most appropriate support option under the new Act.\nAssisted decision-making  Here the person appoints a \u2018decision-making assistant\u2019 via\na formal \u2018assistance agreement\u2019 to aid them in gathering and understanding information\nand to assist them in expressing their decision.

They are not legally binding on medical practitioners, but the\npractitioner must be prepared to justify non-compliance with their stipulations.\nCriminal offences  The Act introduces a number of criminal offences in relation to\nincapable adults, including using fraud or coercion in relation to supported or proxy\ndecision-making, making a false statement in relation to an intervention under the Act,\nand ill treatment or wilful neglect of an incapable adult.\nBodies with powers under the Act"

The conditions must be for\nthe purpose of ensuring that the patient receives medical treatment or of preventing\nrisk of harm to the patient or to other people, and should be kept to a minimum number\nconsistent with achieving their purpose.

No one pursued the\ncase further .\nAfter the murder , Tatiana\u2019 s parents became aware of this prior knowledge and\nsued the university regents, hospital, and police department, claiming that, at least, a\nwarning should  have been issued to her. On 1 July 1976 (>6.5yrs after the murder),\nthe Supreme Court of California found that the defendants had breached their duty to\nexercise reasonable care. In other words, physicians and therapists have a duty to\nwarn third parties of threatened danger arising from a patient\u2019 s violent intentions. As\na final stateme nt, the Court stated that \u2018protective privilege ends where public peril\nbegins\u2019.\nNote:  although often quoted when discussing issues of confidentiality , this case has no legal bearing in the UK.\nEven in the USA, the impact of the T arasof f case has been less dramatic and intrusive than one might expect.\nDisclosure in connection with judicial or other statutory proceedings\nUnder certain circumstances, disclosure of information is required by law:\n\u2022Notification of a known or suspected communicable disease.\n\u2022If ordered to do so by a judge or presiding officer of a court (unless the information\nappears to be irrelevant, e.g. details of relatives or partner s of the patient not party to\nthe proceedings)."

So psychiatry became both a medical and\na socia l science, hoping to address post-W orld War II problems:\nmass migration, rapid socio-economic change, and tension between\nneighbouring nations.\nIn the early twentieth century , there were two dominant theories of\n\u2018culture\u2019\u2014defined as \u2018the temperament, ideas, and beliefs of\npeoples\u2019. Darwin\u2019 s theories had been extended to \u2018cultural\nDarwinism\u2019, which deemed culture to be universal, with the\ndevelopment stage varying globally and the dominant western\nculture being the \u2018most advanced\u2019. The anthropologist Frank Boas\ndisagreed and took a more relativist view. He believed culture varied\ndue to the range of experiences and environments to which cultural\ngroups were exposed. A logical extension of the Boasian theory\npostulated that if personality and behaviours were affected by\nculture, could culture cause mental illness? Using the Freudian\ntheory , culture may lead to intrapsychic conflict, altering thought and\nbehaviour through primitive  defence mechanisms, with resulting\npsychological disturbance or mental illness. Since the focus of\nanthropology and psychiatry seemed increasingly aligned, it was felt\nthat an alliance could be mutually beneficial. After the personal and\nsocietal trauma of war, a mood of collaboration to heal societies\u2019\nwounds prevailed, prompting Wittkower to move to Canada to join\nCameron\u2014transcultural psychiatry was born.\nFrom the start, tensions existed. Some believed mental illness was\nuniversal, with culture only impacting on presentation. To others, this\nwas a thoughtless over-s implification. Maybe psychiatry and\nanthropology were not so similar? Psychiatry viewed culture as a\npotential cause of mental illness that could be diagnosed and treated\nin a relatively  short time frame of months to years, whereas\nanthropology viewed culture as nurturing of individuals over much\nlonger time frames. The advent of effective medication s to treat\nmental illness and the subse quent decline in Freud\u2019 s theory caused\na seismic shift in psychiatric thinking. Neo-Kraeplinism and the\nmedical model became the popular paradigm. New diagnostic\nclassification systems (ICD-9 in 1975 and DSM-III in 1980) became"

DSM-5 considers the term \u2018culture-\nbound syndrome \u2019 to be insufficient to encomp ass the broad range of\nboth presenta tions and variation in severity . Similarly , \u2018idioms of\ndistress \u2019, \u2018popular category of distress \u2019, \u2018cultural syndrome \u2019, and\n\u2018explanatory model \u2019 are also regarded as inadequate. The agreed\nterm \u2018cultural concep t of distress \u2019 (CCD) attempts to bring together\nthese concepts without implying cultural exclusivity .\nGMH research has now started to apply epidem iological\nmethodology more systematically to the available evidence. For\nexample, a multinational group of resea rchers, led by Duke Global\nHealth Institute has compared CCDs with diagnostic criteria and\nepidemiological/aetiological determinants of psychiatric disorders\nthrough a literature review and meta-analysis that included 45\nstudies of sufficient quality , comprising 18,782 unique participants.8\nThe most common CCDs were identified (\n Examples of the most\ncommon cultural concepts of distress , p. 990), and there were\nassociations between CCD and mental disorder , with an increase in\nodds of 7.5 of having depress ion, five times the odds of having GAD,\nand ten times the odds of having PTSD. While the authors\nacknowledged that CCDs are not inherently unam enable to\nepidemiological study , the poor quality of the evidence base has\nimpeded conc eptual advanc ement and service application. It is\nhoped that through the use of culturally contextual rating scales [e.g.\nthe Systematic  Assessment of Quality in Observational  Research\n(SAQOR) adapted for use in cultural psychiatric epidemiology\n(SAQOR-CPE)], CCD research could lead to enhanced detection of\nmental health problems by identifying vulnerable populations (i.e.\nCCD may be regarded as prodromal or as a vulnerability marker),\nreduced cultural biases in diagnostic criteria, and \n  cultural salience\nof interventions\u2014both service delivery and ef fective treatment."

For each drug, the British National Formulary  (BNF) specifies the\ndoses, indications, cautions, and adverse effects, which reflect those in the manufacturer \u2019s\nSummary of Product Characteristics. However , in spite of various licensed treatments, patients will\noften remain symptomatic and psychiatrists will consider prescribing medications outside the\nnarrow terms of their licence.4 Unlicen sed prescribing does  not imply lack of evidence in support of\nthe proposed intervention and can still be safe and benefic ial to the patient. In fact, it has also been\nargued that the product licence for a drug does not necessarily represent the best use of that\ncompound.\nGeneral points\n\u2022The real extent of unlicensed prescribing in the UK is largely unknown; however , a systematic\nreview of antipsychotic prescribing in children, adults, and the elderly found that off-label\nprescribing can be found in up to 75% of prescriptions.\n\u2022Drug companies do not usually test their medicines on children; hence, they cannot apply to\nlicense their medicines for use in the treatment of children. Nonetheless, BAP5 has stated that\nhealthcare professionals have  a responsibility to prescribe the most effective and safe treatments\nfor the benefit  of their patients, and practitioners should use their professional judgement to\ndetermine these uses.\n\u2022No psychotropic medication is currently licensed for use in pregnancy or in breastfeeding\nmothers.\n\u2022It has been argued that the final prescribing decision should rest with the clinician, based on the\navailability of other therapeutic options and careful assess ment of the potential risks and benefits\n(see Box 22.1  for legal considerations).\nT ypes of unlicensed prescribing\n\u2022The prescription of a medication for an indication that is not covered within the terms of the\nMarket Authorization.\n\u2022The prescription of a medication to a patient who lies outside the age range specified within the\nSummary of Product Characteristics.\n\u2022The prescription of a medication at doses above the maximum recommended dosage (\n Box\n5.7 Guidelines for use of high-dose antipsychotics, p. 216).\n\u2022The use of a licensed medication for longer periods than those specified within the Marketing\nAuthorization.\nRecommendations for unlicensed prescribing\n\u2022Unlicensed prescribing should only occur when licensed treatments have been used or\nconsidered but excluded on clinical grounds (e.g. contraindications, risk of interactions).\n\u2022The prescriber should be familiar with any possible benefits and risks of the proposed treatment\n(ask specialist pharmacist for further guidance).\n\u2022Particular consideration is needed with children, older patients, and patients lacking capacity (\nConsent to treatment , p. 936).\n\u2022Whenever possible, a full explanation of the treatment should be given to the patient (and/or their\nrelative, when relevant) and documented in the notes.\n\u2022Whenever possible, agreem ent of the patient (and/or their relative, when relevant) should be\nobtained, but if not possible, this should be noted.\n\u2022Prescription should be started cautiously , and the patient\u2019 s progress monitored closely , with full\ndocumentation of treatment ef fectiveness and tolerance."

Proposed mechanisms are: \n  viscera l adiposity through histaminergic H1\nantagonism, leptin resistance, \n  tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- \u03b1 levels; inhibition of insulin secretion\nin pancreatic \u03b2-cells through antagonism of muscarinic M3 receptors; \n  glucose sensitivity through\nantagonism of serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors; \n  insulin release through antagonism of adrenergic\n\u03b12 receptors; inhibition of GLUT glucose transporter .\nManagement\n\u2022Prior to initiating antipsychotic treatment \u2014determine baseline measures such as fasting glucose\nand HbA1c.\n\u2022When a patient gains 5% or more of their initial weight \u2014at any time during therapy , consideration\nshould be given to switching to an antipsychotic with less weight gain liability (\n  Weight gain with\npsychiatric medication , p. 1000 ). However , it should be noted that weight gain can occur with all\nantipsychotics and considerable variability exists among patients receiving the same drug\nregarding the risk of metabolic ef fects.\n\u2022For patients at risk of diabe tes\u2014changing to an antipsychotic less likely to cause metabolic\neffects should be balanced against the risks and benefits from continuing treatment with the\nsame drug. Adjunctive treatments include oral hypoglyca emics (e.g. metformin) or insulin, and\nany metabolic abnormalities should be treated according to accepted national guidelines.\n\u2022Lifestyle modifications \u2014can be used successfully for weight control in highly motivated subjects\nand may be complementary to medication (i.e. calorie-controlled diet/regular physical exercise).\nBox 22.2 Metabolic syndrome [syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, Reaven\u2019 s\nsyndrome, or CHAOS (Australia)]\nEssence"

If drug\ntreatment is required, the individual disorders that comprise the metabolic syndrome are treated\nseparately: diuretics and ACE inhibitors for hypertension; and cholesterol-lowering drugs to lower\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and TG levels and to raise HDL levels. Use of drugs\nthat decrease insulin resistan ce, e.g. metformin and thiazolidinediones, is controversial and local\nguidelines will apply .\nNote:  the term \u2018metabolic syndrome\u2019 dates back to at least the late 1950s but came into common usage in the late 1970s to\ndescribe various associations of risk factors with diabetes that had been noted as early as the 1920s. Confusion arose because\nthe term was used by different authors  to describe different, albeit related, syndromes, e.g. Haller (1997), Singer (1977), Phillips\n(1977, 1978). It was the eponymous Gerald M Reaven who coined the term \u2018syndrome X\u2019 in his 1988 Banting lecture. He\nproposed insulin resistance as the underlying factor and did not include abdominal obesity as part of the condition.
