            "Text": "Preface\nWhat is the bigger challenge\u2014for a student or the instructor to\nunderstand what is important in medical microbiology? Many years ago\nwhen I took my first graduate course in medical microbiology, I read\nthousands of pages of text, listened to 5 hours of lectures a week, and\nperformed lab exercises 6 hours a week for 1 year. I was given a\nwonderful foundation in microbiology, but I frequently asked the\nquestion\u2014that was voiced by all the students\u2014do I really need to know\nall this stuff? The answer to that question is certainly no, but the\nchallenge is what information is needed. Years later when I set out to\nwrite my first textbook on microbiology, my goal was to only give the\nstudents what they need to know, described in a way that is informative,\nfactual, and concise. I think I was successful in that effort, but I also\nrealize that the discipline of microbiology continues to change as do\napproaches to presenting information to the students. I am still firmly\nconvinced that my efforts in my first textbook, \nMedical Microbiology,\nand subsequent editions are important, forming the foundation of\nmicrobiology knowledge for a student. This cannot be replaced by a\nquick search of the internet or a published review because much of the\nsubject matter presented in Medical Microbiology\u2014epidemiology,\nvirulence, clinical diseases, diagnostics, treatment\u2014is a distillation of the\nreview of numerous research articles and clinical and technical\nexperience. Having stated that, students frequently turn to review books\nconsisting of abbreviated summaries, illustrations (should I say\ncartoons), and various mnemonic aids for mastering this subject. As I\nhave watched this evolution of learning microbiology, I am struck by the\nsacrifice that has been made. I believe microbiology is a beautiful subject,\nwith the balance between health and disease defined by the biology of\nindividual organisms and microbial communities. Without an\nunderstanding of the biology, lists of facts are soon forgotten. But I am a\nrealist and know the burden students face, mastering not only\nmicrobiology but also a number of other subjects. So the personal\n12"

            "Text": "question I posed was\u2014is there a better way to present to the student a\nsummary of information that is easy to understand and remember? This\nbook is my approach to solving this question. First, almost by definition,\nit is not comprehensive. Just as I have carefully selected organisms and\ndiseases to present in this book, I have also intentionally not mentioned\nothers\u2014not because they are unimportant but because they are less\ncommon. I have also not presented a detailed discussion of microbial\nbiology and virulence or the immune response of the patient to an\ninfection, but simply presented the association between an organism and\ndisease. Again, I felt those discussions should be reserved for \nMedical\nMicrobiology\n. Finally, the organization of this book is focused on\norganisms\u2014bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites\u2014rather than diseases.\nI do this because I think it is easier for a student to remember a limited\nnumber of diseases associated with an organism rather than a long list of\norganisms (or a significantly incomplete list) implicated in a specific\ndisease such as pneumonia. Still, patients present with disease and the\nobserver must develop a list of organisms that could be responsible; so to\naid the student, I provide this differential diagnosis in the introductory\nchapter of each organism section (\nChapters 2\n, \n12\n, \n18\n, and \n22\n). I also\nprovide in these introductory chapters an overview of the classification\nof the organisms (a structural framework for remembering the\norganisms) and a listing of antimicrobials that are used to treat infections.\nThe individual chapters in Sections 1\u20134 are organized in a common\ntheme: brief discussion of the individual organisms, a summary of facts\n(properties, epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment)\nprovided in a concise table, illustrations provided as a visual learning\naid, and clinical cases to reenforce the clinical significance of the\norganisms. Finally, examination questions are provided to help the\nstudent assess their ability to assimilate this material. Again, I will\nemphasize that this text should not be considered a comprehensive\nreview of microbiology. On the other hand, I believe if the student\nmasters this material, he or she will have a firm foundation in the\nprinciples and applications of microbiology. I certainly welcome all\ncomments on how successful my efforts are.\nI would like to acknowledge the support and guidance from the\nElsevier professionals who help bring this concept to reality, particularly\nJim Merritt, Katie DeFrancesco, Nicole DiCicco, and Tara Delaney.\nAdditionally, I want to thank the many students who have challenged\n13"

However, microbiology is not so challenging if the subject matter\n\u2014the microbes\u2014are subdivided into groups and further subdivided into\nrelated units.

Now the perceptive\nstudent would say that this gives us 8 families of viruses and not 20.\nWell, the viruses are further subdivided by their shape (spherical or\nrodlike) and size (big or small [\u201cpico\u201d]). Thus the key to understanding\nviruses is to place them into their respective families based on their\nstructural features.\nBacteria\nBacteria are a bit more complex, with both RNA and DNA, metabolic\nmachinery for self-replication, and a complex cell wall structure. Bacteria\nare \nprokaryotic\n organisms; that is, simple unicellular organisms with no\nnuclear membrane, mitochondria, Golgi bodies, or endoplasmic\nreticulum and they reproduce by asexual division. The key feature that is\nused to separate most bacteria is their staining property, with the Gram\nstain and acid-fast stain the most important. Most bacteria are either\ngram-positive\n (retain the blue dye) or \ngram-negative\n (lose the blue stain\nand stain with the red dye). These bacteria are then subdivided by their\nshape (either spherical [cocci] or rod-shaped), whether they grow\naerobically or anaerobically (many bacteria grow in both atmospheres\nand are called \nfacultative anaerobes\n), and whether they form resilient\nspores\n or not (only gram-positive rods are spore-formers). The other\nimportant bacterial stain is the \nacid-fast\n stain that is retained only by a\nfew bacteria that have a characteristic lipid-rich cell wall. This group is\nfurther subdivided by how difficult it is to remove the acid-fast stain (the\nstain is named because an acid solution removes the stain from most\nother bacteria). Finally, there are groups of organisms that do not stain\nwith these procedures so they are separated by other features, such as\nshape (spiral-shaped bacteria) or their need to grow inside a host cell\n(e.g., leukocyte) or cell cultures in the laboratory.\nFungi and Parasites\nFungi and parasites are more complex \neukaryotic\n organisms that contain\na well-defined nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and endoplasmic\nreticulum. Single-celled and multi-celled organisms are members of both\ngroups.

Molds are complex organisms\nwith the cells organized into threadlike tubular structures \n(hyphae)\n and\nspecialized asexual reproductive forms \n(conidia)\n. The molds are then\nfurther subdivided by the structure of the hyphae (pigmented or\nnonpigmented, separated into individual cells [septated molds] or not)\nand the arrangement of the conidia.\nParasites\nParasites are also subdivided into single-celled organisms \n(protozoa)\n or\nmulti-celled organisms (\nworms\n and \nbugs\n). Members of the family\nProtozoa are then further divided into amebae, flagellates (think of them\nas hairy protozoa), and coccidia (some are spherical-shaped but many are\nnot). The worms (technically called \nhelminthes\n) are nicely classified by\ntheir shape: roundworms, flatworms, and tapeworms.

The \nbugs\n are\nsimply \u201cbugs.\u201d These include mosquitos, ticks, fleas, lice, mites, and flies.\nThey are important because they are vectors of a number of viruses and\nbacteria (not fungi) that are responsible for diseases.

We have coined the derogatory term \ngerms,\n and great\nefforts are made to eliminate our exposure to these organisms. The reality\nis most microbes are not only good but critical for our health.

These\norganisms are critical for the maturation of our immune system,\nimportant metabolic functions such as the digestion of food products,\nand protection from infection with unwanted pathogens. These\norganisms are referred to as our \nnormal flora\n or \nmicrobiome\n. If these\norganisms are maintained in their proper balance, then health can be\nmaintained. If they are disrupted either naturally or through man-made\ninterventions (e.g., antibiotics, skin peels, enemas) then we risk disease.\nInfectious diseases are also initiated when the members of the\nmicrobiome are introduced into normally sterile sites (e.g., abdominal\ncavity, tissues, lungs, urinary tract) through trauma or disease. This is\nreferred to as an \nendogenous\n infection or an infection caused by the\nnormal microbial population. Finally, infections can be caused by\nexogenous\n organisms; that is, those introduced from outside. Only a few\nof the microbes that we encounter from our environment are pathogens,\nbut some of the most serious infections are caused by these exogenous\npathogens. So the important lesson is that most microbes are good and\nnot associated with disease. A subset of our endogenous organisms can\ncause disease when introduced into normally sterile areas, but most\nendogenous organisms do not have the virulent properties to cause\ndisease. Likewise, most of the exogenous organisms we are exposed to\ncause no problems at all, but some can cause quite significant disease. It\nis important to understand which organisms have the necessary\nproperties (\nvirulence\n) to cause disease and under what circumstances\nthis will occur. It is also important to understand which organisms to\nignore because they are not associated with disease.\nConclusion\nThe perceived complexity of microbiology is simplified if we understand\nthe relationships between members of each of the four groups of\nmicrobes. This is further simplified if we separate the pathogens from\nnonpathogens and then understand the conditions under which the\npathogens produce disease. The following chapters are designed to\ndevelop these themes for the individual groups of organisms.\n20"

I\ncertainly do not expect the student to master these details before he or\nshe moves on to the rest of the bacteriology chapters. Rather, a quick scan\nof the information should be done first. Then, as each subsequent chapter\nis digested, this chapter can provide a framework for linking each of the\nbacteriology chapters.\nOverview\nBacteria are prokaryotic (\npro\n, before; \nkaryon\n, kernel) organisms that are\nrelatively simple in structure. They are unicellular and have no nuclear\nmembrane, mitochondria, Golgi bodies, or endoplasmic reticulum, and\nthey reproduce by asexual division. The bacterial cell wall is complex,\nconsisting of one of two basic forms defined by their staining ability with\nthe \nGram stain\n: a gram-positive cell wall with a thick peptidoglycan\nlayer, and a gram-negative cell wall with a thin peptidoglycan layer and\nan overlying \nouter membrane\n. Some bacteria lack this cell wall structure\nand compensate by surviving only inside host cells in a hypertonic\nenvironment. The human body is inhabited by thousands of different\nbacterial species (called the \u201c\nmicrobiome\n\u201d), some living transiently,\nothers in a permanent synergistic relationship. Likewise, the\nenvironment that surrounds us, including the air we breathe, water we\ndrink, and food we eat is populated with bacteria, many of which are\nrelatively harmless and some of which are capable of causing life-\nthreatening disease. Disease can result from the toxic effects of bacterial\nproducts (e.g., toxins) or when bacteria invade normally sterile body\ntissues and fluids.\n22"

The structure of the thick, cross-\nlinked cell wall allows these bacteria to survive on dry surfaces, such as\nhospital linens, tables, and door knobs.

The species with the\ngreatest potential for disease are \nS. aureus\n, \nS. pyogenes\n, and \nS.\npneumoniae\n, illustrated by the wide variety of virulence factors\nexpressed by each. Particularly noteworthy are a group of toxins:\nstaphylococcal enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins, and toxic shock syndrome\ntoxin, as well as \nS. pyogenes\n pyrogenic exotoxins.

Simply\nrecovering these bacteria in a clinical specimen does not define disease.\nDisease is found in specific populations of patients and under well-\ndefined conditions, so it is important to understand this epidemiology.\nDiagnosis of \nS. aureus\n infections is generally not difficult because the\norganism grows readily in culture and nucleic acid amplification tests \nare\nwidely used for the rapid detection of both methicillin-susceptible \nS.\naureus\n (MSSA) and MRSA in clinical specimens.

Other gram-positive bacteria\nassociated with gastrointestinal disease include \nB. cereus\n (much larger\nthan this organism) and \nClostridium difficile\n, both of which are much\nlarger than this isolate and neither cause bacteremia. The patient\nreported a recent history of eating cantaloupe, which was provocative\nbecause cantaloupes were implicated in a multistate outbreak of\nListeria\n gastroenteritis at the time of this patient\u2019s disease; however, the\npatient\u2019s strain was a different serotype from that implicated in the\noutbreak. This case illustrates the syndrome of fever and nonbloody\ndiarrhea that is typical of \nListeria\n infections, and the increased risk of\nbacteremia (as well as meningitis) for specific risk groups:\nimmunocompromised patients such as in this case, as well as very\nyoung children, pregnant women, and the elderly. A careful food\nhistory (such as consumption of raw vegetables, unpasteurized mild\nsoft cheeses, and delicatessen foods) is important because the\nindividual case may be part of a broader outbreak of disease.\n53"

Similar outbreaks have\nbeen reported in the literature, which illustrates the risks associated\nwith contamination of waters with rapidly growing mycobacteria; the\ndifficulties of confirming these infections by routine bacterial cultures,\nwhich are typically incubated for only 1 to 2 days; and the need for\neffective antibiotic therapy.\nIt is difficult to list virulence properties for acid-fast bacteria, because\nmuch of the pathology results from the infected host\u2019s response to the\norganism. \nM. tuberculosis\n is an intracellular pathogen that is able to\nestablish a lifelong infection. Maintenance of persistent infections,\nwithout progression to disease, involves a delicate host\u2013parasite\nrelationship: balance between growth of the bacteria and immunologic\ncontrol by the host. When the host regulation is disrupted, progressive\ndisease develops. At the time of exposure, \nM. tuberculosis\n enters the\nrespiratory airways and penetrates the alveoli, where the bacteria are\nphagocytized by alveolar macrophages. The bacteria prevent fusion of\nthe phagosome with lysosomes and evade macrophage killing. However,\nin response to infection with \nM. tuberculosis\n, macrophages secrete the\ncytokines IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 that in turn recruit T-cells and natural killer\ncells into the area of the infected macrophages, activate the macrophages,\nand stimulate intracellular killing. The subsequent mass of necrotic cells\n(termed \ngranuloma\n) will contain the infection, but also permits some\nsurviving bacteria. These are the bacteria that will subsequently cause\ndisease when the immune process is disrupted.\nThe ability of \nM. leprae\n to produce disease is also a manifestation of\nthe slow growth properties of the organism and the host immunologic\nresponse. This organism is acquired through inhalation of infectious\naerosols or through skin contact with respiratory secretions or wound\nexudates. The bacteria replicate very slowly and disease may take years\nbefore it is clinically apparent.

Members of this\nfamily are \nubiquitous\n, found worldwide in soil, water, and vegetation,\nand are part of the normal intestinal flora of most animals, including\nhumans. All members can grow rapidly, aerobically and anaerobically,\non a variety of nonselective (e.g., blood agar) and selective (e.g.,\nMacConkey agar) media. The Enterobacteriaceae have simple nutritional\nrequirements, they ferment glucose, and are oxidase negative. The\nabsence of cytochrome oxidase activity is an important characteristic\nbecause it can be measured rapidly with a simple test and is used to\ndistinguish the Enterobacteriaceae from many other fermentative (e.g.,\nVibrio\n) and nonfermentative (e.g., \nPseudomonas\n) gram-negative rods.\nThe appearance of the bacteria on culture media has been used to\ndifferentiate common members of the Enterobacteriaceae. For example,\nfermentation of lactose\n (detected by color changes in lactose-containing\nmedia such as the commonly used MacConkey agar) has been used to\ndifferentiate some enteric pathogens that do not ferment lactose (e.g.,\nSalmonella\n, \nShigella\n; colorless colonies on MacConkey agar) from\nlactose-fermenting species (e.g., \nEscherichia\n, \nKlebsiella\n; pink-purple\ncolonies on MacConkey agar). \nResistance to bile salts\n in some selective\nmedia has also been used to separate enteric pathogens (e.g., \nShigella\n,\nSalmonella\n) from commensal organisms that are inhibited by bile salts. In\nthis example, use of culture media that assess lactose fermentation and\nresistance to bile salts is a rapid screening test \nfor enteric pathogens that\nwould be otherwise difficult to detect in diarrheal stool specimens where\nmany different organisms may be present.

Epidemiologic investigations determined that\n62 individuals (29% attack rate) developed gastroenteritis following\nconsumption of as few as one raw oyster. In addition to watery\ndiarrhea, the ill individuals reported abdominal cramping (82%), chills\n(44%), myalgias (36%), headache (32%), and vomiting (29%), with\nsymptoms lasting a median of 5 days. None of the persons required\nhospitalization. All of the oysters were harvested from a single farm,\nwhere the water temperatures in July and August were recorded at\n16.6\u00b0C and 17.4\u00b0C. Water temperatures above 15\u00b0C are considered\nfavorable for growth of \nV. parahaemolyticus.\n Since 1997, the mean\nwater temperatures at the oyster farm have increased by 0.21\u00b0C per\nyear, and now remain consistently above 15\u00b0C. Thus this seasonal\nwarming has extended the range of \nV. parahaemolyticus\n and the\nassociated gastrointestinal disease. This outbreak illustrates the role of\ncontaminated shellfish in \nV. parahaemolyticus\n disease and the clinical\nsymptoms typically observed.\n \nClinical Case\nSepticemia Caused by \nVibrio vulnificus\nSepticemia and wound infections are well-known complications\nfollowing exposure to \nV. vulnificus\n.

            "Text": "12\nIntroduction to Viruses\nOverview\nViruses are the simplest and generally smallest microbe. They are\nobligate intracellular parasites, dependent on their host cell for survival\nand replication. In many ways these are the most efficient microbes,\ncarrying the minimum amount of genetic information as DNA or RNA\n(but not both), possessing a simple protein shell (called capsid) and in\nsome cases surrounded by a membranous envelope. Their life cycle\nconsists of finding the right host cell (defined by specific receptors for the\ndifferent viruses), penetrating into the cell, and then either remaining\ndormant in the cell by integrating into the host DNA or taking over the\nhost metabolic machinery to direct viral replication. After a period when\nmany viral particles have been produced, the particles can either be\nslowly released from the host cell (to preserve the cell integrity and\nsurvival) or essentially explode from the cell in search of new cellular\ntargets.\nThe replication and pathology of most viral infections is restricted to\nspecific host cell types (e.g., cells of the hematopoietic system, respiratory\ntract, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, liver, etc.); therefore\nvirology is best understood by focusing on the viruses that infect specific\ntarget cells or organs. This is in contrast with bacteria where a single\nspecies can infect many tissues (consider infections caused by\nStaphylococcus aureus\n), or a bacterial infection at a specific site can be\ncaused by many bacteria (consider all the bacteria that can cause\npneumonia). Therefore for the presentations in the virology chapters the\nfocus will be on the viruses associated with specific disease states. This\nsection is not a comprehensive review of all viruses of medical\nimportance. Rather, the focus is on the viruses that will be encountered\nmost commonly in medical practice.\n141"

The highest incidences of\ndisease are in the poorest countries of the world in sub-Saharan Africa\nand in south, southeast, and eastern Asian countries. AIDS-related\nmorbidity and mortality in these regions is further complicated by the\nhigh coprevalence of malnutrition and infectious disease such as\nhepatitis B and C, malaria, and tuberculosis. The reality is that a great\ndeal of human suffering will occur before our dreams of conquering this\ndisease are realized.\nTo provide a focus for this chapter, it is important to know the\nmembers of the Retroviridae family of viruses and an understanding of\nwhat will be discussed:\nRetroviridae Family of Viruses\nAdditional delta retroviruses have been described but not conclusively\nassociated with human disease. HIV-2 causes a disease similar to HIV-1\nbut is geographically restricted to west Africa, progresses more slowly,\nand is less transmissible. The focus of this chapter will be restricted to\nHIV-1.\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1)\nHIV-1 is subdivided into four groups (M, N, O, and P) based on the\norigin of the parent virus. Group M is responsible for the global spread of\nHIV-1 while the other groups have remained restricted to western Africa.\nGroup M is subdivided further into nine subtypes with:\n\u2022 Subtype B predominant in western Europe, the Americas, and\nAustralia\n\u2022 Subtype C predominant in Africa and India\nThe methods for transmission of HIV-1 are well known: genital contact\nwith infectious body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, and blood;\n151"

Risk factors for transmission include unprotected sex,\nsexual exposure to multiple partners, sexual exposure to genital ulcers\n(e.g., due to syphilis or herpes simplex virus), men who have sex with\nmen, intravenous drug abuse, and transfusion with unscreened blood\nproducts. The likelihood of transmission is directly related to the viral\nconcentration in the infectious fluids or tissues, so risk is highest when\ncontact is with an individual with active, advanced disease.\nFollowing exposure to HIV, the virus binds and penetrates into CD4 T\nlymphocytes and other cells with the appropriate receptors. This is\nfollowed by rapid viral replication that induces inflammatory cytokines\nand chemokines. Viral replication is balanced by HIV-specific CD8 T-cell\nkilling of the infected cells, thus depleting the CD4 T-cell population with\nresulting compromised T-cell immune response. Innate immunity\nmediated by natural killer cells is also important for containing the\ninfection. Although viral exposure can progress to unrelenting immune\nsuppression and associated complications, most infections are\ncharacterized by an extended period of latency where slow viral\nreplication can occur; most infected cells remain dormant, only to\nreactivate months or years later.\nThe central role of the CD4 T cells is the initiation and regulation of the\ninnate and immune responses. Activated cells initiate immune responses\nby the release of cytokines required for the activation of epithelial cells,\nneutrophils, macrophages, other T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.\nInitially this is manifested by increased susceptibility to infections with\nfungi (e.g., \nCandida\n, \nCryptococcus\n, \nHistoplasma\n, \nPneumocystis\n, and\nMicrosporidia\n) and bacteria. Further depletion of immune\nresponsiveness is associated with opportunistic infections with\nintracellular bacteria (e.g., mycobacteria and nocardia), parasites (e.g.,\nToxoplasma\n, \nCryptosporidium\n, and \nCystoisospora\n), and viruses (e.g.,\nherpesvirus group and JC polyomavirus), as well as some viral related\nneoplasms (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus lymphoma and human herpesvirus 8\nKaposi sarcoma). These opportunistic infections and malignancies are the\nhallmark of AIDS and the primary contributor to AIDS-related mortality.\nLaboratory diagnosis of HIV infections is complex with many different\napproaches in use. Rapid point-of-care immunoassays are widely used as\nscreening tests for assessment of patients with active infections.\n152"

The\ndisadvantage of these tests is relatively poor sensitivity, particularly\nwhen used shortly following exposure to HIV. Laboratory-based\nimmunoassays are also available, with significantly better analytic\nperformance. The most recently designed tests detect both\nimmunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies to recombinant\nHIV antigens as well as expression of the HIV p24 antigen. Although\nthese tests are an improvement over the point-of-care tests, they are\nunreliable for detection of early infections. For this purpose, detection of\nviral RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests is used to screen blood\nproducts or to assess the quantity of viral particles in the blood of an\ninfected patient (for staging disease or monitoring response to therapy).\nTherapy has made remarkable progress since the first antivirals were\ndeveloped, providing more manageable drug regiments, less toxicity,\nand better therapeutic outcomes. More than 25 drugs or combinations of\ndrugs currently exist. Although treatment options are rapidly changing,\ncurrent practice is the use of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, protease\ninhibitor, or integrase inhibitor. Prophylactic treatment of pregnant\nwomen and individuals exposed to contaminated blood (e.g.,\nneedlestick) is recommended.

It is remarkable that within the\nsame virus family, most strains are responsible for mild upper\nrespiratory infections while others such as SARS and MERS can cause\ndevastating pneumonia with multiorgan involvement.\nInfluenza Viruses\nThese are the oldest recognized respiratory viruses producing epidemic\ndisease every few years. The structural properties of these viruses are\nimportant to understand. The genetic information is encoded in single-\nstranded RNA. Single-stranded nucleic acids (as with the other\nrespiratory viruses discussed in this chapter) are more susceptible to\nmutations during replication, so gene products such as the surface\nproteins (in the case of influenza these would be hemagglutinin [H] and\nneuraminidase [N]) can be altered. This can create a previously\nunrecognized virus (new virus: little or no immunity). The influenza\nviruses have the RNA arranged in discrete segments, so if a cell is\ninfected with two different influenza viruses, rearrangement can occur\ncreating a unique third virus. This is the reason novel viruses can be\ncreated every few years and produce epidemics. A worldwide pandemic\ncan occur if the virus is both unique and highly infectious and, if the\nstrain is highly virulent, a pandemic associated with high mortality can\noccur. There are three distinct influenza groups: A, B, and C. Influenza A\nand B viruses are responsible for epidemic disease, with influenza A\ncausing more severe disease; and influenza C virus causes milder upper\nrespiratory infections. The circulating strain of influenza virus is\nidentified by its type and surface proteins, such as A (H3N2). Influenza A\nstrains circulate in bird populations (\u201cavian flu\u201d) so the opportunity for a\nnew strain to emerge is great. In some cases these strains will also\ncirculate in pig populations (\u201cswine flu\u201d) further increasing their genetic\nuniqueness and virulence. The following is a summary of these viruses.\nInfluenza Viruses\n167"

These are\neukaryotic organisms that contain a well-defined nucleus, mitochondria,\nGolgi bodies, and endoplasmic reticulum. They are distinguished from\nother eukaryotic organisms by a rigid cell wall composed of \nchitin\n and\nglucan\n and a cell membrane in which \nergosterol\n is substituted for\ncholesterol as the major sterol component. These unique structural\nproperties are exploited both for diagnosis and as targets for antifungal\ntreatment.\nAs with the word of caution in the Introduction of the Bacteriology\nSection, the student should not be intimidated by the lists of fungi,\ndiseases, and antifungal agents found in this chapter. Rather, I felt it was\nimportant to provide a structure to organize the information presented in\nthis Section, and I encourage the students to return to this chapter as they\nmaster the information in the other chapters on fungi.\nClassification\nFungi are classified in their own separate kingdom, Kingdom Fungi, and\nexist either as unicellular organisms (\nyeasts\n) that can replicate asexually,\nor as multicellular filamentous organisms (\nmolds\n) that replicate sexually\nand asexually. Although most fungi exist in only one of the two forms,\nsome clinically important fungi can assume either morphology\n(\ndimorphic fungi\n). A few other morphologic features are important for\nthe student to understand. Fundamentally, molds consist of filaments\ncalled \nhyphae\n with budding forms or \nspores\n. Molds have been\nhistorically identified by the morphology of these structures. The hyphae\ncan be subdivided into a string of individual compartments or cells\nseparated by a \nseptum\n or wall, and are either pigmented (\ndematiaceous\n184"

Thus the molds can be\nsubdivided into three groups: nonseptate (generally nonpigmented)\nmolds; septate, dematiaceous molds; and septate, hyaline molds.\nAlthough this may be a bit confusing, it has a practical application in\nclassifying some of the fungal diseases, as will be seen in the subsequent\nchapters.\nThe taxonomy of fungi is complex and, frankly, beyond the interest of\nmost students and physicians. Suffice to say that the asexual form of\nmolds (\nanamorph\n) and the sexual form of molds (\nteleomorph\n) have\ndifferent morphologies and have historically had different names. For the\npurpose of this textbook, only the commonly recognized names\n(primarily the anamorph names) will be used.\nIn contrast with the chapters on bacteria and later chapters on\nparasites, this section of the textbook has been organized based on the\nclinical presentation of disease: cutaneous and subcutaneous fungi,\nsystemic dimorphic fungi, and opportunistic fungi. The following table is\na list of the most common diseases and associated genera of fungi in each\ngroup.

In 1930 the current name was selected because the mold\nresembles \nCoccidioides\n and the majority of cases had been described in\nBrazil. Although the fungus resembles \nCoccidioides\n, disease is more like\nthat caused by \nBlastomyces\n, hence the common name \nSouth American\nBlastomycosis\n. Disease is endemic throughout Latin America in areas\nwith high humidity, rich vegetation, and moderate temperatures.\nParacoccidioidomycosis\n may be subclinical, progressive with acute or\nchronic pulmonary disease, or disseminated disease involving the skin,\nlymph nodes, liver, spleen, CNS, and bones.\nT. marneffei\n is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-\ninfected and other immunosuppressed patients in Southeast Asia. The\nfungus was originally isolated in rats from Vietnam in 1952. It was\nbelieved to be a \nPenicillium\n species and was named in honor of Hubert\nMarneffe, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Indochina. It was renamed\nT. marneffei\n in 2015; however, the disease is still referred to as\npenicilliosis\n. Disease presents with fever, cough, and pulmonary\ninfiltrates, and can progress to disseminated disease characterized by\norganomegaly, skin lesions, and hematologic disorders.\nBlastomyces dermatitidis\nB. dermatitidis\n is responsible for the disease \nblastomycosis\n. It is a\ndimorphic fungus that grows as a filamentous mold in moist, rich\norganic soil and as yeast cells in patients. Animals, particularly dogs, are\nalso susceptible to disease with this organism.\n201"

A necrotic area developed on the superior aspect of\nthe right nostril, extending to the upper lip. A presumptive diagnosis of\nleishmaniasis was entertained, based in part on the patient\u2019s country of\norigin and possible exposure to a sandfly bite.\nLaboratory studies revealed anemia and lymphopenia.

All parasites are classified\nas eukaryotic, some are unicellular and others are multicellular, some are\nas small as 4 to 5 \u00b5m in diameter and others are up to 10 meters in length,\nand some are amorphous with minimal features whereas others have\ncharacteristic structures, such as a head, body, and legs. Historically,\nparasitic infections were viewed as exotic diseases acquired only in\nremote regions of the world, but the reality is that some of the more\ncommon parasitic infections can be acquired in most communities in\ndeveloped countries, and global transportation can bring diseases\nrestricted to remote regions of the world to anyone\u2019s doorsteps. The\nepidemiology of these diseases is equally challenging, with some\nparasites spread from person to person while others require a complex\nseries of hosts for development into infectious forms. The difficulties\nconfronting students are not only an understanding of the spectrum of\ndiseases caused by parasites but also an appreciation of the epidemiology\nof these infections, which is vital for developing a differential diagnosis\nand an approach to the control and prevention of parasitic infections.\nWith literally hundreds of parasites associated with human disease, the\nstudent needs some help in organizing the most relevant information. In\nthis chapter and subsequent ones, I will concentrate on only the most\ncommon parasites associated with human disease, recognizing that\navirulent parasites, particularly those classified in the kingdom Protozoa,\ncan colonize humans and create confusion when detected in clinical\nspecimens. In this chapter, I first provide a classification structure for the\nparasites and then a view of the parasites from the perspective of the\ndiseases they cause. I also provide an overview of the antiparasitic agents\nthat can be used to treat these infections. In the subsequent chapters, I\nprovide a more detailed view of the biology, epidemiology, clinical\ndisease, diagnosis, and treatment of these organisms.\n222"

Because both\nparasites and humans are eukaryotic, many antiparasitic agents also act\non human metabolic pathways; that is, these agents can pose a risk of\ntoxicity. Differential toxicity is achieved by preferential uptake, metabolic\nalteration of the drug by the parasite, or differences in susceptibility\nbetween host and parasite. Agents used for the treatment of \nprotozoan\ninfections\n generally target nucleic acid synthesis, protein synthesis, or\nspecific metabolic \npathways that are unique for the rapidly proliferating\nparasites. In contrast, agents used for treatment of the \nhelminth\ninfections\n target unique metabolic pathways in the nonproliferating\nadult worms. Because the student may not be familiar with the\nantiparasitic agents, I will first present a listing of the different classes of\nagents and then summarize the specific agents used to treat each\nparasite.

Hepatitis A can initially present as a mild flulike\nillness with fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise.
