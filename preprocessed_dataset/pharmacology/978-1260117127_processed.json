            "Text": "Preface \nThis book is designed to help students review plw:macology \nand to prepare for both. regular course examinations and board \nexaminations. The thirteenth. edition has been rev.ised to make \nsuch ptepaiation as active and efficient as possible. Ar. with. ear\u00ad\nlier editions, rigorous standards of accuracy and currency have \nbeen maintained in keeping with. the book's status as the com\u00ad\npanion to the BMic & Clinical Pharmaco/.or; textbook.. This \nreview book divides pharmacology into the topics used in most \ncourse& and textbooks. Major introductory chapters (eg, auto\u00ad\nnomic pharmacology and CNS pharmacology) are included \nfor integration with. rd.evant physiology and biochemistry. The \nchapter-based approach facilitates use of this book in conjW\\c\u00ad\ntion with course notes or a larger text. We recommend several \nstrategies to make reviewing more effective (Appendix I con\u00ad\ntains a swnmary oflearning and test-taking strategies that most \nstudents find useful). \nFirst. each chapter has a short discussion of the major con\u00ad\ncepts that underlie iu basic principle$ or the specific drug group, \naccompanied by explanatory figures and tables. Students are \nadvised to read the ten thoroughly before they attempt to answer \nthe ttudy questions at the end of each chapter. If a concept is \nfound to be difficult or confu&ing, the student is advised to con\u00ad\nsult a regular textbook such as Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, \n15th edition. \nSecond. each drug-oriented chapter opens with an Overview \nthat organizes the group of drugs visually in diagrammatic form. \nWe recommend that students practice reproducing the overview \ndiagram from memory. \nThird. a list of High-Yield Tums to Learn and their deAni\u00ad\ntions is near the front of most chapters. Make swe that you are \nable to define those terms. \nFourth, many chapters include a Skill Kaper question that \nprompts the student to review previous material and to see links \nbetween related topics. We suggest that students tty to answer \nSkill Keeper que&tions on their own before checking the answers \nthat are provided at the end of the chapter. \nFifth, each of the sixty-two chapters contains up to ten \naample questions followed by a set of answers with explana\u00ad\ntions. For mo&t effective learning. you should take each set of sample questions as if it were a real examination. After you have \nanswered every question, work through the answers. When you \nare analyzing the answers, make sure that you understand why \neach choice is either correct or incorrect. \nSixth, each chapter includes a Checklist of focused tasks that \nyou should be able to do once you have Anished the chapter. \nSeventh, most chapters end with a Summary Table that lists \nthe most important drugs and includes key information con\u00ad\ncerning their mechanisms of action. effects, clinical uses, pbar\u00ad\nmacokinetics, drug interactions, and tOldcities. \nEighth, when preparing for a comprehensive examination, \nyou should review the sttategies described in Appendis: I if \nyou have not already done so. Then review the list of drugs in \nAppendix II: Key Word.t for Key Drugs. Students are also \nadvised to check this appendix as they work through the chap\u00ad\nters so they can begin to identify drugs out of the context of a \nchapter that reviews a restricted set of drugs. \nNinth, after you have worked your way through most or all \nof the chapters and have a good grasp of the Key Drugs, you \nshould take the comprehensive examinations, each of 100 ques\u00ad\ntions, presented in Appendices DI and IV. These examinations \nare followed by a list of answers, each with a short explanation \nor rationale underlying the correct choice and the numbers of \nthe chapters in which more information can be found if needed. \nWe recommend that you take an. entire examination or a block \nof questions aa if it were a real examination: commit to answers \nfor the whole set before you check the answers. Ar. you work \nthrough the answers, make sure that you understand why each \nanswer is either correct or incorrect. If you need to, return to the \nrelevant chapters(s) to review the ten that covers key concepts \nand facts that form the baais for the question. \nWe recommend that this book be used with a regular text. \nBasic & Clinical Pharmacolo1:1. 15th edition (McGraw-Hill, \n2020), follow& the chapter sequence used here. However, this \nreview book is designed to complement any standard medical \npharmacology text. The student who completes and Wlder\u00ad\nstands Phamutco/ogy: &mination t!r BoarJ &view will greatly \nimprove their performance and will have an excellent command \nof pharmacology. \nvii"

            "Text": "2 PART I Basic Principles \n\u2022 I. THE NATURE OF DRUGS \nDrugs in common use include inorganic ions, nonpeptide organic \nmolecules, small peptides and proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and \ncarbohydrates. Some are fuund in plants or animals, and others are \npartially or completely synthetic. Many drugs fuund in nature are \nalkaloids, molecules that create a basic (alkaline) pH in solution, usu\u00ad\nally as a result of amine groups in their structure. Many biologically \nimportant endogenous molecules and erogenous drugs are optically \nactive; that is, they contain one or more asymmetric centers and can \nexist as enantiomers. The enantiomers of optically active drugs usually \ndiffer, sometimes more than 1000-fuld, in their affinity fur biologic \nreceptor sites. Furthermore, such enantiomers may be metabolized at \ndifferent rates in the body, with important clinical consequences. \nA. Size and Molecular Weight \nDrugs vary in size from molecular weight (MW) 7 (lithium) to \nover MW 50,000 (thrombolytic enzymes, antibodies, other pro\u00ad\nteins). Most drugs, however, have MWs between 100 and 1000. \nDrugs smaller than MW 100 are rarely sufficiently selective in \ntheir actions, whereas drugs much larger than MW 1000 are often \npoorly absorbed and poorly distributed in the body. Most protein \ndrugs (\"biologicals~) are commercially produced in cell, bacteria, \nor yeast cultures using recombinant DNA technology. \nB. Drug-Receptor Bonds \nDrugs bind to receptors with a variety of chemical bonds. These \ninclude very strong covalent bonds (which usually result in irre\u00ad\nversible action), somewhat weaker reversible electrostatic bonds \nHigh-Yield Terms to Learn (eg, between a cation and an anion), and much weaker interactions \n(eg, hydrogen, van der Waals, and hydrophobic bonds). \nPHARMACODYNAMIC PRINCIPLES \nA. Receptors \nWith few exceptions, drug actions are mediated through the \neffects of drug ligand molecules on drug receptor\u2022 in the body. \nMost receptors are large regulatory molecules that influence \nimportant biochemical processes (eg, enzymes involved in glucose \nmetabolism) or physiologic processes (eg, ion channel receptors, \nneurotransmitter reuptake transporters, and ion transporters). \nIf drug-receptor binding results in activation of the receptor mol\u00ad\necule, the drug is termed an agonilq if inhibition results, the drug is \nconsidered an antagonist. Some drugs mimic agqnift molecules by \ninhibiting metabolic enzymes that degrade endogenous agents, fur \nexample, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. As suggested in Figure 1-1, a \nreceptor molecule may have several binding sites. Quantitation of the \neffects of drug-receptor interaction as a function of dose (or concen\u00ad\ntration) yields dose--respon.se wrves that provide information about \nthe nature of the drug-receptor interaction. Dose-response phenom\u00ad\nena are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. A few drugs are enzymes \nthemselves (eg, thrombolytic enzymes, pancreatic enzymes). These \ndrugs do not act on endogenous receptors but on substrate molecules. \nB. Receptor and Inert Binding Sites \nBecause most ligand molecules are much smaller than their recep\u00ad\ntor molecules (discussed in the text that follows), specific regions \nDrugs \nDrug receptors \nDistribution phase \nEllmlnatlon phase \nEndocytosls, exocytosls Substances that act on biologic systems at the chemical (molecular) level and alter their functions \nThe molecular components of the body with which drugs interact to bring about their effects \nThe phase of drug movement from the site of administration into the tissues \nPermeation \nPharmacodynamlcs \nPharmacokinetics \nTransporter \nMutagenic \nCarcinogenic \nTeratogenic The phase of drug inactivation or removal from the body by metabolism or excretion \nEndocytosis: Absorption of material across a cell membrane by enclosing it in cell membrane \nmaterial and pulling it into the cell, where it can be processed or released. Exocytosis : Expulsion of \nmaterial from vesicles in the cell into the extracellular space \nMovement of a molecule (eg, drug) through the biologic medium \nThe actions of a drug on the body, including receptor interactions, dose-response phenomena, and \nmechanisms of therapeutic and toxic actions \nThe actions ofthe body on the drug, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. \nElimination of a drug may be achieved by metabolism or by excretion.

            "Text": "4 PART I Basic Principles \nof receptor molecules provide the local areas responsible for drug \nbinding. Such areas are termed receptor sites or recognition sites. \nIn contrast, some drugs bind to some nonregulatory molecules in \nthe body without producing a discernible effect. Such binding \nsites are termed inert binding sites. In some compartments of the \nbody (eg, the plasma), inert binding sites play an important role \nin buffering the concentration of a drug because bound drug does \nnot contribute directly to the concentration gradient that drives \ndiffusion. Albu.min and orosomucoid (a1-acid glycoprotein) are \ntwo important plasma proteins with significant drug-binding \ncapacity that nevertheless lack direct regulatory actions. \nPHARMACOKINETIC PRINCIPLES \nTo produce useful therapeutic effects, most drugs must be \nabsorbed, distributed, and eliminated. Pharmacokinetic principles \nmake rational dosing possible by quantifying these processes. \nThe Movement of Drugs in the Body \nTo reach its receptors and bring about a biologic effect, a drug \nmolecule (eg, a benzodiazepine sedative) must travel from the \nsite of administration (eg, the gastrointestinal tract) to the site of \naction (eg, the brain). \nA. Permeation \nPermeation is the movement of drug molecules into and within \nthe biologic environment. It involves several processes, the most \nimportant of which include the following: \n1. Aqueous diffusion-Aqueous diffusion is the passive move\u00ad\nment of molecules through the watery extracellular and intracellular \nspaces. The membranes of most capillaries have small water-filled \npores that permit the aqueous diffusion of molecules up to the size of \nsmall proteins between the blood and the extravascular space. This \nis a passive process governed by Fick's law (see later discussion). The \ncapillaries in the brain, testes, and some other organs lack aqueous \npores, and these tissues are less exposed to some drugs. \n2. Upld diffusion-Lipid diffusion is the passive movement of \nmolecules through lipid bilayer cell membranes and other lipid bar\u00ad\nriers. Like aqueous diffusion, this process is governed by Fick's law. \n3. Transport by special carrien-Drugs that do not readily \ndiffuse through membranes may be transported across barriers by \nmechanisms that carry similar endogenous substances. A very large \nnumber of such transporter molecules have been identified, and \nmany of these are important in the movement of drugs or as targets \nof drug action. Unlike aqueous and lipid diffusion, carrier transport \nis not governed by Fick's law and has a maximum capacity, that is, \nis saturable. Important examples are transporters for ions (eg, Na+/ \nK'\" ATPase), for neurotransmitters (eg, transporters for serotonin, \nnorepinephrine), for metabolites {eg, glucose, amino acids), and \nfor foreign molecules (xenobiotics) such as anticancer drugs. \nAfter release, amine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepineph\u00ad\nrine, and serotonin) and some other transmitters are recycled into nerve endings by selective transport molecules. Selective inhibitors \nfor these transporters often have clinical value; for example, sev\u00ad\neral antidepressants act by inhibiting the transport of amine neu\u00ad\nrotransmitters back into the nerve endings from which they have \nbeen released or into nearby cells. \n4. Endoqtosis-Endocytosis occurs through binding of the mol\u00ad\necule to specialized components (receptors) on cell membranes, \nwith subsequent internalization by infolding of that area of the \nmembrane. The contents of the resulting intracellular vesicle are \nsubsequently released into the cytoplasm of the cell. Endocytosis \npermits very large or very lipid-insoluble chemicals to enter cells. For \nexample, large molecules such as proteins may cross cell membranes \nby endocytosis. Smaller, polar substances such as vitamin B12 and \niron combine with special proteins {B12 with intrinsic factor and \niron with transferrin), and the complexes enter cells by this mecha\u00ad\nnism. Because the substance to be transported must combine with \na membrane receptor, endocytotic transport can be quite sdective. \n&ocytosis is the reverse process, that is, the expulsion of material \nthat is membrane-encapsulated inside the cell out of the cell. Most \nneurotransmitters are released by exocytosis. \nB. Fick\"s Law of Diffusion \nFick's law predicts the rate of movement of molecules across a \nbarrier. The concentration gradient (C1 -C2) and permeability \ncoefficient for the drug and the area and thickness of the barrier \nmembrane are used to compute the rate as follows: \nRa (c C , Permeability coefficient A te= 1-21X Th\" kn x rea (1) 1c ess \nThus, drug absorption into the blood is faster within organs \nwith large surface areas, such as the small intestine, than from \norgans with smaller absorbing areas (the stomach). Furthermore, \ndrug absorption is faster from organs with thin membrane barriers \n(eg, the lung) than from those with thick barriers {eg, the skin). \nC. Water and Lipid Solubility of Drugs \n1. Solubility- The aqueous solubility of a drug is often a func\u00ad\ntion of the electrostatic charge (degree of ionization, polarity) of \nthe molecule, because water molecules behave as dipoles and are \nattracted to charged drug molecules, forming an aqueous shell \naround them. Conversely, the lipid solubility of a molecule is \ninversely proportional to its charge. \nMany drugs are weak bases or weak acids. For such molecules, \nthe pH of the medium determines the fraction of molecules charged \n(ionized) versus uncharged (nonioniz.cd). If the pK,. of the drug \nand the pH of the medium are known, the fraction of molecules \nin the ionized state can be predicted by means of the Hendcnon\u00b7 \nHasselbalch equation: \n1 ( Protonated form ) K H \nog Unprotonated form = p a -p (2) \n\"Protonated\" means associated with a proton (a hydrogen ion); \nthis form of the equation applies to both acids and bases. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

For example, most drugs \nare freely filtered at the glomerulus, but lipid-soluble drugs can \nbe rapidly reabsorbed from the tubular urine. If a patient takes an \noverdose of a weak acid drug, for example, aspirin, the excretion \nof this drug is faster in alkaline urine. This is because a drug that is \na weak acid dissociates to its charged, polar form in alkaline solu\u00ad\ntion, and this form cannot readily diffuse from the renal tubule \nback into the blood; that is, the drug is trapped in the tubule. \nConversdy, excretion of a weak base (eg. pyrimethamine, amphet\u00ad\namine) is faster in acidic urine (Figure 1-2}. \nAbsorption of Drugs \nA. Routes of Administration \nDrugs usually enter the body at sites remote from the target tis\u00ad\nsue or organ and thus require transpon by the circulation to the \nintended site of action. To enter the bloodstream, a drug must \nbe absorbed from its site of administration (unless the drug has \nbeen injected directly into the vascular compartment). The rate \nand efficiency of absorption differ depending on a drug's route of \nadministration as well as the drug's physicochemical propenies. \nIn fact, for some drugs, the amount absorbed may be only a small \nfraction of the dose administered when given by cenain routes. \nThe amount absorbed into the systemic circulation divided by the \namount of drug administered constitutes its bioavailability by \nthat route. Common routes of administration and some of their \nfeatures are listed in Table 1-1. \nB. Blood Flow \nBlood flow influences absorption from intramuscular and subcu\u00ad\ntaneous sites and, in shock, from the gastrointestinal tract as well. \nHigh blood flow maintains a high concentration gradient between \nthe drug depot and the blood and thus facilitates absorption. \nC. Concentration \nThe concentration of drug at the site of administration is impor\u00ad\ntant in determining the concentration gradient relative to the \nblood as noted previously.

Because the nonionized, uncharged form \ndiffuses readily across the lipid barriers of the nephron, this form may \nreach equal concentrations in the blood and urine; in contrast, the \nionized form does not diffuse as readily. Protonation occurs within \nthe blood and the urine according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch \nequation. Pyrimethamine, a weak base of pl<,, 7.0, is used in this \nexample. At blood pH, only 0.4 \u00b5mol of the protonated species will be \npresent for each 1.0 \u00b5mol of the u nprotonated form. The total con\u00ad\ncentration in the blood will thus be 1.4 \u00b5mol/L if the concentration of \nthe unprotonated form is 1 .0 \u00b5moVL. In the urine at pH 6.0, 10 \u00b5mol \nof the nondiffusi ble ionized form wil I be present for each 1.0 \u00b5mol \nof the unprotonated, diffusible form. Therefore, the total urine con\u00ad\ncentration (11 \u00b5mol/L) may be almost 8 times higher than the blood \nconcentration. \nthe concentration gradient is a major determinant of the rate \nof absorption. Drug concentration in the vehicle is particularly \nimportant in the absorption of drugs applied topically. \nDistribution of Drugs \nA. Determinants of Distribution \n1. Size of the organ-The size of the organ determines the con\u00ad\ncentration gradient between blood and the organ. For example, \nskeletal muscle can take up a large amount of drug because the \nconcentration in the muscle tissue remains low (and the blood\u00ad\ntissue gradient high) even after rdatively large amounts of drug \nhave been transferred; this occurs because skeletal muscle is a very \nlarge organ. In contrast, because the brain is smaller, distribution \nof a smaller amount of drug into it will raise the tissue concentra\u00ad\ntion and reduce the blood-tissue concentration gradient to zero, \npreventing funher uptake of drug unless it is activdy transported. \n2. Blood flow-Blood flow to the tissue is an important deter\u00ad\nminant of the rate of uptake of drug, although blood flow may not \naffect the amount of drug in the tissue at equilibrium. As a result, \nwell-perfused tissues (eg, brain, hean, kidneys, and splanchnic"

Solubility- The solubility of a drug in tissue influences the \nconcentration of the drug in the extracellular fluid surrounding \nthe blood vessels. If the drug is very soluble in the adjacent cells, \nthe concentration in the perivascular extracellular space will be \nlower and diffusion from the vessel into the extravascular tissue \nspace will be facilitated. For example, some organs (such as the \nbrain) have a high lipid content and thus dissolve a high concen\u00ad\ntration oflipid-soluble agents rapidly. \n4. Binding-Binding of a drug to macromolecules in the blood \nor a tissue compartment tends to increase the drug's concentration \nin that compartment. For example, warfarin is strongly bound to \nplasma albumin, which restricts warfarin' s diffusion out of the vas\u00ad\ncular compartment. Conversely, chloroquine is strongly bound to TABLE 1-2 Average values for some physical \nvolumes within the adult human body. \nCompartment Volume (Ukg body weight) \nPlasma 0.04 \nBlood 0.08 \nExtracellular water 0.2 \nTotal body water 0.6 \nFat 0.2-0.35 \nextravascular tissue proteins, which results in a marked reduction \nin the plasma concentration of chloroquine. \nB. Apparent Volume of Distribution and Physical Volumes \nThe apparent volume of distribution 01 J is an important phar\u00ad\nmacokinetic parameter that reflects the above determinants of the \ndistribution of a drug in the body. Yd relates the amount of drug \nin the body to the concentration in the plasma (see Chapter 3). In \ncontrast, the physical volumes of various body compartments are \nless important in pharmacokinetics (Table 1-2). However, obesity \nalters the ratios of total body water to body weight and fat to total \nbody weight, and this may be important when using highly lipid\u00ad\nsoluble drugs. A simple approximate rule for the aqueous compart\u00ad\nments of the normal body is as follows: 40% of total body weight \nis intracellular water and 20% is extracellular water; thus, water \nconstitutes approximately 60% of body weight. \nMetabolism of Drugs \nDrug disposition is a term sometimes used to refer to metabo~ \nlism and elimination of drugs. Some authorities use disposition to \ndenote distribution as well as metabolism and elimination. Metab\u00ad\nolism of a drug sometimes terminates its action, but other effects \nof drug metabolism are also important. Some drugs when given \norally are metabolized before they enter the systemic circulation. \nThis flrst~pass metabolism was referred to in Table 1-1 as one \ncause oflow bioavailability. Drug metabolism occurs primarily in \nthe liver and is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4. \nA. Drug Metabolism as a Mechanism of Adivation or \nTermination of Drug Action \nThe action of many drugs {eg, sympathomimetics, phenothi\u00ad\nazines) is terminated before they are excreted because they are \nmetabolized to biologically inactive derivatives. Conversion to an \ninactive metabolite is a form of elimination. \nIn contrast, prodrugs (eg, levodopa, minoxidil) are inactive \nas administered and must be metabolized in the body to become \nactive. Many drugs are active as administered and have active \nmetabolites as well (eg, morphine, some benzodiazepines). \nB. Drug Ellmlnatlon Without Metabolism \nSome drugs ( eg, lithium, many others) are not modified by the body; \nthey continue to act in unchanged form until they are excreted. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

For drugs with first-order kinetics (left), rate of elimination (units per \nhour) is proportional to concentration; this is the more common process. In the case of zero-order elimination (right), the rate is constant and \nindependent of concentration. \nElimination of Drugs \nAlong with the dosage, the rate of elimination following the last \ndose (disappearance of the active molecules from the site of action, \nthe bloodstream, and the body) determines the duration of action \nfor many drugs. Therefore, knowledge of the time course of con\u00ad\ncentration in plasma is one factor used in predicting the intensity \nand duration of effect for most drugs. Not~: Drug elimination is \nnot the same as drug excretion: A drug may be eliminated by metab\u00ad\nolism long before the modified molecules are excreted from the \nbody. For most drugs and their metabolites, excretion is primarily \nby way of the kidney. Volatile anesthetic gases, a major exception, \nare excreted primarily by the lungs. For drugs with active metabo\u00ad\nlites (eg, diazepam), elimination of the parent molecule by metab\u00ad\nolism is not synonymous with termination of action. For drugs \nthat are not metabolized, excretion is the mode of elimination. A \nsmall number of drugs combine irreversibly with their receptors, \nso that disappearance from the bloodstream is not equivalent to \ncessation of drug action: These drugs may have a very prolonged \naction. For example, phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible inhibi\u00ad\ntor of a adrenoceptors, is eliminated from the bloodstream in less \nthan 1 h after administration. The drug's action, however, lasts for \n48 h, the time required for the synthesis of new receptors. \nA. First-Order Elimination \nThe term first-order elimination indicates that the rate of elimina\u00ad\ntion is proportional to the concentration (ie, the higher the concen\u00ad\ntration, the greater the amount of drug eliminated per unit time). \nThe result is that the drug's concentration in plasma decreases \nexponentially with time (Figure 1-3, left). Drugs with first-order \nelimination have a characteristic half-life of elimination that is \nconstant regardless of the amount of drug in the body. The concen\u00ad\ntration of such a drug in the blood will decrease by 50% for every \nhalf-life. Most drugs in clinical use demonstrate first-order kinetics. \nB. Zero-Order Ellmlnatlon \nThe term zero-order elimination indicates that the rate of elimina\u00ad\ntion is constant regardless of concentration (Figure 1-3, right). This occurs with drugs that saturate their elimination mechanisms \nat concentrations of clinical interest. As a result, the concentra\u00ad\ntions of these drugs in plasma decrease in a linear fashion over \ntime. Such drugs do not have a constant half-life. This is typical \nof ethanol (over most of its plasma concentration range) and of \nphenytoin and aspirin at high therapeutic or toxic concentrations. \nPharmacokinetic Models \nA. Multicompartment Distribution \nAfter absorption into the circulation, many drugs undergo an \nearly distribution phue followed by a slower elimination phase. \nMathematically, this behavior can be simulated by means of a \n\"two-compartment model\" as shown in Figure 1--4. The two com\u00ad\npartments consist of the blood and the extravascular tissues. (Note \nthat each phase is associated with a characteristic half-life: t112a for \nthe first phase, t112~ for the second phase. Note also that when con\u00ad\ncentration is plotted on a logarithmic axis, the elimination phase \nfor a first-order drug is a straight line.) \nB. Other Distribution Models \nA few drugs behave as if they were distributed to only one compart\u00ad\nment (eg, if they are restricted to the vascular compartment). Oth\u00ad\ners have more complex distributions that require more than two \ncompartments for construction of accurate mathematical models. \n\u2022 II. DRUG DEVELOPMENT Br \nREGULATION \nThe sale and use of drugs are regulated in most countries by govern\u00ad\nmental agencies. In the United States, regulation is by the Food and \nDrug.Admin.istntion (FDA). New drugs are developed in industrial \nor academic laboratories and occasionally in government (eg. National \nInstitutes of Health) laboratories. Before a new drug can be approved \nfor regular therapeutic use in humans, a series of animal (prcdinic:al) \nand experimental human studies (clinical trials) must be carried out."

Rational \nmolecular design or screening is then used to find a molecule that \nsdectivdy alters the function of the target. New drugs may result \nfrom the screening of hundreds of compounds against modd dis\u00ad\neases in animals. In contrast, many so-called \"me-too\" drugs are \nthe result of simple chemical alteration of the pharmacokinetic \nproperties of an original prototype agent. \nSAFETY & EFFICACY \nBecause society expects prescription drugs to be safe and effec\u00ad\ntive, governments regulate the development and marketing of \nnew drugs. Current regulations in the USA require evidence of \nrdative safety (beginning with acute and subacute toxicity testing \nin animals) and probable therapeutic action (from the pharmaco\u00ad\nlogic profile in animals) before human testing is permitted. Some \ninformation about the pharmacokinetics of a compound is also \nrequired before clinical evaluation is begun. Chronic toxicity test \nresults are generally not required, but such testing must be under\u00ad\nway before human studies are started. The devdopment of a new \ndrug and its pathway through various levels of testing and regula\u00ad\ntion are illustrated in Figure 1-5. The cost of devdopment of a \nsingle new drug, including false starts and discarded molecules, may be greater than $500 million although the true cost is often \nhidden by the manufucturer. \nANIMAL TESTING \nThe animal testing of a specific drug that is required before human \nstudies can begin is a function of its proposed use and the urgency \nof the application. Thus, a drug proposed for occasional topical \nuse requires less extensive testing than one destined for chronic \nsystemic administration . \nBecause of the urgent need, anticancer drugs and some antiviral \ndrugs require less evidence of safety than do drugs used in treat\u00ad\nment of less threatening diseases. Urgently needed drugs are often \ninvestigated and approved on an accelerated schedule. \nA. Acute Toxicity \nAcute toxicity studies are required for all new drugs. These stud\u00ad\nies involve administration of incrementing doses of the agent up \nto the lethal levd in at least two species (eg, one rodent and one \nnonrodent}. \nB. Subacute and Chronic Toxicity \nSubacute and chronic toxicity testing is required for most agents, \nespecially those intended for cluonic use.

For drugs submitted after \nJune 2015, the letter scale has been abolished in favor of a narra\u00ad\ntive description of the safety or hazards of each drug, and separate \ncategories are established for pregnancy, lactation, and for males \nand females of reproductive potential. The new system is desig\u00ad\nnated the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PU.R) and \nis set forth at https://www.fda.gov/media/100406/download. New \nlabeling for drugs approved after 2001 will be phased in. Tento\u00ad\ngenesis can be defined as the induction of developmental defects \nin the somatic tissues of the fetus (eg, by exposure of the fetus to \na chemical, infection, or radiation). Teratogenesis is studied by \ntreating pregnant female animals of at least two species at sdected \ntimes during early pregnancy when organogenesis is known to take \nplace and by later examining the fetuses or neonates for abnormali\u00ad\nties. Examples of drugs known to have teratogenic effects include TABLE 1-3 FDA ratings of drug safety in \npregnancy.' \nA \nB \nc \nD \nx Description \nControlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk \nto the fetus In the flrst trimester (and there rs no evi\u00ad\ndence of a risk in later trimesters) , and the possibility \nof fetal harm appears remote \nEither animal reproduction studies have not demon\u00ad\nstrated a fetal risk but there are no control led studies \nIn pregnant women, or animal reproduction studies \nhave shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease \nin fertility) that was not confirmed in control led stud\u00ad\nies in women in the first trimester (and there is no \nevidence of a risk In later trimesters) \nEither studies In animals have revealed adverse effects \non the fetus (teratogen ic or embryocidal or other) and \nthere are no controlled studies In women, or studies \nin women and animals are not available. Drugs should \nbe given only when the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the fetus \nThere is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the \nbenefits from use in pregnant women may be accept\u00ad\nable despite the rfsk (eg, If the drug Is needed In a llfe\u00ad\nthreaten ing situation or for a serious disease for which \nsafer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective) \nStudies in animals or human beings have demon\u00ad\nstrated fetal abnormalit ies or there Is evidence of fetal \nrisk based on human experience or both, and the risk \nof the use of the drug ln pregnant women clearly out\u00ad\nweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindi\u00ad\ncated in women who are or may become pregnant \n\"Because of lack of definitive evidence for many drugs, many experts consider the \nA through X ranking system to be too slmpltstlc and Inaccurate; they prefer more \ndetailed narrative descriptions of evidence aYBilable for eacn drug in question.

Rubella is a very potent infec\u00ad\ntious teratogen. Mutagenais denotes induction of changes in the \ngenetic material of animals of any age and therefore induction of \nheritable abnormalities. The Ames test, the standard in vitro test \nfor mutagenicity, uses a special strain of salmonella bacteria whose \ngrowth depends on specific nutrients in the culture medium. Loss \nof this dependence as a result of exposure to the test drug signals \na mutation. Many carcinogens (eg, aflatoxin, cancer chemothera\u00ad\npeutic drugs, and other agents that bind to DNA) have mutagenic \neffects and test positive in the Ames test. The dominant lethal test \nis an in vivo mutagenicity test carried out in mice. Male animals \nare exposed to the test substance before mating. Abnormalities in \nthe results of subsequent mating (eg, loss of embryos, deformed \nfetuses) signal a mutation in the male's germ cells. \nC. Carcinogenesis \nCarcinogenesis is the induction of malignant characteristics in \ncells. Carcinogenicity is difficult and expensive to study, and \nthe Ames test is often used to screen chemicals because there is \na moderately high degree of correlation between mutagenicity in \nthe Ames test and carcinogenicity in some animal tests, as previ\u00ad\nously noted. Agents with known carcinogenic effects include coal \ntar, aflatoxin, dimethylnitrosamine and other nitrosamines, ure\u00ad\nthane, vinyl chloride, and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in \ntobacco smoke (eg, benzo[a]pyrene) and other tobacco products. \nCLINICAL TRIALS \nHuman testing requires the prior approval by the FDA of an lnves\u00ad\ntigational New Drug (IND) Exemption application, which is \nsubmitted by the developer to the FDA (Figure 1-5). The IND \nincludes all the preclinical data collected up to the time of submis\u00ad\nsion and the detailed proposal for clinical trials. Human testing \nalso requires approval by institutional committees that monitor \nthe ethical (informed consent, patient safety) and scientific aspects \n(study design, statistical power) of the proposed tests. The major \nclinical testing process is usually divided into three phases that are \ncarried out to provide information for a New Drug Application \n(NDA}. The NOA includes all the results of preclinical and clini\u00ad\ncal testing and constitutes the request for FDA approval of general \nmarketing of the new agent for prescription use. A fourth phase of \nstudy (the surveillance phase} follows NDA approval. In particu\u00ad\nlarly lethal conditions, the FDA may permit carefully monitored \ntreatment of patients before phases 2 and 3 are completed. \nA.Phase 1 \nA phase 1 trial consists of careful evaluation of the dose-response \nrelationship and the pharmacokinetics of the new drug in a small \nnumber of normal human volunteers (eg, 20-100). An excep\u00ad\ntion is the phase 1 trials of cancer chemotherapeutic agents and \nother highly toxic drugs; these are carried out by administering \nthe agents to volunteer patients with the target disease. In phase 1 studies, the acute effects of the agent are studied over a broad range \nof dosages, starting with one that produces no detectable effect and \nprogressing to one that produces either a significant physiologic \nresponse or a very minor toxic effect. \nB. Phase2 \nA phase 2 trial involves evaluation of a drug in a moderate number \nof sick patients (eg, 100-200) with the target disease. A placebo or \npositive control drug is included in a single-blind or double-blind \ndesign. The study is carried out under very carefully controlled \nconditions, and patients are closely monitored, often in a hospital \nresearch ward. The goal is to determine whether the agent has \nthe desired efficacy (ie, produces adequate therapeutic response; \na \"proof of concept\") at doses that are tolerated by sick patients. \nDetailed data are collected regarding the pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of the drug in this patient population. \nC. Phase3 \nA phase 3 trial usually involves many patients (eg, 1000-6000 or \nmore, in many centers) and many clinicians who are using the \ndrug in the manner proposed for its ultimate general use (eg, \nin outpatients). Such studies usually include placebo and posi\u00ad\ntive controls in a double-blind crossover design. The goals are \nto explore further, under the conditions of the proposed clinical \nuse, the spectrum of beneficial actions of the new drug, to com\u00ad\npare it with placebo (negative control) and older therapy (positive \ncontrol), and to discover toxicities, if any, that occur so infre\u00ad\nquently as to be undetectable in phase 2 studies. Very large \namounts of data are collected and these studies are usually very \nexpensive. Unfortunately, relatively few phase 3 trials include the \ncurrent standard of care as a positive control. \nIf the drug successfully completes phase 3, an NDA is submit\u00ad\nted to the FDA. If the NOA is approved, the drug can be marketed \nand phase 4 begins. \nD.Phase4 \nPhase 4 represents the postmarketing surveillance phase of evalu~ \nation, in which it is hoped that toxicities that occur very infre\u00ad\nquently will be detected and reported early enough to prevent \nmajor therapeutic disasters. Manufacturers are required to inform \nthe FDA at regular intervals of all reported untoward drug reac\u00ad\ntions. Unlike the first three phases, phase 4 has not been rigidly \nregulated by the FDA in the past. Because so many drugs have \nbeen found to be unacceptably toxic only after they have been \nmarketed, there is considerable current interest in making phase 4 \nsurveillance more consistent, effective, and informative. \nE. Adaptive Clinical Trials \nBecause the traditional 3-phase clinical trials are often prolonged \nand expensive, a newer type of clinical trial is currently under \ndevelopment. Adaptive trials are aimed at combining two or more \nof the traditional phases and altering conditions, dosage, and tar\u00ad\ngets as the trial progresses, based on data being collected. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Questions that deal with acid-base (Henderson-Hassdbalch) \nmanipulations are common on examinations. Since absorp\u00ad\ntion involves permeation across lipid membranes, we can in \ntheory treat an overdose by decreasing absorption from the \ngut and reabsorption from the tubular urine by making the \ndrug less lipitl soluble. Ionization attracts water molecules and \ndecreases lipid solubility. Chlorpropamide is a weak acid, \nwhich means that it is less ionized when protonated, that is, \nat acid pH. Choice C suggests that the drug would be less \nionized at pH 7.4 than at pH 2.0, which is clearly wrong \nfor weak acids. Choice D says (in effect) that the more ion\u00ad\nized form is absorbed more rapidly, which is incorrect. (Note \nthat the extent of absorption of many drugs is greater from \nthe intestine, because of its greater surface area.) A and B are \nopposites because NH4Cl is an acidifying salt and NaHC03 \nan alkalinizing one. (From the point of view of test strategy, \nopposites in a list of answers always deserve careful attention.) \nBecause an alkaline environment favors ionization of a weak \nacid, we should give bicarbonate. The answer is B. Note that \nclinical management of overdose involves many other consid\u00ad\nerations in addition to trapping the drug in urine; manipula\u00ad\ntion of urine pH may be contraindicated fur other reasons. \n2. Endocytosis is an important mechanism for transport of very \nlarge molecules across membranes. Aqueous diffusion is not \ninvolved in transport across the lipid barrier of cell mem\u00ad\nbranes. Lipid diffusion and special carrier transport are com\u00ad\nmon for smaller molecules. Hepatic metabolism has nothing \nto do with the mechanisms of permeation; rather, it is one \nfu:tor in the first-pass effect, metabolism before absorption \ninto the S}'lltemic circulation . The answer is B. \n3. United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-type \nquestions often contain a lengthy clinical description in the stem. CHAPTER 1 Introduction 13 \nOne can often determine the relevance of the clinical data by \nscanning the last sentence in the stem and the list of answers, see \nAppendix I. In this question, the emphasis is clearly on pharma\u00ad\ncokinetic principles. Ampicillin is an acid, so it is more ionized \nat alkaline pH and less ionized at acidic pH. The Henderson\u00ad\nHasselbalch equation predicts that the ratio changes from 50/50 \nat the pH equal to the pl<a to 1/10 {protonated/unprotonated) \nat 1 pH unit more alkaline than the pl<a and 1/100 at 2 pH units \nmore alkaline. For acids, the protonated form is the nonionized, \nmore lipid-soluble form. The answer is A. \n4. \"First-order\" means that the elimination rate is proportional \nto the concentration perfusing the organ of elimination. The \nhalf-life is a constant. The rate of elimination is proportional \nto the rate of administration only at steady state. The order of \ndimination is independent of the number of compartments \ninto which a drug distributes. The answer is B. \n5. This is a straightforward question of pharmacokinetic distri\u00ad\nbution concepts. Choice B is incorrect because distribution \ndepends on blood flow as well as solubility in the tissue; thus \nmost drugs will initially distribute to high-blood flow tissues \nand only later to larger, low-flow tissues, even if they are more \nsoluble in them. Distribution to peripheral tissues is reduced \nby strong binding in the vascular compartment. Volume of \ndistribution is one determinant of half-life (see Chapter 3). \nFrom the list of determinants of drug distribution given on \npages 5-6, choice C is correct. \n6. The excretion of most drugs follows first-order kinetics. \nHowever, ethanol and, in higher doses, aspirin and phenytoin \nfollow zero-order kinetics; that is, their elimination rates are \nconstant regardless of blood concentration. Ethanol is distrib\u00ad\nuted to total body water and is eliminated, in part, by the \nlungs; aspirin has neither of these properties. The answer is E. \n7. Drugs proposed for short-term use may not require long-term \nchronic testing. For some drugs, no primates are used; for \nother agents, only 1 species is used. The data from the tests, \nnot the evidence itself, must be submitted to the FDA. Pre\u00ad\ndiction of human drug allergy from animal testing is useful \nbut not definitive (see answer 12). Testing may be abbreviated \nfor drugs for which there is urgent need; the answer is E. \n8. The description of the test indicates that a chromosomal \nchange (passed from father to fetus) is the toxicity detected. \nThis is a mutation. The answer is B. \n9. D~ with first-order kinetics have constant half-lives, and \nwhen the log of the concentration in a body compartment is \nplotted versus time, a straight line results. The half-life is defined \nas the time required for the concentration to decrease by 50%. \nAs shown in the graph, the concentration ofNovexum decreased \nfrom 16 units at 1 h to 8 units at 4 hand 4 units at 7 h; there\u00ad\nfore, the half-life is 7 h minus 4 h or 3 h. The answer is C. \n10. Except for known toxic drugs (eg, cytotoxic cancer che\u00ad\nmotherapy drugs), phase 1 is carried out in 25-50 normal \nvolunteers. Phase 2 is carried out in several hundred closdy \nmonitored patients with the disease. Results of chronic toxic\u00ad\nity studies in animals are required in the NDA and are usually \nunderway at the time of IND submission. However, they do \nnot have to be completed and reported in the IND. Phase 4 \nis the general surveillance phase that follows marketing of the \nnew drug. It is not targeted at specific effects. Positive con\u00ad\ntrols and placebos are not a rigid requirement of any phase of \nclinical trials, although placebos are often used in phase 2 and \nphase 3 studies. The answer is A."

Such drugs are usually \nlabeled with warnings about these toxicities and, in the case \nof teratogenicity, are labded as contraindicated in pregnancy. \nThe answer is A. \nMany peptide and protein drugs, eg, insulin, antibodies, are \nin use; if identical or sufficiently similar to the human mol\u00ad\necules, anaphylaxis is uncommon. Most drugs do fall between \n100 and 1000 in molecular weight.

Recep\u00ad\ntors must be acL:ctive in their ligand-binding characteristics (so as to \nrespond to appropriate chemial signals and not to meaningless ones). \nReceptors must also be modi6abl.e when they bind a drug molecule (so \nas to bring about a change in function). Many receptors have been identi\u00ad\nfied, purified, chemially characteri7.ed, and cloned. Most are proteins; a \nfuw are other macromolecules such as DNA Some authorities consider \nenzymes as a separate category; fur the purposes of this book, enzymes \nthat are affi:.cted by drugs are considered receptors. The rcaptor n (also \nknown as the recognition site) fur a drug is the specific binding region of \nthe receptor macromolecule and has a relatively high and selective affinity \nfur the drug molecule. The interaction of a drug with its receptor is the \nfundamental event that initiates the action of the drug, and many drugs \nare classified on the basis of their primary receptor affinity. \nEFFECTORS \nEffu:tors arc molecules that translate the drug-receptor interaction into \na change in cellular activity. The best examples of effectors are enzymes \nsuch as adenylyl cyclase. Some receptors arc also effectors because a \nsingle molecule may incorporate both the drug-binding site and the \n16 effector mechanism. For example, a tyrosine kinase effector enzyme is \npart of the insulin receptor molecule, and a sodium-potassium chan\u00ad\nnd is the effector part of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor molecule. \nGRADED DOSE-RESPONSE \nRELATIONSHIPS \nWhen the response of a particular receptor-effector system is mea\u00ad\nsured against increasing concentrations of a drug, the graph of the \nresponse versus the drug concentration or dose is called a gratkd \ndose-response curve (Figure 2-lA). Plotting the same data on a loga\u00ad\nrithmic concentration axis usually results in a sigmoid curve, which \nsimplifies the mathematical manipulation of the dose-response \ndata (Figure 2-lB).

When plotted as the percentage of \nthe population that shows this response at each dose versus the \nlog of the dose administered, a cumulative quantal dose-response \ncurve, usually sigmoid in shape, is obtained. The median d'fec\u00ad\ntive dose (EDso), median toxic close (TD5o), and (in animals) \nmedian lethal dose (LDso) are derived from experiments car\u00ad\nried out in this manner.

Unlike the graded \ndose-response determination, no attempt is made to determine the \nmaximal effect of the drug. Quantal dose-response data provide \ninformation about the variation in sensitivity to the drug in a given \npopulation, and if the variation is small, the curve is steep. \nEFFICACY \nEfficacy---0ften called maximal efficacy-is the greatest effect \n(E.,_) an agonise can produce if the dose is taken to the highest \ntolerated level. Efficacy is determined mainly by the nature of the \ndrug and the receptor and its associated effector system. It can be \nmeasured with a graded dose-response curve (Figure 2-1) but not \nwith a quantal dose-response curve. By deflnition, partial agon.ists \nhave lower maximal efficacy than full agonists (see later discussion). \nPOTENCY \nPotency denotes the amount of drug needed to produce a specified \neffect. In graded dose-response measurements, the effect usually \nchosen is 50% of the maximal effect and the concentration or dose \ncausing this effect is called the f.Cso or ED50 (Figure 2-lA and B). \nPotency is determined mainly by the affinity of the receptor for \nthe drug and the number of receptors available. In quantal dose\u00ad\nresponse measurements, ED50> ID5\u00b0' and LD50 are also potency \nvariables (median effective, median toxic, and median lethal doses, \nrespectivdy, in the population studied). Thus, a measure of potency \ncan be specified using either graded or quantal dose-response curves \n(cg, Figures 2-1and2-2, respectivdy), but the numbers obtained \nare not identical and they have different meanings. \nSPARE RECEPTORS \nSpare receptors are said to exist if the maximal drug response \n(E.,_) is obtained at less than 100% occupation of the receptors \n(BrnaJ. In practice, the determination is usually made by compar\u00ad\ning the concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC5o) with the \nconcentration for 50% of maximal binding (K.i). If the EC50 is less \nthan the K.i, spare receptors are said to exist (Figure 2-3). This \nmight result from one of two mechanisms. First, the duration of \nthe ejfoaor aaivation may be much greater than the duration of the \ndrug-receptor interaction. Second, the actual number of receptors \nmay exceed the number of effector molecules available. The pres\u00ad\nence of spare receptors increases sensitivity to the agonise because \nthe likelihood of a drug-receptor interaction increases in propor\u00ad\ntion to the number of receptors available. (For contrast, the system \ndepicted in Figure 2-1, pands B and C, does not have spare recep\u00ad\ntors, because the EC50 and the K.i are equal.) \nAGONISTS, PARTIAL AGONISTS, BIASED \nAGONISTS, &: INVERSE AGONISTS \nCurrent concepts of drug-receptor interactions consider the recep\u00ad\ntor to have at least two states-active and inactive.

Explanations for this \nphenomenon are discussed in the text. \nalternativdy, an equilibrium state might exist with some recep\u00ad\ntors in the activated state and most in the inactive state (R. + R;; \nFigure 2-4). Many receptor systems exhibit some activity in the \nabsence of ligand, suggesting that some fraction of the recep\u00ad\ntor pool is always in the activated state. Activity in the absence \nof ligand is called constitutive activity. A full agonist is a drug \ncapable of fully activating the effector system when it binds to the \nreceptors. In the modd system illwtrated in Figure 2-4, a full ago\u00ad\nnist has high affinity for the activated receptor conformation, and \nsufficiently high concentrations result in all the receptors achieving \nthe activated state (R,, +DJ. A partial agonist produces less than \nthe full effect, even when it has saturated the receptors (R. + DP\" + \nR; + D PJ, presumably by combining with both receptor conforma\u00ad\ntions, but favoring the active state. In the presence of a full agonist, \na partial agonist acts as an inhibitor. In this model, neutral antag\u00ad\nonists bind with equal affinity to the R; and R. states, preventing \nbinding by an agonist and preventing any deviation from the levd \nof constitutive activity. In contrast, inverse agonists have a higher \naffinity for the inactive R; state than for R. and decrease or abolish \nany constitutive activity. Biased agonism denotes the ability of \ndifferent agonists in a drug group (eg, ~-adrenoceptor ligands) to \nproduce somewhat different {biased) downstream effects despite \nactivating the same receptors. The mechanism of this effect is not \nunderstood but may involve changes induced in the conformation \nof the receptor that differ with different agonists. \nANTAGONISTS \nA. Competitive and Irreversible Pharmacologic \nAntagonists \nCompetitive antagonists are drugs that bind to, or very close to, the \nagonist receptor site in a reversible way without activating the effec\u00ad\ntor system for that receptor. Neutral antagonists bind the receptor \nwithout shifting the ratio ofR,, to R; {Figure 2-4).

In the R1 \nstate, it is inactive and produces no effect, even when combined \nwith a drug (D) molecule. In the R., state, it activates its effectors and \nan effect is recorded, even in the absence of ligand. In the absence \nof drug, the equilibrium between R; and Ra determines the degree \nof constitutive activity. Lower: A full agonist drug (D1) has a much \nhigher affinity for the R., than for the R; receptor conformation, and a \nmaximal effect is produced at sufficiently high drug concentration. \nA partial agonist drug (Dpo) has somewhat greater affinity for the R. \nthan for the Rt conformation and produces less effect, even at saturat\u00ad\ning concentrations. A neutral antagonist (D.ntl binds with equal affin\u00ad\nity to both receptor conformations and prevents binding of agonist. \nAn inverse agonist (D1) binds much more avidly to the R1 receptor \nconformation, prevents conversion to the R., state, and reduces \nconstitutive activity. (Reproduced with permission from Katzung BG, \nVanderah TW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15th ed. New York, NY: \nMcGraw Hiii; 2021.) \nof a competitive antagonist, the dose-response curve for an agonist \nis shifted to higher doses {ie, horizontally to the right on the dose \naxis), but the same maximal effect is reached (Figure 2-SA). The \nagonist, if given in a high enough concentration, can displace the \nantagonist and fully activate the receptors. In contrast, an irrevers\u00ad\nible antagonist causes a downward shift of the maximum, with no \nshift of the curve on the dose axis unless spare receptors are present \n{Figure 2-SB). Unlike the effects of a competitive antagonist, the \neffects of an irreversible antagonist cannot be overcome by adding \nmore agonist. Competitive antagonists increase the ED50; irrevers\u00ad\nible antagonists do not {unless spare receptors are present). A non\u00ad\ncompetitive antagonist that acts at an allosteric site on the receptor \n{see Figure 1-1) may bind reversibly or irreversibly; a noncompeti\u00ad\ntive antagonist that acts at the receptor site binds irreversibly."

Chemical Antagonists \nA chemical antagonist interacts directly with the drug being antag\u00ad\nonized to remove it or to prevent it from binding to its target. \nA chemical antagonist does not depend on interaction with the \nagonist's receptor (although such interaction may occur). Com\u00ad\nmon examples of chemical antagonists are dimercaprol, a chela\u00ad\ntor of lead and some other toxic metals, and pralidoxime, which \ncombines avidly with the phosphorus in organophosphate cholin\u00ad\nesterase inhibitors. \nSKILL KEEPER: ALLOSTERIC ANTAGONISTS \n(SEE CHAPTER 1) \nDescribe the difference between a pharmacolog/c antagonist \nand an allosteric Inhibitor. How could you differentiate these two \nexperimentally? The Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of \nthe chapter. \nTHERAPEUTIC INDEX & THERAPEUTIC \nWINDOW \nThe therapeutic index is the ratio of the TD50 (or LD5o) to the \nED50, determined from quanta! dose-response curves. The thera\u00ad\npeutic index represents an estimate of the safi:ty of a drug, because a very safe drug might be expected to have a very large toxic dose \nand a much smaller effective dose. For example, in Figure 2-2, \nthe ED50 is approximately 3 mg, and the LD50 is approximately \n150 mg. The therapeutic index is therefore approximately 150/3, or \n50, in mice. Obviously, a full range of toxic doses cannot be ethically \nstudied in humans. Furthermore, factors such as the varying slopes \nof dose-response curves make this estimate a poor safi:ty index even \nin animals. \nThe therapeutic window, a more clinically useful index of \nsafety, describes the dosage range between the minimum effective \ntherapeutic concentration or dose, and the minimum toxic concen\u00ad\ntration or dose. For example, if the average minimum therapeutic \nplasma concentration of theophylline is 8 mg/L and toxic effects \nare observed at 18 mg/L, the therapeutic window is S-18 mg/L. \nBoth the therapeutic index and the therapeutic window depend on \nthe specific therapeutic and toxic effects used in the determination. \nSIGNALING MECHANISMS \nOnce an agonist drug has bound to its receptor, some effector mech\u00ad\nanism is activated. The receptor-effector system may be an enzyme in \nthe intracellular space (eg, soluble guanylyl cyclase, a target of nitric \noxide} or in the membrane or extracellular space (eg, acetylcholin\u00ad\nesterase). Neurotransmitter reuptake transporters (eg, the serotonin \ntransporter, SERT; and the dopamine transporter, DAT) are recep\u00ad\ntors for many drugs, fur example, antidepressants and cocaine. Most \nantiarrhythmic drugs target voltage-activated ion channels in the \nmembrane fur sodium, potassium, or calcium. For the largest group \nof drug-receptor interactions, the drug is present in the extracel\u00ad\nlular space, whereas the effector mechanism resides inside the cell \nand modifies some intracellular process. These classic drug-receptor \ninteractions involve signaling across the membrane. Five major types \nof transmembrane-signaling mechanisms fur receptor-effector sys\u00ad\ntems have been defined (Figure 2-6, Table 2-1). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

For example, the molecule \nP-arrestin has been shown to bind to an intracellular loop of the \nP adrenoccptor when the rea:ptor is continuously activated.

No information is given regarding the maximal antihyperten\u00ad\nsive response to either drug. Similarly, no information about \nhalf-life or toxicity is provided. The fact that a given response \nis achieved with a smaller dose of blocker A indicates only \nthat A is more potent than B in the ratio of 500:5. The answer \nis B. \n2. Precise quantitation is possible with both types of dose\u00ad\nresponse curves. Quantal dose-response curves show the fre\u00ad\nquency of occurrence of a specified response, which may be \ntherapeutically effective (ED) or toxic (TD). Thus, quantal \nstudies are used to determine the therapeutic index and the \nvariation in sensitivity to the drug in the population studied. \nGraded (not quantal) dose-response curves are used to deter\u00ad\nmine maximal efficacy (maximal response). The answer is C. \n3. Drug A produces 50% of its maximal effect at a lower dose \nthan either B or C and thus is the most potent; drug C is the \nleast potent. However, drug A, a partial agonist, is less effica\u00ad\ncious than drugs B and C. The answer is D. \n4. Choices involving chemical or physiologic antagonism arc \nincorrect because novamine is said to act at the same recep\u00ad\ntors as acetylcholine. When given alone, the novamine effect \nis opposite to that of acetylcholine; so choice C is incorrect. \n\"Spare receptor agonist\" is a nonsense distracter. The answer \nis B. \n5. There is no difference in location between \"spare\" and other \nreceptors. Spare receptors may be defined as those that are not \nneeded for binding drug to achieve the maximal effect.

The binding of a full agonist decreases as the concentration of \na partial agonist is increased to very high levels. As the partial \nagonist displaces more and more of the full agonist, the per\u00ad\ncentage of receptors that bind the full agonist drops to zero, \nthat is, Curve 5. The answer is E. \n9. Curve 1 describes the response of the system when a full ago\u00ad\nnist is displaced by increasing concentrations of partial ago\u00ad\nnist. This is because the increasing percentage of receptors \nbinding the partial agonist finally produce the maximal effect \ntypical of the partial agonist. The answer is A. \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: IO. Partial agonists, like full agonists, bind 100% of their recep\u00ad\ntors when present in a high enough concentration. Therefore, \nthe binding curve (but not the effect curve) will go to 100%. \nIf the effect curve is Curve 4 and many spare receptors are \npresent, the binding curve must be displaced to the right of \nCurve 4 (~ > EC50).

They do not prevent binding of the agonist. In \ncontrast pharmaco/ogic antagonists bind to the agonist \nsite and prevent access of the agonist. The difference can be \ndetected experimentally by evaluating competition between \nthe binding of radioisotoplcally labeled antagonist and the \nagonist.

The \nvd of drugs that are normally bound to plasma proteins such as \nalbumin can be altered by Uver disease (through reduced protein \nsynthesis} and kidney disease (through urinary protein loss}. On the \nother hand, if a drug is avidly bound in peripheral tissues, the drug's \nconcentration in plasma may drop to very low values even though \nthe total amount in the body is large. As a result, the vd may greatly \nexceed the total physical volume of the body. For example, 50,000 L \nis the average vd for the drug quinacrine in persons whose total \nphysical body volume is 70 L. \nCLEARANCE \nClearance (CL) relates the rate of elimination to the plasma \nconcentration: \nCL = Rate of elimination of drug \nPlasma drug concentration \n(Units = Volume per unit time) (2) \nFor a drug eliminated with first-order kinetics, clearance is a \nconstant; that is, the ratio of rate of elimination to plasma con\u00ad\ncentration is the same over a broad range of plasma concentration \n(Figure 3--2). As in the case ofVd, clearance is sometimes expr~ed \nas CL per kg of body weight. The magnitudes of clearance for \ndifferent drugs range from a small percentage of the blood flow \nto a maximum of the total blood flow to the organs of elimina\u00ad\ntion.

Thus, the clearance of a drug that is very \neffectively extracted by an organ (ie, the blood is completely cleared \nof the drug as it passes through the organ) is often flow-limited. \nFor such a drug, the total clearance from the body is a function \nof blood flow through the eliminating organ and is limited by the \nblood flow to that organ. In this situation, other conditions-car\u00ad\ndiac disease, or other drugs that change blood flow-may have \nmore dramatic effects on clearance than disease of the organ of \nelimination.

The dosing rate computed fur maintenance dosage is \nthe average dose per unit time. When performing such calcula\u00ad\ntions, make certain that the units are in agreement throughout. \nFor example, if clearance is given in mUmin, the resulting dosing \nrate is a per-minute rate. Because convenience of administration is \ndesirable for chronic therapy, doses should be given orally if pos\u00ad\nsible and only once or a few times per day. The size of the daily \ndose (dose per minute x 60 min/h x 24 h/d) is a simple extension \nof the preceding information. The number of doses to be given \nper day is usually determined by the half-life of the drug and the \ndifference between the minimum therapeutic and toxic concentra\u00ad\ntions (see Therapeutic Wmdow, below). \nIf it is important to maintain a concentration above the mini\u00ad\nmum therapeutic level at all times, either a larger dose is given at \nlong intervals or smaller doses at shorter intervals. If the difference \nbetween the toxic and therapeutic concentrations is small, then \nsmaller and more frequent doses must be administered to prevent \ntoxicity. B. Loading Dosage \nIf the therapeutic concentration must be achieved rapidly and the \nVd is large, a large loading dose may be needed at the onset of \ntherapy. This can be calculated from the following equation: \nL din d _ Vd x Desired plasma concentration (S) oa g ose -8. .1 b\"I\" 1oava1 a 1 1tY \nNote that clearance does not enter into this computation. If the \nloading dose is large CVc1 much larger than blood volume), the dose \nshould be given slowly to prevent toxicity due to excessively high \nplasma levels during the distribution phase. \nTHERAPEUTIC WINDOW \nThe therapeutic window is the safe range between the minimum \ntherapeutic concentration and the minimum toxic concentra\u00ad\ntion of a drug. These data are used to determine the acceptable \nrange of plasma levels when designing a dosing regimen. Thus, the \nminimum effective concentration usually determines the desired \ntrough levels of a drug given intermittently, whereas the mini\u00ad\nmum toxic concentration determines the permissible peak plasma \nconcentration. For example, the drug theophylline has a therapeu\u00ad\ntic concentration range of 8-20 mg/L but may he toxic at concen\u00ad\ntrations of more than 15-20 mg/L. The therapeutic window for a \nparticular patient might thus be 8-16 mg/L (Figure 3-6).

            "Text": "ADJUSTMENT OF DOSAGE WHEN \nELIMINATION IS ALTERED BY DISEASE \nRenal disease or reduced cardiac output often reduces the clear\u00ad\nance of drugs that depend on renal elimination. Alteration of \nclearance by liver disease is less common but may also occur. \nImpairment of hepatic clearance occurs (for high extraction drugs) \nwhen liver blood flow is reduced, as in heart failure, and in severe \ncirrhosis and other forms ofliver failure. Because it is important in \nthe elimination of drugs, assessing renal function is important in \nestimating dosage in patients. The most important renal variable \nin drug elimination is glomerular filtration rate (GFR); and creati\u00ad\nnine clearance (Cler) is a convenient approximation of GFR. In a \npatient with renal impairment, the dosage of a drug eliminated by \nthe kidneys may be corrected by multiplying the average dosage \nfor a normal person times the ratio of the patient's altered cre\u00ad\natinine clearance (CLJ to normal creatinine clearance (approxi\u00ad\nmately 100 mL/min, or 6 Uh in a young adult). \nPatient's CL Corrected dosage = Average dosage x 1 OO U . er (6) m min \nThis simplified approach ignores nonrenal routes of clearance \nthat may be significant. If a drug is cleared partly by the kidney \nand partly by other routes, Equation 6 should be applied to the \npart of the dose that is eliminated by the kidney. For example, if \na drug is 50% cleared by the kidney and 50% by the liver and the \nnormal dosage is 200 mg/d, the hepatic and renal elimination rates \nare each 100 mg/d at steady state. Therefore, the corrected dosage \nin a patient with a creatinine clearance of 20 mUmin will be: \nDosage= 100 mg/d (liver) + 100 mg/d \n20 mUmin (kid ) (7) x 100 mUmin ney \nDosage = 100 mg/d + 20 mg/d = 120 mg/d \nRenal function is altered by many diseases and is often decreased \nin older patients.

In question 1, the data provided fur Mr Jones on \ndialysis is irrelevant, even though choice A. 238 Ud, is the \ncorrect clearance while on dialysis. By definition, clearance is \ncalculated by dividing the rate of elimination by the plasma \nconcentration: \nRate in = rate out (elimination rate) at steady state (ss) \nCL= rate in \ncp(ss) \nCL= 1000 mg/24 h \n1.4mg/L \nCL=29.8Uh \nThe answer is B. \n2.

Induction of phase I metabolizing enzymes will decrease \nthe half-life of substrates of these enzymes. P450 enzyme \ninduction has no effect on volume of distribution. Hepatic \nextraction, the first-pass effect, and clearance for CYP3A4 \nsubstrates will be increased by inducers. However, the extrac\u00ad\ntion of verapamil is already equal to the hepatic blood flow, so \nfurther increase in metabolism will not increase clearance of \nthis drug. The answer is E. \n4. By inspection of the data in the table, it is clear that the \nsteady-state plasma concentration is approximately 4 mg/L. \nNone of the measured concentrations is equal to one half \nof the steady state value; so the half-life is not immediately \napparent. However, according to the constant infusion princi\u00ad\nple (Figure 3-3), 2 half-lives are required to reach 75% of the \nfinal concentration; 75% (3.0 mg/L) of the final steady-state \nconcentration was reached at 4 h. If 4 h equals 2 half-lives, \nthe half-life must be 2 h. Rearranging the equation for main\u00ad\ntenance dosing (dosing rate= CL x Cp), it can be determined \nthat the clearance (CL) = dosing rate/plasma concentration \n(c;J, or 2.5 Uh. The volume of distribution (V .J can be \ncalculated from the half-life equation (t112 = 0.693 x Yd/CL) \nand is equal to 7.2 L. This drug follows first-order kinetics, \nas indicated by the progressive approach to the steady-state \nplasma concentration. The answer is D. \n5. For a drug with first-order kinetics, the approach of the drug \nplasma concentration to steady-state concentration during \ncontinuous infusion follows a stereotypical curve (Figure 3-3) \nthat rises rapidly at first and gradually reaches a plateau. It \nreaches 50% of steady state at 1 half-life, 75% at 2 half-lives, \n87.5% at 3, 93.75% at 4, and progressively halves the differ\u00ad\nence between its current level and 100% of steady state with \neach half-life. The answer is E, 32 h, or 4 half-lives. CHAPTER 3 Pharmacokinetics 33 \n6.

Let Z be the amount in the blood plasma. If the amount \nin the rest of the body is 100 times greater, then the total \namount in the body is lOlZ. The concentration in the blood \nplasma (Cp) is Z/4 L. According to the definition: \nV _ amount in body d-Cp \nThe answer is E. \n8. According to the curve that relates plasma concentration to \ninfusion time {Figure 3-3), a drug reaches 50% of its final \nsteady-state concentration in 1 half-life, 75% in 2 half-lives, \netc. From 9 AM to 1 PM is 4 h, or 2 half-lives. Therefore, the \nmeasured concentration at 1 PM is 75% of the steady-state \nvalue (0.75 x Cy(ai)\u00b7 The steady-state concentration is 3 mg/L \ndivided by 0.7:>, or 4 mg/L. The answer is B. \n9. According to the curve that relates the decline of plasma con\u00ad\ncentration to time as the drug is eliminated (Figure 3-3), the \nplasma concentration of morphine was 2 times higher imme\u00ad\ndiately after administration than at the time of the measure\u00ad\nment, which occurred 3 h, or 1 half-life, later. Therefore, the \ninitial plasma concentration was 0.5 mg/L. Since the amount \nin the body at any time is equal to Yd x plasma concentration \n(text Equation 1), the amount injected was 200 L x 0.5 mg/L, \nor 100 mg. The answer is C. \n10.

Phase I Reactions \nPhase I reactions include oxidation (especially by the cytochrome \nP450 group of enzymes, also called mixed-function oxiclases}, \nreduction, deamination, and hydrolysis. Examples of phase I drug \nsubstrates are listed in Table 4-1. Phase I enzymes are found in \nhigh concentrations in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the \nliver and in lower concentrations in some other tissues. They are \nnot highly selective in their substrates, so a relatively small num\u00ad\nber of P450 isoforms are able to metabolize thousands of drugs. \nOf the drugs metabolized by phase I cytochrome P450s, approxi\u00ad\nmately 75% are metabolized by just two: CYP3A4/5 or CYP2D6. \nCYP3A4 and CYP3A5 alone are responsible for the metabolism of \napproximately 50% of drugs. Nevertheless, some selectivity can be \ndetected, and optical enantiomers, in particular, are often metabo\u00ad\nlized at different rates. B. Phase II Reactions \nPhase II reactions are synthetic reactions that involve addition \n(conjugation) of subgroups to -OH, -NH2, and -SH func\u00ad\ntions on the drug molecule. The subgroups that are added include \nglucuronate, acetate, glutathione, glycine, sulfate, and methyl \ngroups. Most of these groups are relatively polar and make the \nproduct less lipid soluble than the original drug molecule. Examples \nof phase II reactions are listed in Table 4-2. Like phase I enzymes, \nphase II enzymes are not very selective. Drugs that are metabolized \nby both routes may undergo phase II metabolism before or after \nphase I. \nSITES OF DRUG METABOLISM \nThe most important organ for drug metabolism is the liver.

Some of this variation is due to genetic fac\u00ad\ntors (see Chapter 5). Most importantly, a variety of drugs may \ninduce or inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes to a significant \nextent. Smoking is a common cause of enzyme induction in the \nliver and lung and may increase the metabolism of some drugs. \nFor a few drugs, age or disease-related differences in drug metabo\u00ad\nlism are significant. In humans, gender is important for only a few \ndrugs. (For example, first-pass metabolism of ethanol is greater \nin men than in women.) Because the rate of biotransformation \nis often the primary determinant of clearance, variations in drug \nmetabolism must be considered carefully when designing or modi\u00ad\nfying a dosage regimen. \nA. Genetic Factors \nSeveral drug-metabolizing systems have long been known to dif\u00ad\nfer among families or populations in genetically determined ways. \nBecause recent advances in genomic techniques are making it pos\u00ad\nsible to screen for a huge variety of polymorphisms, it is expected \nthat pbarmacogenomics will become an important part of patient \nevaluation in the near future, influencing both drug choice and \ndrug dosing (see Chapter 5). \nB. Effects of Other Drugs \nCoadministration of certain agents may alter the disposition of \nmany drugs. Mechanisms include the following: \n1. Enzyme Induct/on-Induction (increased rate and extent \nof metabolism of drugs) usually results from increased synthesis CHAPTER 4 Drug Metabolism 37 \nof cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver as well as the cofactor, \nheme. Several cytoplasmic drug receptors have been identified that \nresult in activation of the genes for P450 isoforms. Drugs and other \nxenobiotics that increase enzyme activity are known as inducers. \nMany isozymes of the P450 family exist, and most inducers selec\u00ad\ntively increase one or more subgroups of these isozymes. Common \ninducers of a few of these isozymes and the drugs whose metabo\u00ad\nlism is increased are listed in Table 4-3. Several days are usually \nrequired to reach maximum induction; a similar amount of time \nis required to regress after withdrawal of the inducer. The most \ncommon strong inducers of drug metabolism are carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin. \n2. Enzyme Inhibition-A few common inhibitors and the drugs \nwhose metabolism is diminished are listed in Table 4-4. The \ninhibitors of drug metabolism most likely to be involved in serious \ndrug interactions are amiodarone, cimetidine, furanocoumarins \npresent in grapefruit juice, azole antifungals, and the HIV protease \ninhibitor ritonavir. Suicide inhibitors are drugs that are metabo\u00ad\nlized to products that irreversibly inhibit the metabolizing enzyme. \nSuch agents include ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, spironolac\u00ad\ntone, secobarbital, allopurinol, fluroxene, and propylthiouracil. \nMetabolism may also be decreased by pharmacodynamic factors \nsuch as a reduction in blood flow to the metabolizing organ (eg, \npropranolol reduces hepatic blood flow). \n3. lnhibhors of intestinal P-glycoprotein-MDR-l, also \nknown as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is an important modulator of \nintestinal drug transport and usually functions to expel drugs from \nthe intestinal mucosa into the lumen, thus contributing to pre\u00ad\nsystemic (first pass) elimination. P-gp and other members of the \nMD R family are also found in the blood-brain barrier and in drug\u00ad\nresistant cancer cells. Drugs that inhibit intestinal P-gp mimic drug \nmetabolism inhibitors by increasing bioavailability; coadministra\u00ad\ntion of P-gp inhibitors may result in toxic plasma concentrations \nTABLE 4-3 A partial list of drugs that significantly induce P450-mediated drug metabolism in humans. \nCYP Famlly lndumd Important lndumrs \n1 A2 Benzo[a]pyrene (from tobacco smoke), \ncarbamazepine, lansoprazole, omepra\u00ad\nzole, phenobarbftal, rlfampfn \n2C9 Barbiturates, especially phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, primidone, rifampin \n2C19 Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, rifampin \n2E1 Ethanol, isoniazid \n3M Barbiturates, carbamazepine, cortico\u00ad\nsteroids, efavlrenz, phenytoln, rlfampln, \npioglitazone, St John's wort \nSSRls, selectfve serotonin reuptake Inhibitors.

Important drugs that are normally expelled by P-gp (and are \ntherefore potentially more toxic when given with a P-gp inhibitor) \ninclude digoxin, cyclosporine, and saquinavir. \nTOXIC METABOLISM \nDrug metabolism is not synonymous with drug inactivation. \nSome drugs are converted to active products by metabolism. If \nthese products are toxic, severe injury may result under some cir\u00ad\ncumstances. An important example is acetaminophen when taken \nin large overdoses (Figure 4-1). Acetaminophen is conjugated to \nharmless glucuronide and sulfate metabolites when it is taken in \nrecommended doses by patients with normal liver function. If \na large overdose is taken, however, the phase II metabolic path\u00ad\nways are overwhdmed, and a phase I P4SO-dependent system \nconverts some of the drug to a reactive intermediate (N-acetyl-p\u00ad\nbenzoquinoneimine). This intermediate is conjugated with glu\u00ad\ntathione to a third harmless product if glutathione stores are \nadequate. If glutathione stores are depleted, however, the reactive \nintermediate combines with sulfhydryl groups on essential hepatic \ncell proteins, resulting in cdl death. Prompt administration of \nother sulfhydryl donors (eg, acetylcysteine) may be lifesaving after \nan overdose. In severe liver disease, stores of glucuronide, sulfate, \nand glutathione may be chronically depleted, making the patient \nmore susceptible to hepatic toxicity with near-normal doses of \nacetaminophen. Enzyme inducers (eg, ethanol) may increase acetaminophen toxicity because they increase phase I metabolism \nmore than phase II metabolism, thus resulting in increased pro\u00ad\nduction of the reactive metabolite. \n(Phase II) (Phase II) \nAc-glucuronide 1111( Ac Ac-sulfate ~ l Cytochrome P450 ~ ~ -(Phase I) \ne Reactive electrophilic \ncompound \n(Ac*) \nGSHi ~ell macro~olecules (protein) \nGs-Ac* Ac*-protein t \\ \nt \\ \nAc-mercapturate Hepatic cell death \nFIGURE 4-1 Metabolism of acetaminophen (Ac) to harmless \nconjugates or to toxic metabolites.

The identification of \nspecific genes that control the expression of the molecules involved \nand the variants (polymorphisms) of those genes has become the \nsubject of intense research over the last 20 years. At present, data \nare available regarding the variants of the genes for some phase I Transporters Immune system \nand phase II enzymes and some drug transporters. Examples of \nthese genetic determinants of drug metabolism, transport, and \nimmunologic drug reactions are the subject of this chapter. Impor\u00ad\ntant terms are defined in the High-Yield Terms To Learn table on \nthe next page. \nPHASE I ENZYMES \nCYP2D6, CYP2Cl9, CYP3A4/5, and dihydropyrimidine dehy\u00ad\ndrogenase are among the drug-metabolizing enzymes most care\u00ad\nfully studied to date (Table 5-1). \nA.CYP2D6 \nThis enzyme is responsible for the hepatic metabolism of \n20-25% of commonly used drugs. More than 100 polymor\u00ad\nphisms of the CYP2D6 gene have been discovered, but only 9 \nare common. CYP2D6 polymorphisms are especially impor\u00ad\ntant in patients receiving codeine because this enzyme converts \ncodeine to its active metabolite, morphine. CYP2D6 alleles with \ndecreased function (PM alleles) result in reduced analgesia from \nnormal doses of codeine. In contrast, several deaths due to exces\u00ad\nsive effect, including respiratory depression, have been reported \nin children who apparently carried ultrarapid metabolizer alleles \n(UM alleles}. \n41"

What is the mech\u00ad\nanism of acetaminophen toxidty and how is it treated? The \nSkill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nQUESTIONS \nI. A 59-year-old man with acute coronary syndrome is admitted \nto the hospital for emergency percutaneous insertion of a cor\u00ad\nonary scent.

Clopidogrd is a prodrug that must be metabolized to an active \nplatdet-inhibiting metabolite by CYP2C19. Poor metaboliz\u00ad\ners achieve inadequate platelet inhibition, and EMs and UMs \nmay have excess effect and bleed. Prasugrel and ticagrelor do \nnot require P450 activation and are not subject to this risk. \nThe answer is A. \n2. CYP2D6\"' lx3 is a gain-of-function allde enhanced by 3 cop\u00ad\nies (\" x3 \") and is associated with increased effect and toxicity of \ncodeine. CYP2CJ9*2 is a nonfunctional allde associated with \nreduced efficacy of clopidogrel. CYP2C!r 3 with a reduced \nfunction allele of VCORCJ is associated with reduced war\u00ad\nfarin clearance. UGTJAJ* 28 is a reduced function allele for \nuridine 5'-diphospho-(UDP) glucuronosyltransferase and \nenhances irinotecan toxicity. 5-Fluorouracil is cleared by \ndihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The DPYD\u20222A \nallde is nonfunctional. The answer is D. \n3. Poor metabolizers of the CYP2D6\"' 3 genotype are prone \nto reduced efficacy of codeine. Poor metabolizers of the \nCYP3A5*3 type show reduced tacrolimus clearance. Simv\u00ad\nastatin toxicity (myopathy) is enhanced in SLCOJBJ poor \nmetabolizers. Enhanced metabolizers of the HLA-B*57:01 \ntype are prone to abacavir rashes and flucloxacillin liver dam\u00ad\nage. The answer is C. \n4. CYP2D6\"' 3 is associated with reduced codeine efficacy. \nCYP2Dl!r2 results in reduced clopidogrel conversion to its \nactive metabolite. TPM'I\" 2 is associated with decreased clear\u00ad\nance of 6-mercaptopurine and increased toxicity. UGTJAJ* 28 \nresults in decreased clearance and increased toxicity ofSN-38, \nthe active metabolite of irinotecan. G6PD-(A)-Canton is a \nreduced function allele of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydro\u00ad\ngenase gene that decreases intracellular stores of glutathione, \nincreasing the risk of hemolysis but reducing susceptibility to \nmalaria. The answer is E. \n5. As noted in answer 4, SNPs in CYP2D6 may increase or \ndecrease the efficacy and toxicity of codeine because the \nCYP2D6 enzyme is responsible for conversion of codeine to \nits active metabolite, morphine. CYP2D6\"' I xN and * 2xN are \ngain-of-function alldes with increased copy number polymor\u00ad\nphisms that result in more efficient conversion to morphine \nand increased risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. \nThe answer is A. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Recent research indi\u00ad\ncates that the sacral fibers are actually sympathetic cholinergic fibers \n(see Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15E). The sympathetic pregan\u00ad\nglionic fibers originate in the thoracic (Tl-T12), lumbar (Ll-L5), \nand if confirmed, the S2-S4 segments of the cord. \nMost of the sympathetic ganglia are located in two paravertebral \nchains that lie along the sides of the spinal column in the thorax \nand abdomen. A few (the prevertebral ganglia) are located on the \nanterior aspect of the abdominal aorta. Most of the parasympa\u00ad\nthetic ganglia are located in the organs innervated and more distant \nfrom the spinal cord. Because of the locations of the ganglia, the \npreganglionic sympathetic fibers are short and the postganglionic \nfibers are long. The opposite is true for the parasympathetic system: \npreganglionic fibers are longer and postganglionic fibers are short. \nSome receptors that respond to autonomic transmitters and \ndrugs receive no innervation. These include muscarinic receptors \non the endothdium of blood vessels, some presynaptic receptors \non nerve endings, and, in some species, the adrenoceptors on apo\u00ad\ncrine sweat glands and <Lz and ~ adrenoceptors on blood vessd \nsmooth muscle. NEUROTRANSMITTER ASPECTS \nOF THE ANS \nThe synthesis, storage, rdease, receptor interactions, and termina\u00ad\ntion of action of the neurotransmitters all contribute to the action \nof autonomic drugs (Figure 6--2). \nA. Cholinergic Transmission \nAcetylcholine (ACh) is the primary transmitter in all autonomic \nganglia and at the synapses between parasympathetic postgangli\u00ad\nonic neurons and their effector cells. It is the transmitter at post\u00ad\nganglionic sympathetic neurons to the thermoregulatory sweat \nglands. It is also the primary transmitter at the somatic (voluntary) \nskeletal muscle neuromuscular junction (Figure 6--1). \n1. Synthesis and srorage-Acetylcholine is synthesized in the \nnerve terminal by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) \nfrom acetyl-CoA (produced in mitochondria) and choline (trans\u00ad\nported across the cell membrane) (Figure 6--2). The rate-limiting \nstep is probably the transport of choline into the nerve terminal. \nThis transport can be inhibited by the research drug hemicho\u00ad\nlinium. Acetylcholine is activdy transported into its vesicles for \nstorage by the vesicle-associated transporter, VAT. This process \ncan be inhibited by another research drug, vesamicol. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Release of acetylchollne-Release of twlSmitter stores \nfrom vesicles in the nerve ending requires the entry of calcium \nthrough calcium channels and triggering of an interaction between \nSNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide--sensitive-factor attachment \nprotein receptor} proteins. SNARE proteins include v~NARES \nassociated with the vesicles (V AMPs, vesicle-associated membrane \nproteins: synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin) and t-SNARE proteins \nassociated with the nerve terminal membr.me (SNAPs, synapto\u00ad\nsome-associated proteins: SNAP25, syntaxin, and others). Th.is \ninteraction results in docking of the vesicle to the terminal mem\u00ad\nbrane and, with influx of calcium, fusion of the membranes of the \nvesicles with the nerve-ending membranes, the opening of a pore \nto the extracellular space, and the release of the stored transmit\u00ad\nter. The several types ofLotulinum tozina arc able to enter cho\u00ad\nlinergic nerve terminals and enzymatically alter synaptobrevin or \none of the other docking or fusion proteins to prevent the release \nprocess. 3. Tennlnation of action of acetykhollne-The action of \nacetylcholine in the synapse is normally terminated by metabolism \nto acetate and choline by the enzyme acetyfchollnatuue in the \nsynaptic deft. Th.is esterase is anchored to the postsynaptic cell but \nacts extracellularly. The products are not excn:ted but are recycled \nin the body. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is an important \ntherapeutic (and potentially toxic) effi:ct of several dru~. \n4.

However, because botulinum toxin is a vety large \nmolecule and diffiaes very slowly, it can be wed by injection fur \nrelatively selective local effCcts at the site of administration."

In spite of this \nproperty, it is able to enter cholinergic nerve endings from the \nextracellular space and inhibit the release of acetylcholine. \nHow might it cross the lipid membrane ba\"ier? The Skil I \nKeeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nB. Adrenerglc Transmission \nNorepinephrine (NE) is the primary transmitter at the sympa\u00ad\nthetic postganglionic neuron-effector cdl synapses in most tissues. \nImportant exceptions include sympathetic fibers to thermoregula\u00ad\ntory (eccrine) sweat glands and probably vasodilator sympathetic \nfibers in skeletal muscle, which release acerylcholine. Dopamine \nmay be a vasodilator transmitter in renal blood vessels, but norepi\u00ad\nnephrine is a vasoconstrictor in these vessels. \n1. Synthesis and storage-The synthesis of dopamine and \nnorepinephrine requires several steps (Figure 6-2). After transport \nacross the cell membrane, ryrosine is hydroxylated by tyrosine \nhyd.roxylase (the rate-limiting step) to DOPA (dihydroxyphe\u00ad\nnylalanine), decarboxylated to dopamine, and (inside the vesicle) \nAcety1-CoA + Choline \nilchArl \nA Ch \nd) \n/ \nSNAPs -~-+-1--1 Vesamlcol \nBotulinum hydroxylated to norepinephrine. Tyrosine hydrox:ylase can be \ninhibited by metyrosinc:. Norepinephrine and dopamine are \ntransported into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter \n(VMAT) and are stored there. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is pres\u00ad\nent on mitochondria in the adrenergic nerve ending and inactivates \na portion of the dopamine and norepinephrine in the cytoplasm. \nTherefore, MAO inhibiton may increase the stores of these trans\u00ad\nmitters and other amines in the nerve endings (see Chapter 30). \nVMA T can be inhibited by reserpine, resulting in depletion of \ntransmitter stores. \n2. Release and termination ol action-Dopamine and nor\u00ad\nepinephrine are released from their nerve endings by the same \ncalcium-dependent mechanism responsible for acetylcholine \nrelease (see prior discussion). In contrast to cholinergic neurons, \nnoradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons lack receptors for bot\u00ad\nulinum and do not transport this toxin into the nerve terminal. \nTermination of action is also quite different from the cholinergic \nsystem. Metabolism is not responsible for termination of action \nof the synaptic catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine. \nRather, diffusion and reuptake (especially uptake-I, Figure 6-2, \nby the norepinephrine transporter, NET, or the dopamine trans\u00ad\nporter, DAT) reduce their concentration in the synaptic cleft \nand stop their action. Outside the cleft, these transmitters can \nbe metabolized-by MAO and catechol-0-methyltransferase \n(COMT)-and the products of these enzymatic reactions are \nCocaine, \nTCA NORADRENERGIC \nDOPA \nD t . opam1ne \n->---+-1--1 Reserpine \nNE ca2+ \nGuanethldlne \nNE\"\"\"\"\"==;......_ Diffusion, \n~ v metabolism \n.....,....,-=----Postsynaptic __ __,,,,.,,_~ \nmembrane \nFIGURE 6-2 Characteristics of transmitter synthesis, storage, release, and termination of action at cholinergic and noradrenergic nerve termi\u00ad\nnals are shown from the top downward.

Determination of the 24-h excretion of metaneph\u00ad\nrinc, normetanephrine, 3-metboxy-4-hyd.roxymandelic acid \n(VMA), and other metabolites provides a measure of the total \nbody production of catecholamines, a determination useful in \ndiagnosing conditions such as phcochromocytoma. Inhibition of \nMAO increases stores of catecholamines in nerve endings and has \nboth therapeutic and toxic potential. Inhibition of COMT in the \nbrain is useful in Parkinson disease (see Chapter 28). \n3. Drug effe.cts on adrenergic transmission-Drugs that \nblock norepinephrine synthesis (eg, metyrosine) or catecholamine \nstorage (eg, reserpine) or release (eg, guanethidine) were used in \ntreatment of several diseases (eg, hypertension) because they block \nsympathetic but not parasympathetic functions. They are no longer \nin common use. Other drugs promote catecholamine release (eg, \nthe amphetamines) and predictably cause sympathomimetic effects. \nC. Cotransmitters \nMany (probably all) autonomic nerves have transmitter vesicles \nthat contain other transmitter molecules in addition to the primary \nagents (acetylcholine or norepinephrine) previously described. \nThese cotransmitters may be localized in the same vesicles as the \nprimary transmitter or in a separate population of vesicles. Sub\u00ad\nstances recognized to date as cotransmitters include ATP (adenos\u00ad\nine ttiphosphate), enkephalins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, \nneuropepti.de Y, substance P, neurotensin, somatostatin, and \nothers. Their main role in autonomic function appears to involve \nmodulation of synaptic transmission. The same substances func\u00ad\ntion as primary transmitters in other synapses. \nANS RECEPTORS \nThe major receptor systems in the ANS include cholinoceptors, \nadrenoceptors, and dopamine receptors, which have been studied \nin detail. The receptors for the numerous cotransmitter substances \nhave not been as fully characterized. \nA. Cholinoceptors \nAlso referred to as cholinc:rgic: receptors, these molecules respond \nto acetylcholine and its analogs. Cholinoceptors are subdivided as \nfollows (Table 6-1): CHAPTER 6 Introduction to Autonomic Pharmacology 51 \nJ. Muscarinic receptors-As their name suggests, these recep\u00ad\ntors respond to muscarine {an alkaloid) as well as to acetylcholine. \nThe effects of activation of these receptors resemble those of post\u00ad\nganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation. Muscarinic receptors are \nlocated primarily on autonomic effector cells (including heart, vas\u00ad\ncular endothelium, smooth muscle, presynaptic nerve terminals, \nand exocrine glands). Evidence (including their genes) has been \nfound for five subtypes, of which three appear to be important in \nperipheral autonomic transmission. All five are G-protein-coupled \nreceptors (see Chapter 2). \n2. Nlcotlnlc receptors-These receptors are located on Na+ -K+ \nion channels and respond to acetylcholine and nicotine, another \nacetylcholine mimic (but not to muscarine) by opening the chan\u00ad\nnel. The two major nicotinic subtypes are located in ganglia and in \nskeletal muscle end plates. The nicotinic receptors are the primary \nreceptors for transmission at these sites. \nB. Adrenoceptors \nAlso referred to as adrenergic receptors, adrenoceptors are divided \ninto several subtypes (Table 6-2). \nJ. Alpha receptors- These arc located on vascular smooth mus\u00ad\ncle, presynaptic nerve terminals, blood platelets, fat cells (lipocytes \nor adipocytes), and neurons in the brain. Alpha receptors are fur\u00ad\nther divided into two major types, a1 and <Xi\u00b7 These two subtypes \nconstitute different families and use different G-coupling proteins. \n2. Beta receptors- These receptors are located on most types \nof smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, some presynaptic nerve termi\u00ad\nnals, and lipocytes. Beta receptors are divided into three major \nsubtypes, ~1, ~2, and ~3\u2022 These subtypes are rather similar and use \nthe same G,-coupling protein. \nC. Dopamine Receptors \nDopamine {D, DA) receptors are a subclass of adrenoceptors but \nwith rather different distribution and function. Dopamine recep\u00ad\ntors are especially important in the renal and splanchnic vessels \nand in the brain. Although at least five subtypes exist, the D1 \nsubtype appears to be the most important dopamine receptor on \nperipheral effector cells. D2 receptors are found on presynaptic \nTABLE 6-1 Characteristics of the most Important chollnoceptors In the peripheral nervous system. \nR.cepeor Location \nM, Nerve endings \nHeart, some nerve endings \nEffector cells: smooth muscle, glands, endothelium \nANS ganglia \nNeuromuscular end plate \ncAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP,, inositol trisphosphate.

D1, D2, and other types of dopamine receptors \noccur in large numbers in the CNS. \nEFFECTS OF ACTIVATING AUTONOMIC \nNERVES \nEach division of the ANS has specific effects on organ systems. \nThese effects, summarized in Table 6-3, should be memorized. \nDually innervated organs such as the iris of the eye and the \nsinoatrial node of the hean receive both sympathetic and parasym\u00ad\npathetic innervation . The pupil has a natural, intrinsic diameter \nto which it returns when both divisions of the ANS are blocked. \nPharmacologic ganglion blockade, therefore, causes it to move to \nits intrinsic size. Similarly, the cardiac sinus node pacemaker has \nan intrinsic rate {about 100-110/min) in the absence of both ANS \ninputs. How will these variables change (increase or decrease) if the \nganglia are blocked? The answer is predictable if one knows which \nsystem is dominant. Normally, both the pupil and, at rest, the sino\u00ad\natrial node are dominated by the parasympathetic system. Thus, \nblockade of both systems, with removal of the dominant PANS and \nnondominant SANS effects, result in mydriasis and tachycardia. \nNONADRENERGIC, NONCHOLINERGIC \nTRANSMISSION \nSome nerve fibers in autonomic effector tissues do not show the \nhistochemical characteristics of either cholinergic or adrenergic \nfibers. Some of these are motor fibers that cause the release of ATP \nand other purines related to it. Purine-evoked responses have been \nidentified in the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. \nOther motor fibers arc peptidcrgic , that is, they release peptides as \nthe primary transmitters {see list in earlier Cotransmitters section). \nSome fibers may release nitric oxide, a highly permeant gas that is \nnot stored but is synthesized on demand (see Chapter 19). \nOther nonadrenergi c, noncholinergic (NANC) fibers have the \nanatomic characteristics of sensory fibers and contain peptides, \nsuch as substance P, that arc stored in and released from the fiber terminals. These fibers have been termed \"sensory-efferent\" or \n\"sensory-local effector\" fibers because, when activated by a sensory \ninput, they are capable of releasing transmitter peptides from the \nsensory ending itself, from local axon branches, and from collaterals \nthat terminate in the autonomic ganglia. In addition to their neu\u00ad\nrotransmitter roles, these peptides are potent agonists in many auto\u00ad\nnomic effector tissues, especially smooth muscle (see Chapter 17). \nSITES OF AUTONOMIC DRUG ACTION \nBecause of the number of steps in the transmission of autonomic \ncommands from the CNS to the effector cells, there are many sites \nat which autonomic drugs may act. These sites include the CNS \ncenters; the ganglia; the postganglionic nerve terminals; the effector \ncell receptors; and the mechanisms responsible for transmitter syn\u00ad\nthesis, storage, release, and termination of action. The most selec\u00ad\ntive effect is achieved by drugs acting at receptors that mediate very \nselective actions (fable 6--4). Many natural and synthetic toxins \nhave significant effects on autonomic and somatic nerve function. \nINTEGRATION OF AUTONOMIC \nFUNCTION \nFunctional integration in the ANS is provided mainly through \nthe mechanism of negative feedback and is extremely important \nin determining the overall response to ANS transmitters and their \nanalogs. This process uses modulatory pre-and postsynaptic recep\u00ad\ntors at the local level and homeostatic reflexes at the system level. \nA. Local Integration \nLocal feedback control has been found at the level of the nerve end\u00ad\nings in all systems investigated. The best documented of these is \nthe negative feedback of norepinephrine upon its own release from \nadrenergic nerve terminals. This effect is mediated by <Xz receptors \nlocated on the presynaptic nerve membrane (Figure 6-3). \nPresynaptic receptors that bind the primary transmitter sub\u00ad\nstance and thereby regulate its release arc called autoreceptors. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Molecular Mechanisms of Action \n1. Muscarink mechanisms-Muscarinic receptors are G-protein\u00ad\ncoupled receptors (GPCRs} (Table 7-2). Gq\u00b7protein coupling \nof M1, M3, and Ms muscarinic receptors to phospholipase C, a \nmembrane-bound enzyme, leads to the release of the second mes\u00ad\nsengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate \n(IP~. DAG modulates the action of protein kinase C, an enzyme \nimportant in secretion, whereas IP 3 evokes the release of calcium \nfrom intracellular storage sites, which in smooth muscle results in \ncontraction. M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors couple to adenylyl \ncyclase through the inhibitory Gi-coupling protein. A third mech\u00ad\nanism couples the same M2 receptors via the ~ subunit of the G \nprotein to f.u:ilitate the opening of potassium channels in the heart \nand elsewhere. M4 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS} \nplay an important role in the basal ganglia, regulating dopamine' s \nactions in the initiation of movement. Ms receptors may be impor\u00ad\ntant in dopaminergic projection neurons of the CNS. M4 and Ms \nreceptors are found sparingly on the enteric neurons but have not \nbeen shown to play major roles in peripheral organs. \n2. Nicotinic mechanism-The nicotinic receptors are trans\u00ad\nmembrane channel proteins made up of five subunits. The nicotinic acetylcholine binding site is located between the alpha \nsubunit and one of the other subunits depending on the nicotinic \nprotein structure . The nicotinic channd protein is selective for \nsodium and potassium. When the receptor is activated, the chan\u00ad\nnd opens and depolarization of the cell occurs as a direct result of \nthe influx of sodium, causing an excitatory postsynaptic poten\u00ad\ntial (EPSP). If large enough, the EPSP evokes a propagated action \npotential in the surrounding membrane. The nicotinic receptors \non sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglion neurons as well as \nin the CNS (NN, also denoted NG for ganglion} differ slightly \nfrom those on neuromuscular end plates (NM). \nc. Tlssue and Organ Effects \nThe tissue and organ system effects of cholinomimetics are sum\u00ad\nmariu:d in Table 7-3. Note that vasodilation is not a parasym\u00ad\npathomimetic response (ie, it is not evoked by parasympathetic \nnerve discharge, even though directly acting cholinomimetics cause \nvasodilation). This vasodilation results from the release of endo\u00ad\nthelium-derived rdaxing factor (EDRF; nitric oxide and possibly \nother substances) in the vessels, mediated by uninnervated mus\u00ad\ncarinic receptors on the endothdial cells. Note also that decreased \nblood pressure evokes the baroreceptor reflex, resulting in strong \ncompensatory sympathetic discharge to the heart. As a result, injec\u00ad\ntions of small to moderate amounts of direct-acting muscarinic \ncholinomimetics often cause tllehycardia, whereas parasympathetic \n(vagal) nerve discharge to the heart causes hradycardia. Another \neffect seen with cholinomimetic drugs but not with parasympa\u00ad\nthetic nerve stimulation is thermoregulatory (eccrine) sweating; \nthis is a sympathetic cholinergic effect (see Chapter 6). \nThe tissue and organ levd effects of nicotinic ganglionic stimu\u00ad\nlation depend on the autonomic innervation of the organ involved. \nThe blood vessels are dominated by sympathetic innervation; \ntherefore, nicotinic receptor activation in ganglia results in vaso\u00ad\nconstriction mediated by sympathetic postganglionic noradren\u00ad\nergic nerve discharge. The gut is dominated by parasympathetic \ncontrol; nicotinic drugs increase motility and secretion because of \nincreased parasympathetic and other postganglionic cholinergic \nneuron discharge. Nicotinic neuromuscular end plate activation \nby direct-acting drugs results in fasciculations and spasm of the \nmuscles involved. Prolonged activation results in paralysis (see \nChapter 27), which is an important hazard of exposure to nicotine\u00ad\ncontaining and organophosphate insecticides. \nD. Clinical Use \nSeveral clinical conditions benefit from an increase in choliner\u00ad\ngic activity, including glaucoma, Sjogren syndrome, and loss of \nnormal cholinergic activity in the bowel and bladder. Direct\u00ad\nacting nicotinic agonists are used in medicine to assist smoking \ncessation (varenicline} and to produce skdetal muscle paralysis \n(succinylcboline, see Chapter 27). Indirect-acting agents are used \nwhen increased nicotinic activation is needed at the neuromuscu\u00ad\nlar junction (see discussion of myasthenia gravis}. Nicotine and \nrelated neonicotinoids are used as insecticides despite reported \ntoxic effects on bee colonies. Varenicline is a nicotinic partial ago\u00ad\nnist. It appears to reduce craving in persons addicted to nicotine \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "64 PART II Autonomic Drugs \nThese drugs are a.cetylcbolinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Neo\u00ad\nstigmine is a prototypic carbamate, whereas parathion, an impor\u00ad\ntant insecticide, is a prototypic organophosphate. A third class has \nonly one clinically useful member: edrophonium is an alcohol \n(not an ester) with a very shon duration of action. \nB. Mechanism of Action \nBoth carbamate and organophosphate inhibitors bind to cholin\u00ad\nesterase and undergo prompt hydrolysis. The alcohol portion of \nthe molecule is then released. The acidic portion (carbamate ion \nor phosphate ion) is released much more slowly from the enzyme \nactive site, preventing the binding and hydrolysis of endogenous \nacetylcholine. As a result, these drugs amplify acetylcholine effects \nwherever the transmitter is released. Edrophonium, though not an \nester, has sufficient affinity for the enzyme active site to similarly \nprevent access of acetylcholine for 5-15 min. After hydrolysis, \ncarbamates are released by cholinesterase over a period of 2-8 h. \nOrganophosphates are long-acting drugs; they form an extremely \nstable phosphate complex with the enzyme. After initial hydroly\u00ad\nsis, the phosphoric acid residue is released over periods of days to \nweeks. Recovery is due in part to synthesis of new enzyme. \nC. Effects \nBy inhibiting cholinesterase, these agents cause an increase in the \nconcentration, half-life, and actions of acetylcholine in synapses \nwhere acetylcholine is released physiologically. Therefore, the indi\u00ad\nrect agents have both muscarinic and nicotinic effects; dominant \neffects vary among the organ systems. Cholinesterase inhibitors do \nnot have significant actions at uninnervated sites (where acetylcho\u00ad\nline is not normally released, eg, vascular endothelial cells). \nD. Cllnlcal Uses \nThe clinical applications of the AChE inhibitors are predictable \nfrom a consideration of the organs and the diseases that ben\u00ad\nefit from an amplification of cholinergic activity. These applica\u00ad\ntions are summarized in the Drug Summary Table. Carbamates, \nwhich include nc:oatigmine, physmtigmine, pyridost.igmine, \nand ambenonium, are used far more often in therapeutics than \nare organophosphates. The treatment of myasthenia is especially \nimportant. (Because myasthenia is an autoimmune disorder, \ntreatment may also include thymectomy and immunosuppres\u00ad\nsant drugs.) Rivastigmine, a carbamate, and several other cho\u00ad\nlinesterase inhibitors are used exclusively in Alzheimer disease. A \nportion of their action may be due to other, unknown mecha\u00ad\nnisms. Although their effects in the CNS at recommended dosage \nare modest and temporary, these drugs are frequently used in this \ndevastating condition . Some carbamates (eg, carbuyl) are used in \nagriculture as insecticides. Two organophosphates used in medi\u00ad\ncine are malathion (a scabicide) and metrifonate (an antihelmin\u00ad\nthic agent). \nEdrophonium is used for the rapid reversal of nondepolar\u00ad\nizing neuromuscular blockade (see Chapter 27), in the diagno\u00ad\nsis of myasthenia, and in differentiating myasthenic crisis from cholinergic crisis in patients with this disease. Because cholinergic \ncrisis can result in muscle weakness like that of myasthenic crisis, \ndistinguishing the two conditions may be difficult. Administra\u00ad\ntion of a shon-acting cholinomimetic, such as edrophonium, will \nimprove muscle strength in myasthenic crisis but weaken it in cho\u00ad\nlinergic crisis. \nIndirect ways of increasing acetylcholine release have been uti\u00ad\nlized in conditions such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. \nAmifampridine and 4-aminopyridine (farnpridine and dalfarn\u00ad\npridine) are potassium channel antagonists that block the efflux. \nof potassium in nerve terminals, resulting in prolonged action \npotentials and increasing the release of acetylcholine at the neuro\u00ad\nmuscular junction. \nE. Toxicity \nIn addition to their therapeutic uses, some AChE inhibitors \n(especially organophosphates) have clinical importance because \nof accidental exposures to toxic amounts of pesticides. The use of \nextremely potent drugs in this class are of importance because of \npotential use in terrorist and other criminal attacks. The most toxic \nof these drugs (eg, parathion) can be rapidly fatal if exposure is \nnot immediately recognized and treated. After standard protec\u00ad\ntion of vital signs (see Chapter 58), the antidote of first choice \nis the antimuscarinic agent atropine, but this drug has no effect \non the nicotinic signs of toxicity. Nicotinic toxicity is treated by \nrespiratory support as needed and by regenerating active cholines\u00ad\nterase. Immediately after binding to cholinesterase, most organo\u00ad\nphosphate inhibitors can be removed from the enzyme by the use \nof regenerator compounds such as pralidoxime (see Chapter 8), \nand this may reverse both nicotinic and muscarinic signs. If the \nenzyme-phosphate binding is allowed to persist, aging (a further \nchemical change) occurs and regenerator drugs can no longer \nremove the inhibitor. Treatment is described in more detail in \nChapter 8. \nBecause of their toxicity and shon persistence in the envi\u00ad\nronment, organophosphates are used extensively in agriculture \nas insecticides; examples are malathion and parathion. Some \nof these agents (cg, malathion, dichlorvos) are relatively safe in \nhumans because they are metabolized rapidly to inactive products \nin mammals {and birds) but not in insects. Some are prodrugs \n(cg, malathion, parathion) and must be metabolized to the active \nproduct (malaoxon from malathion, paraoxon from parathion). \nA few are used in medicine as anthelminthic agents. The signs \nand symptoms of poisoning are the same as those described for \nthe direct-acting agents, with the following exceptions: vasodila\u00ad\ntion is a late and uncommon effect; bradycardia is more common \nthan tachycardia; CNS stimulation is common with organophos\u00ad\nphate and physostigmine overdosage and includes convulsions, \nfollowed by respiratory and cardiovascular depression. The spec\u00ad\ntrum of toxicity can be remembered with the aid of the mnemonic \nDUMBBELSS (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bronchoconstriction, \nbradycardia, excitation [of skeletal muscle and CNS], lacrimation, \nand salivation and sweating). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Drugs used \nfor their effects on the CNS or the eye must be sufficiently lipid \nsoluble to cross lipid barriers.

These agents do not replace the effects of levodopa (see \nChapter 28), but are used as effective adjuncts. \n2. Eye-Antimuscarinic drugs are used to cause mydriasis, as \nindicated by the origin of the name belladonna (\"beautiful lady\") \nfrom the ancient cosmetic use of extracts of the Atropa beliaJonna \nplant to dilate the pupils. They also cause cycloplegia and prevent \naccommodation. In descending order of duration of action, these \ndrugs are atropine (>72 h), homatropine (24 h), cydopentolatc \n(2-12 h), and tropicamide (0.5-4 h). These agents are all well \nabsorbed from the conjunctival sac into the eye. \n3. Bronchi-Parenteral atropine has long been used to reduce \nairway secretions during general anesthesia. lpratropium is a qua\u00ad\nternary antimuscarinic agent used by inhalation to promote bron\u00ad\nchodilation in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD). Although not as efficacious asp agonists, ipratropium is \nless likely to cause tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias in sensitive \npatients. It has very few antimuscarinic effects outside the lungs \nsince it is poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized. Tiotropium \nis an analog with a longer duration of action. Adidinium and \numcdidinium are newer long-acting antimuscarinic drugs avail\u00ad\nable in combination with long-acting ~radrenoceptor agonists for \nthe inhalation treatment of COPD. \n4. Gut-Atropine, methscopolamine, and propantbeline were \nused in the past to reduce acid secretion in acid-peptic disease, \nbut are now obsolete for this indication because they are not as \neffective as H2 blockers (see Chapter 16) and proton pump inhibi\u00ad\ntors (see Chapter 59), and they cause far more frequent and severe \nadverse effects. The M1-selective inhibitor pirenzepine is available \nin Europe for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Muscarinic blockers \ncan also be used to reduce cramping and hypermotility in tran\u00ad\nsient diarrheas, but drugs such as diphenoxylate and loperamide \n(see Chapters 31 and 59) are more effective. \n5. Bladder-Oxybutynin, tolt.erodine, or similar agents may be \nused to reduce urgency in mild cystitis and to reduce bladder spasms \nafter urologic surgery. Tolterodine, darifmacin, solifenacin, fes\u00ad\noterodine, and propiverine are slightly sdective for M3 receptors \nand are promoted for the treatment of stress incontinence. \nti. Cholinesterase inhibitor intoxication-Atropine, given \nparenterally in large doses, reduces the muscarinic signs of poi\u00ad\nsoning with AChE inhibitors. Pralidoxime (see bdow) is used to \nregenerate active AChE. \nE. Toxicity \nA traditional mnemonic for atropine toxicity is \"Dry as a bone, \nhot as a pistol, red as a beet, mad as a hatter.\" This description \nreflects both predictable antimuscarinic effects and some unpre\u00ad\ndictable actions. J. Predictable foxicifies-Antimuscarinic actions lead to sev\u00ad\neral important and potentially dangerous effects. Blockade of \nthermoregulatory sweating may result in hyperthermia or atro\u00ad\npine fever (\"hot as a pistol\"). This is the most dangerous effect of \nthe antimuscarinic drugs in children and is potentially lethal in \ninfants. Sweating, salivation, and lacrimation arc all significantly \nreduced or stopped (\"dry as a bone\"). Moderate tachycardia is \ncommon, and severe tachycardia or arrhythmias are common with \nlarge overdoses. In the dderly, important toxicities include acute \nangle-closure glaucoma and urinary retention, especially in men \nwith prostatic hyperplasia. Constipation and blurred vision are \ncommon adverse effects in all age groups. \n2. Other toxicities-Toxicities not predictable from peripheral \nautonomic actions include CNS and cardiovascular effects. CNS \ntoxicity includes sedation, amnesia, and delirium or hallucina\u00ad\ntions (\"mad as a hatter\"); convulsions may also occur. Central \nmuscarinic receptors are probably involved. Other drug groups \nwith antimuscarinic effects, for example, tricyclic antidepressants, \nmay cause hallucinations or ddirium in the elderly, who are espe\u00ad\ncially susceptible to antimuscarinic toxicity. At very high doses, \ncardiac intraventricular conduction may be blocked; this action \nis probably not mediated by muscarinic blockade and is difficult \nto treat. Dilation of the cutaneous vessels of the arms, head, neck, \nand trunk also occurs at these doses; the resulting \"atropine flush\" \n(\"red as a beet\") may be diagnostic of overdose with these drugs. \nThe mechanism is unknown. \n3. Treatment of toxicity-Treatment of toxicity is usually \nsymptomatic. Severe tachycardia may require cautious administra\u00ad\ntion of small doses of physostigmine. Hypcrthcrmia can usually be \nmanaged with cooling blankets or evaporative cooling. \nF. Contraindications \nThe antimuscarinic agents should be used cautiously in infants \nbecause of the danger of hyperthermia. The drugs are relativdy \ncontraindicated in persons with glaucoma, especially the closed\u00ad\nanglc form, in men with prostatic hyperplasia, and in erectile \ndysfunction since acetylcholine plays a role in smooth muscle \nrelaxation in genital erectile tissue. \nNICOTINIC ANTAGONISTS \nA. Ganglion-Blocking Drugs \nBlockers of ganglionic nicotinic receptors act like competitive \npharmacologic antagonists, although there is evidence that some \nalso block the pore of the nicotinic channd itsdf. These drugs \nwere the first successful agents for the treatment of hypertension \nbut are now obsolete for this indication. Heu.methonium (C6, a \nprototype), mecamylamine, and several other ganglion blockers \nwere cxtensivdy used for this disease. Unfortunatdy, the adverse \neffects of ganglion blockade in hypertension are so severe (both \nsympathetic and parasympathetic divisions are blocked) that"

It has poor \nlipid solubility, is inactive orally, and has a short half-life. It was \nused intravenously to treat severe accelerated hypertension (malig\u00ad\nnant hypertension} and to produce controlled hypotension. These \ndrugs are still used in research. \nRecent interest has focused on nicotinic receptors in the \nCNS and their relation to nicotine addiction and to Tourette \nsyndrome. Paradoxically, nicotine (in the form of nicotine gum \nor patches}, varenicl.ine (a partial agonist given by mouth), \nand mecamylamine, a nicotinic ganglion blocker that enters \nthe CNS, have all been shown to have some benefit in smoking \ncessation. \nBecause ganglion blockers interrupt sympathetic control of \nvenous tone, they cause marked venous pooling; postural hypo\u00ad\ntension is a major manifestation of this effect. Other toxicities of \nganglion-blocking drugs include dry mouth, blurred vision, con\u00ad\nstipation, and severe sexual dysfunction (Table 8-2). As a result, \nganglion blockers are rarely used in clinical practice. \nB. Neuromuscular-Blocklng Drugs \nNeuromuscular-blocking drugs are useful for producing marked \nskeletal muscle relaxation that is important in surgery and in \nmechanical ventilation of patients. They are discussed in detail in \nChapter27. CHOLINESTERASE REGENERATORS \nPralidmime is the prototype cholinesterase regenerator. These \nchemical antagonists contain an oxime group, which has an \nextremely high affinity for the phosphorus atom in organophosphate \ninsecticides. Because the affinity of the oxime group for phosphorus \nexceeds the affinity of the enzyme active site for phosphorus, these \nagents are able to bind the inhibitor and displace the inhibitor from \nthe enzyme if\"aging\" (inhibitor has made a covalent bond with the \nenzyme) has not occurred. The active enzyme is thus regenerated. \nPralidoxime, the oxime currently available in the United States, is \nused to treat patients exposed to high doses of organophosphate \nAChE inhibitor insecticides, such as parathion, or to nerve gases. It is \nnot recommended for use in carbamate AChE inhibitor overdosage. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

Tachycardia is a characteristic atropine overdose effect. Bra\u00ad\ndycardia is sometimes observed after small doses. None of the \nother choices are typical of atropine or methamphetamine \noverdose. The answer is B. \n2. Choices B, D, and E are all possible effects of the atropine \ngroup. In infants, however, the most dangerous effect is \nhyperthermia. Deaths with body temperatures in excess of \n42 \u00b7c have occurred after the use of atropine-containing eye \ndrops in children. The answer is D. \n3. Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors and inhibits parasym\u00ad\npathomimetic effects. Nicotine can induce both parasym\u00ad\npathomimetic and sympathomimetic effects by virtue of its \nganglion-stimulating action. Hypertension and exercise\u00ad\ninduced tachycardia reflect sympathetic discharge with nor\u00ad\nepinephrine rdease and therefore would not be blocked by \natropine. Exercise--induced sweating is another sympathomi\u00ad\nmetic response, but it is mediated by acetylcholine rdeased \nfrom sympathetic nerve fibers at eccrine sweat glands. The \nanswer is E. \n4. Drug X causes an increase in blood pressure that is blocked \nby a ganglion blocker but not by a muscarinic blocker. The \npresser response is actually increased by pretreatment with \natropine, a muscarinic blocker, suggesting that compensatory \nvagal discharge might have blunted the full response. This \ndescription fits a ganglion stimulant like nicotine but not epi\u00ad\nnephrine, since epinephrine's presser effects are produced at \na receptors, not in the ganglia. The answer is E. \n5. Drug Y causes an increase in heart rate that is blocked by a \nmuscarinic blocker but reversed by a ganglion blocker. The \nfact that a ganglion blocker reverses the unknown drug's effect \nsuggests that the control response (t.achycardia) involves the \nbaroreceptor reflex. The description fits a direct-acting mus\u00ad\ncarinic stimulant such as acetylcholine (given in a dosage \nthat causes a significant drop in blood pressure). An indirect\u00ad\nacting cholinomimetic {cholinesterase inhibitor, B) would not \nproduce this pattern because the vascular muscarinic recep\u00ad\ntors involved in the depressor response are not innervated and \nare unresponsive to indirectly acting agents. The answer is A. \n6. Neither gangllon blockers nor muscarinic blockers cause mio~ \nsis; they cause mydriasis. Both classes of cholinoceptor block\u00ad\ners increase resting hean rate and cause cycloplegia, because \nthese are determined largely by parasympathetic tone. Simi\u00ad\nlarly, both can cause dry skin, since this requires cholinergic \ntransmission. Postural hypotension, on the other hand, is a \nsign of sympathetic blockade, which would occur with gan~ \nglion blockers but not muscarinic blockers (see Chapter 6). \nThe answer is D."

Bronchospasm is mediated in part by vagal ou~ \nflow in many patients with COPD and in some with asthma. \nThe answer is C. \n8.

            "Text": "78 PART II Autonomic Drugs \naction. Cocaine and certain antidepre11ants exhibit another form \nof indirect action; these drugs inhibit reuptake of catecholamines \nby the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine trans\u00ad\nporter (DAT) in nerve terminals (see Figure 6-2) and thus increase \nthe synaptic activity of released transmitter. The complex actions \nof antidepressants on amine reuptake are discussed in Chapter 30. \nBlockade of metabolism (ie, block of catechol-0-methyltrans\u00ad\nferase [COMT] and monoamine oxidase [MAO]) has little direct \neffect on autonomic activity, but MAO inhibition increases the \nstores of catecholamines and related molecules in adrenergic syn\u00ad\naptic vesicles and thus may potentiate the action of indirect-acting \nsympathomimetics (cg, amphetamines) that cause the release of \nstored transmitter. COMT inhibitors are useful in parkinsonism \n(see Chapter 28). \nCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOKINETICS \nThe endogenous adrenoceptor agonists (epinephrine, norepi\u00ad\nnephrine, and dopamine) are catecholamines and are rapidly \nmetabolized by COMT and MAO as described in Chapter 6. If \nused as drugs, these adrenoceptor agonists are relatively inactive by \nthe oral route and must be given parenterally. When released from \nnerve endings, they are subsequently taken up (by NET or DAT) \ninto nerve endings and into perisynaptic cells; this uptake may also \noccur with exogenous norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine \ngiven as drugs. These agonists have a short duration of action. \nWhen given parenterally, they do not enter the central nervous \nsystem (CNS) in significant amounts. Isoproterenol, a synthetic \ncatecholamine, is similar to the endogenous transmitters hut is not \nreadily taken up into nerve endings. Phenylisopropylamines, for \nexample, amphetamines, are resistant to MAO; most of them are \nnot catecholamines and are therefore also resistant to COMT. Phe\u00ad\nnylisopropylamines are orally active; they enter the CNS, and their \neffects last much longer than do those of catecholamines. Tyra\u00ad\nmine, which is not a phenylisopropylamine, is rapidly metabolized \nby MAO (and is inactive orally) except in patients who are taking \nan MAO inhibitor drug. MAO inhibitors are sometimes used in \nthe treatment of depression (see Chapter 30). Because tyramine is \nfound in fermented foods, patients taking MAO inhibitors may \nhave hypenensive reactions to such foods. \nMECHANISMS OF ACTION \nA. Alpha-Receptor Effects \nAlpha-receptor effects are mediated primarily by the trimeric cou\u00ad\npling protein Gq. When Gq is activated, the a moiety of this protein \nactivates the enzyme phospholipase C, resulting in the release of \ninositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP~ and diacylglycerol (DAG) from \nmembrane lipids. IP 3 acts on intracellular IP 3 receptors to cause \ncalcium release from stores in smooth muscle cells. Direct gating \nof membrane calcium channels may also play a role in increasing \nintracellular calcium concentration. Intracellular enzymes are acti\u00ad\nvated by DAG. Alpha2-receptor activation results in inhibition of \nadenylyl cyclase via the coupling protein Gi. B. Beta-Receptor Effects \nAll J3 receptors (p1, j32, and J3J stimulate adenylyl cyclase via the \ncoupling protein G,, which leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine \nmonophosphate (cAMP} concentration in the cell. Some evidence \nsuggests that J3 receptors may exert G-protein-independent effects \nafter binding j3-arrestin. As noted in Chapter 2, biased agonists \nappear to have effects in addition to traditional G,-activating \nactions; J3-arrestin may mediate these actions. \nC. Dopamine-Receptor Effects \nDopamine D1 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase via G, and increase \ncAMP in neurons and vascular smooth muscle; dilation of vessels \nresults. Dopamine D2 receptors are more important in the brain but \nprobably also play a significant role as presynaptic receptors on periph\u00ad\neral nerves. These receptors reduce the synthesis of cAMP via G;. \nORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS \nA. Central Nervous System \nCatecholamines do not enter the CNS readily. Sympathomimet\u00ad\nics that do enter the CNS (eg, amphetamines, cocaine) have a \nspectrum of stimulant effects, beginning with mild alerting or \nreduction of fatigue and progressing to anorexia, euphoria, and \ninsomnia. These CNS effects reflect both a noradrenergic effect \nand the amplification of dopamine' s action in the ventral tegmen\u00ad\ntal area and other CNS nuclei (see Chapter 32). Repeated dosing \nof amphetamines results in the rapid development of tolerance and \ndependence. Very high doses of amphetamines lead to marked \nanxiety or aggressiveness, paranoia. and, less commonly, seizures. \nOverdoses of cocaine very commonly result in seizures. \nSome az-selective agonists (cg, donidine) cause vasoconstric\u00ad\ntion when administered intravenously or locally into the conjunc\u00ad\ntival sac. However, when given chronically, they are readily taken \nup into the CNS and reduce sympathetic outflow, probably by \nactivating <Xz adrenoceptors on presynaptic nerve endings. As a \nresult, they can lower blood pressure (see also Chapter 11). \na.Eye \nThe smooth muscle of the pupillary dilator responds to topi\u00ad\ncal phenylephrine and similar ex agonists with contraction and \nmydriasis. Accommodation is not significantly affected. Outflow \nof aqueous humor may be facilitated by nonselective a agonists, \nwith a subsequent reduction of intraocular pressure. This prob\u00ad\nably occurs via the uveoscleral drainage system. Alpharselective \nagonists also reduce intraocular pressure, apparently by reducing \nsynthesis of aqueous humor. \nC. Bronchi \nThe smooth muscle of the bronchi relaxes markedly in response to J3i \nagonists, for example, isoproterenol and albuterol. Beta2 agonists are \nthe most efficacious and reliable drugs fur reversing hronchospasm. \nD. Gastrolntestinal Tract \nThe gastrointestinal tract is well endowed with both ex and J3 \nreceptors, located both on smooth muscle and on neurons of \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "the enteric nervous system. Activation of either a or P receptors \nleads to relaxation of the smooth muscle. Alpha2 agonises may also \ndecrease salt and water secretion into the intestine. \nE. Genitourinary Tract \nThe genitourinary tract contains a receptors in the bladder tri\u00ad\ngone and sphincter area; these receptors mediate contraction of the \nsphincter. In men, a, receptors mediate prostatic smooth muscle \ncontraction. Sympathomimetics are sometimes used to increase \nsphincter tone. Beta2 agonises may cause significant uterine relax\u00ad\nation in pregnant women near term, but the doses required also \ncause significant tachycardia. \nF. Vascular System \nDifferent vascular beds respond differently, depending on their \ndominant receptor type (Tables 9-1and9-2). \n7. Alpha, agonists-Alpha 1 agonises (eg, phcnylephrine) \ncontract vascular smooth muscle, especially in skin and splanch\u00ad\nnic blood vessels, and increase peripheral vascular resistance and \nvenous pressure. Because these drugs increase blood pressure, they \noften evoke a compensatory reflex bradycardia that is mediated by \nthe vagus (see Figure 6--4). \n2.Alpha 2agonists-Alpha 1 agonises (cg, clonidine) cause vaso\u00ad\nconstriction when administered intravenously or topically (eg, as \na nasal spray), but when given orally they accumulate in the CNS \nand reduce sympathetic outflow and blood pressure as described \nin Chapter 11. \n3. Beta agonists-Beta2 agonises (eg, albuterol, metaproter\u00ad\nenol, terbutaline) and nonselective P agonises (eg, isoproter\u00ad\nenol) cause significant reduction in arteriolar tone in the skeletal \nmuscle vascular bed and can reduce peripheral vascular resistance \nand arterial blood pressure. Beta1 agonises (eg, dobutamine) have \nrelatively less effect on vessels but are potent cardiac stimulants. \n4. Dopamine-Dopamine causes vasodilation in the splanch\u00ad\nnic and renal vascular beds by activating 01 receptors. This effect \ncan be useful in the treatment of renal failure associated with \nshock. At higher doses, dopamine activates P receptors in the CHAPTER 9 Sympathomimetics 79 \nheart and elsewhere; at still higher doses, a receptors are also \nactivated. \nG.Heart \nThe heart is well supplied with p, and p2 receptors. The p1 recep\u00ad\ntors predominate in some parts of the heart; both Pi and Pi recep\u00ad\ntors mediate increased rate of cardiac pacemakers {normal and \nabnormal), increased atrioventricular node conduction velocity, \nand increased cardiac force. \nH. Net Cardiovascular Actions \nSympathomimetics with both a and p1 effects (eg, norepineph\u00ad\nrine) may cause a reflex increase in vagal outflow because they \nincrease blood pressure and evoke the baroreccptor reflex. This \nreflex vagal effect may dominate any direct P effects on the heart \nrate, so that a slow infusion of norepinephrine typically causes \nincreased blood pressure and bradycardia (Figure 9-1; Table 9-2). \nIf the reflex is blocked { eg, by a ganglion blocker or antimuscarinic \ndrug), norepincphrine will cause a direct P1-mediated tachycardia. \nA pure a agonist (eg, phenylephrine) routinely slows heart rate via \nthe baroreceptor reflex, whereas a pure P agonise (eg, isoproter\u00ad\nenol) almost always increases heart rate. \nDiastolic blood pressure is affected mainly by peripheral vas\u00ad\ncular resistance and the heart rate. (The heart rate is important \nbecause the diastolic interval determines the duration of outflow \nof blood from the arterial compartment.) The adrenoceptors with \nthe greatest effects on vascular resistance are a and p2 receptors. \nThe pulse pressure (the systolic minus the diastolic pressure) is \ndetermined mainly by the stroke volume (a function of force of \ncardiac contraction), which is influenced by P1 receptors. The sys\u00ad\ntolic pressure is the sum of the diastolic and the pulse pressures and \nis therefore a function of both a and P effects. \nI. Metabolic and Hormonal Effects \nBeta1 agonises increase renin secretion. Beta2 agonises increase \ninsulin secretion. They also increase glycogenolysis in the liver and \nthe resulting hyperglycemia is countered by the increased insulin \nlevels. Transport of glucose out of the liver is associated initially \nwith hypcrkalcmia; transport into peripheral organs (especially \nskeletal muscle) is accompanied by movement of potassium into \nthese cells, resulting in a later hypokalemia. All currently available \nJ3 agonises appear to stimulate lipolysis via the P3 receptor. \nTABLE 9-2 Effects of prototypical sympathomimetics on vascular resistance, blood pressure, and heart rate. \nDrug \nPhenylephrine \nlsoproterenol \nNorepinephrine Skin.

Predict the probable compensatory responses \nto a chronic increase in blood pressure caused by a tumor \nreleasing large amounts of norepinephrine. The Skill Keeper \nAnswer appears at the end of the chapter. \nCLINICAL USES \nPharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical applications of sdected \nsympathomimetics are shown in the Drug Summary Table. \nA. Anaphylaxis \nEpinephrine is the drug of choice fur the immediate treatment \nof anaphylactic shock (hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema) \nbecause it is an effective physiologic antagonist of many of the \nmediators of anaphylaxis. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may \nalso be used, but these agents are neither as efficacious as epi\u00ad\nnephrine nor as rapid acting. The critical need fur epinephrine \nin a readily injectable form for anaphylaxis has called attention to \nrecent price gouging fur the standard product. \nB. Central Nervous System \nThe phenylisopropylamines such as amphetamine are widdy \nused and abused fur their CNS effects. Legitimate indications \ninclude narcolepsy and, with appropriate adjunct therapy, weight reduction. The anorexiant effect may be hdpful in initiating \nweight loss but is insufficient to maintain the loss unless patients \nalso receive intensive dietary and psychological counsding and \nsupport. Methylpbenidatc and other amphetamine analogs are \nheavily used in attention deficit hyperactiviry disorder (ADHD). \nThe drugs are abused or misused fur the purpose of deferring sleep \nand for their mood-elevating, euphoria-producing action. Cocaine \nis abused fur its mood-elevating effect. These drugs have a high \naddiction liability (see Chapter 32). \nC.Eye \nThe a agonists, especially phenylephrine and tetrabydrowline, \nare often used to reduce the conjunctival itching and congestion \ncaused by irritation or allergy. Phenylephrine is also an effective \nmydriatic. These drugs do not cause cycloplegia. Newer CX:z ago\u00ad\nnists are in current use fur glaucoma and include apradonidine \nand brimonidine. As noted, the exi-sdective agonists appear to \nreduce synthesis of aqueous humor. See Table 10-2 for a summary \nof drugs used in glaucoma. \nD. Bronchi \nThe p agonists, especially the Pi-selective agonises, are drugs of \nchoice in the treatment of acute asthmatic bronchoconstriction. \nThe short-acting Pi-selective agonists (eg, albuterol, metapro\u00ad\nterenol, terbutaline) are not recommended fur prophylaxis , but \nthey are safe and effective and may be lifesaving in the treatment \nof acute bronchospasm. Much longer-acting Pz-sdective agonists, \nsalmeterol, formot.erol, inclacaterol, olodaterol, and vilanterol \nare used in combination with corticosteroids or antimuscarinic \nagents for prophylaxis in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD); they are not indicated fur the treatment of acute \nsymptoms (see Chapter 20). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Conditions in which an inaeaH in blood Row ls \nneeded-In acute heart failure and some types of shock, an \nincrease in cardiac output and blood flow to the tissues is needed. \nBeta1 agonists may be useful in this situation because they increase \ncardiac contractility and reduce {to some degree) afterload by \ndecreasing the impedance to ventricular e;ection through a small ~2 \neffect. Norepinephrine, in contrast to earlier recommendations, is \nan effective agent in septic and cardiogenic shock when used prop\u00ad\nerly. Dobutamine and dopamine are also used. Unfortunately, \nthe arrhyth.mogenic effects of these drugs may be dose-limiting . \n2. Conditions In which a decrease in blood now or Increase \nIn blood pressure Is needed-Alpha1 agonists are useful in \nsituations in which vasoconstriction is appropriate. These include \nlocal hcmostatic (epinephrine) and decongestant effects (pbcnyl\u00ad\nephrine) as well as shock (norepinephrine, phenylephrine), in \nwhich temporary maintenance of blood pressure may help main\u00ad\ntain perfusion of the brain, heart, and kidneys. High doses of vaso\u00ad\nconstrictors may worsen shock due to septicemia or myocardial \ninfarction because cardiac reserve is marginal. In the administra\u00ad\ntion of local anesthesia, a agonists are often mixed with the local \nanesthetic to reduce the loss of anesthetic from the area of injec\u00ad\ntion into the circulation. Chronic orthostatic hypotension due to \ninadequate sympathetic tone can be treated with oral ephedrine or \na newer orally active a1 agonist, midodrine. \n3. Conditions In which acute cardiac stimulation Is \nneeded-Epinephrine has been used in cardiac arrest by intra\u00ad\nvenous and direct intracardiac injection. lsoprotetcnol has been \nused for atriovcntricular (AV) block. \nF. Genitourinary Trad \nBeta2 agonists (ritodrine, tttbutalinc) are sometimes used to \nsuppress premature labor, but the cardiac stimulant effect with \narrhythmias may be hazardous to both mother and fews. Non\u00ad\nstcroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, and \nmagnesium arc also used for this indication. \nLong-acting oral sympathomimctics such as ephedrine are \nsometimes used to improve urinary continence in the dderly and \nin children with enuresis. This action is mediated by a receptors \nin the trigonc of the bladder and, in men, the smooth muscle of \nthe prostate. \nTOXICITY \nBecause of their limited penetration into the brain, catechol\u00ad\namines have little CNS toxicity when given systemically . In \nthe periphery , their adverse effects arc extensions of their phar\u00ad\nmacologic a or ~ actions: excessive vasoconstriction , cardiac CHAPTER 9 Syrnpathomimetics 81 \narrhythmias, myocardial infarction , hemorrhagic stroke, and pul\u00ad\nmonary edema or hemorrhage . \nThe pheoylisopropylamina may produce mild to severe \nCNS toxicity, depending on dosage. In moderate doses, they may \ninduce nervousness, anorexia, and insomnia ; in higher doses, they \nmay cause anxiety, aggressiveness, or paranoid behavior. Convul\u00ad\nsions may occur. Peripherally acting agents have toxicities that are \npredictable on the basis of the receptors they activate. Thus, a1 \nagonists cause hypertension, and ~1 agonists cause sinus tachycar~ \ndia and serious arrhythmias. Beta2 agonists cause skeletal muscle \ntremor. It is important to note that none of these drugs is perfectly \nselective; at high doses, ~1-sclcctivc agents have l3z actions and vice \nversa.

            "Text": "4. \"Herbal\" medications often contain potent synthetic drugs in \naddition to (or instead of) the advertised constituents . This \npatient shows signs of sympathetic autonomic failure: hypo\u00ad\ntension, inappropriate bradycardia, constricted pupils. These \nsigns arc compatible with a large overdose of a drug that causes \nmarked depletion of stored catecholamine transmitter such as \nreserpine, an obsolete but inexpensive antihypertensive agent. \nThe indirect-acting agents (amphetamines and tyramine) act \nthrough catecholamines in (or rdeased from) the nerve termi\u00ad\nnal and would therefore he ineffective in this patient. Cioni\u00ad\ndine acts primarily on presynaptic nerve endings although \nit can activate <X:z receptors located elsewhere. Isoproterenol \nwould stimulate the heart but has no a-agonist action and \nmight exacerbate the hypotension. Norepinephrine has the \nnecessary combination of direct action and a spectrum that \nincludes <X1, <X2, and P1 effects. The answer is D. \n5. The dual blood pressure effects of the drug suggest that ini\u00ad\ntially it is causing a direct a-agonise vasoconstrictor effect, but \nwhen given for a week, it is accumulating in a blood pressure\u00ad\ncontrolling center, for example, the CNS, and reducing sym\u00ad\npathetic outflow via <X:z effects. The answer is B. \n6. Tremor is a common ~ effect. Blood vessels in the skin have \nalmost exclusively a (vasoconstrictor) receptors. Stimulation \nof renin release is a p1 effect. Beta2 agonists cause hyperglycemi4 \nand have little effect on cGMP. The answer is D. \n7. Heart transplantation involves cutting of the autonomic \nnerves to the heart. As a result, autonomic nerve endings \ndegenerate, and cardiac transmitter stores are absent for \n2 years or longer after surgery. Therefore, indirect-acting \nsympathomimetics arc ineffective in changing heart rate. All \nthe drugs listed arc direct-acting, and all but phenylephrine \nhave significant effects on P receptors. Phenylephrine usually \ncauses reflex bradycardia, which requires intact vagal innerva\u00ad\ntion. The answer is E. (Note that denervation may result in \nuprcgulation of both Pi and~ receptors so that direct-acting P agonists may have a greater than normal effect.) \n8. The drug X dose caused a decrease in diastolic blood pressure \nand little change in systolic pressure. Thus, there was a large \ninCl'CaSC in pulse pressure. The decrease in diastolic pressure sug\u00ad\ngests that the drug decreased vascular resistance, that is, it must \nhave significant muscarinic or p-agonist effects. The fact that it \nalso markedly increased pulse pressure suggests that it strongly \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: CHAPTER 9 Syrnpathomimetics 83 \nincreased stroke volume, a P-agonist effect. The drug with these P effects is isoprotercnol (Figure 9-1). The answer is C. \n9. Drug Y caused a marked increase in diastolic pressure, sug\u00ad\ngesting strong a-vasoconstrictor effects. It caused little or \nno increase in pulse pressure, suggesting negligible fi-agonist \naction. (An increase in stroke volume may result from increased \nvenous return, an a-agonise effect.) The drug that best matches \nthis description is phenylephrine. The answer is E. \n10. The investigational agent caused a marked increase in sys\u00ad\ntolic and diastolic pressures and a moderate increase in pulse \npressure (from 40 to 60 mm Hg). These changes suggest a \nstrong a effect on vessds and an increase in stroke volume, a \nfi-agonist action in the heart. A dominant a action might be \nexpected to cause a reflex bradycardia, but heart rate actually \nincreased significantly, reflecting a large P response. Note that \nthe stroke volume also increased (cardiac output divided by \nheart rate-from 70.2 to 81.7 mL), suggesting increased con~ \ntractility, another P response. The drug behaves most like a \nmixed a and P agonist, for example, epinephrine. The answer \nis B. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: BLOOD PRESSURE \nCONTROL MECHANISMS IN PHEOCHROMO\u00ad\nCYTOMA {SEE CHAPTER 6) \nBecause the control mechanisms that attempt to main-\ntain blood pressure constant are Intact In patients with \npheochromocytoma (fn patients with ordinary \"essential\" \nhypertension, they are reset to maintain the elevated pres\u00ad\nsure), a number of compensatory changes are observed in \npheochromocytoma patients (see Figure 6-4). These include \nreduced renin, angiotensin, and a/dosterone levels in the \nblood. Reduced aldosterone causes more salt and water to \nbe excreted by the /cidney, redudng blood volume. Since the \nred cell mass is not affected, hematocrlt fs often increased. \nff the tumor releases only norepinephrlne, a compensatory \nbradycardia may also be present, but most patients release \nenough epinephrine to maintain heart rate at a normal or \neven increased level. \n0 Name a typical a agonist; a selective <X:z agonist; a nonselective ~ agonist; a selective \n~, agonist selective P2 agonists; an a,, \u00ab21 p1 agonlst; and an a,, ~ p,, P:z agonist. \n0 List tissues that contain significant numbers of a1 or <X:z receptors. \nO List tissues that contain significant numbers of p, or P:z receptors. \n0 Describe the major organ system effects of a pure a agonist, a pure P agonist, and a \nmixed ex and p agonist. \n0 Describe a clinical situation in which the effects of an Indirect sympathomimetic would \ndiffer from those of a direct agonist.

This \ndifference may be important in the treatment of phcochromocy\u00ad\ntoma because a massive release of catecholamines from the tumor \nmay overcome a reversible blockade. \nD.Effects \nf. Nonselectlve blockers- These agents cause a predictable \nblockade of CX.-mediated responses to sympathetic nervous system \ndischarge and exogenous sympathomimetics (ie, the a responses \nlisted in Table 9-1). The most important effects of nonselective \na blockers are those on the cardiovascular system: a reduction in \nvascular tone with a reduction of both arterial and venous pres\u00ad\nsures. There are no significant direct cardiac effects. However, \nthe nonselective a blockers do cause baroreceptor reflex-mediated \ntachycardia as a result of the drop in mean arterial pressure (see \nFigure 6-4). This tachycardia may be exaggerated because the~ \nreceptors on adrenergic nerve terminals in the heart, which nor\u00ad\nmally reduce the net release of norepinephrine, are also blocked \n(see Figure 6-3). \nEpinephrine revenal (Figure 10-1) is a predictable effect in a \npatient who has received an a blocker. The term refers to a reversal \nof the blood pressure effect of large doses of epinephrine, from a \npressor response (mediated by a receptors) to a depressor response \n(mediated by~ receptors) . The effect is not observed with phen\u00ad\nylephrine or norepinephrine because these drugs lack sufficient ~2 \neffects. Epinephrine reversal, manifested as orthostati c hypoten\u00ad\nsion, is occasionally seen as an unexpected (but predictable) effect \nof drugs for which a blockade is an adverse effect (eg, some phe\u00ad\nnothiazine antipsychotic agents, some antihistamines). \n2. Selective a blockers-Because prazosin and its analogs \nblock vascular a1 receptors much more effectively than the <Xrmodulatory receptors associated with cardiac sympathetic \nnerve endings, these drugs reduce blood pressure with much less \nreflex tachycardia than the nonselective a blockers. These drugs \nalso have useful relaxing effects on smooth muscle in the prostate. \nE. Clinical Uses \n1. Nonselective a blockers-Nonselective a blockers have \nlimited clinical applications. The best-documented application \nis in the presurgical management of pheochromocytoma. Such \npatients may have severe hypertension and reduced blood vol\u00ad\nume, which should be corrected before subjecting the patient to \nthe stress of surgery. Phenoxybenzamine is usually used during \nthis preparatory phase; phentolamine is sometimes used during \nsurgery. Phenoxybenzamine also has serotonin receptor-blocking \neffects, which justify its occasional use in carcinoid tumor, as wdl \nas H 1 antihistaminic effects, which lead to its use in mastocytosis. \nAccidental local infiltration of potent a agonises such as nor\u00ad\nepinephrine may lead to severe tissue ischemia and necrosis if not \npromptly reversed; infiltration of the ischemic area with phentol\u00ad\namine is sometimes used to prevent tissue damage. Overdose with \ndrugs of abuse such as amphetamine, cocaine, or phenylpropanol\u00ad\namine may lead to severe hypertension because of their indirect \nsympathomimetic actions. This hypertension usually responds \nwell to a blockers. Sudden cessation of clonidine therapy leads to \nrebound hypertension (see Chapter 11); chis phenomenon is often \ntreated with phentolamine. \nRaynaud phenomenon sometimes responds to a blockers, but \ntheir efficacy in this condition is not well documented . Phencol\u00ad\namine or yohimbine has been used by direct injection to cause \npenile erection in men with erectile dysfunction, but oral phospho\u00ad\ndiesterase inhibitors are more commonly used (see Chapter 12). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The epinephrine response exhibits reversal of the mean blood pressure change from a net increase (the a response) to a net decrease \n(the p2 response). The response to phenylephrine is suppressed but not reversed, because phenylephrine lacks p action. \n2. Selective a blockers-Prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin are \nused in hypertension (see Chapter 11). These a1 blockers, as well \nas tamsulosin and silodosin are also used to reduce urinary hesi\u00ad\ntancy and prevent urinary retention in men with benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (BPH). \nF. Toxicity \nThe most important toxicities of the a blockers are simple exten\u00ad\nsions of their a-blocking effects. The main manifestations are \northostatic hypotension and, in the case of the nonselective agents, \nmarked reflex tachycardia. Tachycardia is less common and less \nsevere with a.-selectivc blockers. Phcntolaminc also has some \nnon-alpha-mediated vasodilating effects. In patients with coro\u00ad\nnary disease, angina may be precipitated by the tachycardia. Oral \nadministration of some of these drugs can cause nausea and vom\u00ad\niting. The a1-selective agents are associated with an exaggerated \northostatic hypotensivc response to the first dose in some patients. \nTherefore, the first dose is usually small and taken just before \ngoing to bed. \nBETA-BLOCKING DRUGS \nA. Classification, Subgroups, and Mechanisms \nAll of the P blockers used clinically are competitive pharmacologic \nantagonists. Propranolol is the prototype. Drugs in this group \narc usually classified into subgroups on the basis of ~1 selectivity, \npartial agonist activity, local anesthetic action, and lipid solubility \n(Table 10-1). Metoprolol and betaxolol appear to have inverse \nagonise action. 1. Receptor se/ectiviey-Beta1-reccptor selectivity (~1 block> \np2 block) is a property of acebutolol, atenolol, esmolol, meto\u00ad\nprolol, and several other ~ blockers. This property may be an \nadvantage when treating patients with asthma because functioning \np2 receptors are important in preventing bronchospasm in such \npatients. Nadolol, propranolol, and timolol are typical nonselec\u00ad\ntivc p blockers. Note that, except for ~ blockers that start with the \nletter \"c,\" blockers with names starting with letters \"a\" through \n\"m\" are _fi1 selective. \nLabetalol and carvedilol have combined a-and ~-blocking \nactions. These drugs are optically active, and different isomers \nhave a-or fl-blocking action. Nebivolol has vasodilating action in \naddition to dose-dependent ~1-selective antagonism. \n2. Partial agonist activity-Partial agonist activity (\"intrinsic \nsympathomimetic activity\") may be an advantage in treating patients \nwith asthma because these drugs (eg, pin.dolol, acebutolol)-at \nleast in theory-are less likely to cause bronchospasm. In contrast, \nfull antagonists such as propranolol are more likely to cause severe \nbronchospasm in patients with airway disease. \n3. Local anesthetic activity-Local anesthetic acttVJty \n(\"membrane-stabilizing activity\") is a disadvantage when P block\u00ad\ners are used topically in the eye because it decreases protective \nreflexes and increases the risk of corneal ulceration. Local anes\u00ad\nthetic effects are absent from timolol and several other ~ blockers \nthat arc useful in glaucoma. \n4.

On the same graph, draw the curves for \nthe percentage of receptors bound to albuterol and to pindo\u00ad\nlol at each concentration. The Skill Keeper Answer appears \nat the end of the chapter. \nB. Effects and Clinical Uses \nMost of the organ-levd effects of P blockers are predictable from \nblockade of the P-receptor-mediated effects of sympathetic dis\u00ad\ncharge. The clinical applications of P blockade are remarkably \nbroad (see the Drug Summary Table). The treatment of open\u00ad\nangle glaucoma involves the use of several groups of autonomic \ndrugs as well as other agents (Table 10-2). The cardiovascular \napplications of P blockers-especially in hypertension, angina, \nand arrhythmias-are extremely important. Treatment of chronic \n(not acute) heart failure has become an important application of \nP blockers. Several large clinical trials have shown that some, but not all, P blockers can reduce morbidity and mortality when used \nproperly in chronic heart failure (see Chapter 13). A similar para\u00ad\ndoxical benefit of P-blocker therapy has been observed in some \npatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \nLabetalol, carvedilol, and metoprolol have documented benefits \nin this application. Pheochromocytoma is sometimes treated with \ncombined a-and P-blocking agents (eg, labetalol), especially if \nthe tumor is producing large amounts of epinephrine as well as \nnorepinephrine. A central nervous system application in reduc\u00ad\ning tremor is described in Chapter 28. A novel and unexplained \nbeneficial reduction in the size of infantile hemangiomas has been \nreported for propranolol. \nC. Toxicity \nCardiovascular adverse effects, which arc extensions of the p block\u00ad\nade, include bradycardia, atrioventricular blockade, and heart \nfailure. Patients with asthmatic airway disease may suffer severe \nasthma attacks although some patients with COPD may benefit \nfrom careful use of Pi -selective agents. Beta blockers have been \nshown experimentally to reduce insulin secretion, but this does not \nappear to be a clinically important effect. However, premonitory \nsymptoms of hypoglycemia from insulin overdosage (tachycardia, \ntremor, and anxiety) may be masked by P blockers, and mobiliza\u00ad\ntion of glucose from the liver and sequestration of K' in skdetal \nmuscle may be impaired. CNS adverse effects include sedation, \nfatigue, and sleep alterations. Atenolol, nadolol, and several other \nless lipid-soluble P blockers are claimed to have less marked CNS \naction because they do not enter the CNS as readily as other mem\u00ad\nbers of this group. Sexual dysfunction has been reported for most \nof the P blockers in some patients. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Mydriasis caused by contraction of the pupillary dilator radial \nsmooth muscle is mediated by IX receptors. All the other \neffects listed are mediated by 13 receptors. The answer is C. \n2. Although chronic heart failure is often treated with certain 13 \nblockers, acute heart failure can be precipitated or made worse \nby any 13 blocker. Choices A, C, and E reverse the correct pair\u00ad\ning of receptor subtype (a. versus (3) with effect. Choice D \nreverses the direction of change of intraocular pressure. The \nanswer is B. \n3. In developing a strategy for this type of question, consider first \nthe actions of the known blocking drugs. Hexamethonium \nblocks reflexes as well as the direct action of nicotine. Atropine \nwould block direct muscarinic effects of an unknown drug (if \nit had any) or reflex slowing of the heart mediated by the \nvagus. Phenoxybenzamine blocks only a-receptor-mediated \nprocesses. If the response produced in the nonpretreated ani\u00ad\nmal is blocked or reversed by hexamethonium, it is probably \na direct nicotinic effect or a reflex response to hypotension. In \nthat case, consider all the receptors involved in mediating the \nreflex. Drug W causes tachycardia that is prevented by gan\u00ad\nglion blockade. The only drug in the list of choices that causes \nhypotension and tachycardia that is not blocked by atropine \nis isoproterenol, and the tachycardia caused by isoproterenol \nis not blocked by ganglionic blockade. Thus, drug W must be \nnicotine or a drug similar to it. The answer is D. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Drug X causes slowing of the heart rate, but this is converted \ninto tachycardia by hexarnethonium and atropine, demon\u00ad\nstrating that when it occurs, the bradycardia is caused by \nreflex vagal discharge. Phenoxybenzamine also reverses the \nbradycardia to tachycardia, suggesting that a. receptors are \nneeded to induce the reflex bradycardia and that X also has \ndirect P-agonist actions. The choices that evoke a vagal reflex \nbradycardia (vasoconstrictors) but can also cause direct tachy\u00ad\ncardia (p agonists) are limited; the answer is E. \nS. Drug Y causes tachycardia that is not significantly influenced \nby any of the blockers; therefore, drug Y must have a direct \nP-agonist effect on the heart. The answer is C. \n6. Drug Z causes tachycardia that is converted to bradycardia by \nhexamethonium and blocked completdy by atropine. This \nindicates that the tachycardia is a reflex evoked by muscarinic \nvasodilation. Drug Z causes bradycardia when the ganglia are \nblocked, indicating that it also has a direct muscarinic action on \nthe heart. This is confirmed by the ability of atropine to block \nboth the tachycardia and the bradycardia. The answer is A. \n7. Phenylephrine, an a. agonist, increases blood pressure and \ncauses bradycardia through the baroreceptor reflex.

The Skill \nKeeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nSYMPATHOPLEGICS \nSympathoplegic drugs interfere with sympathetic (SANS) con\u00ad\ntrol of cardiovascular function. The result is a reduction of one \nor more of the following: venous tone, heart rate, contractile force \nof the heart, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance (see \nFigure 6-4). Compensatory responses are significant for some of \nthese agents (Table 11-1). Sympathoplegics are subdivided by \nanatomic site of action (Figure 11-2). \nA. Baroreceptor-Sensitizing Agents \nA few natural products, such as vcratnun alkaloids, appear to \nincrease sensitivity of baroreceptor sensory nerves and reduce \nSANS outflow while increasing vagal tone to the heart.

This rebound increase in blood pres\u00ad\nsure can be controlled by reinstitution of donidine therapy or \nadministration of a blockers such as phentolamine. Methyldopa \noccasionally causes hematologic immunotoxicity, detected initially \nby test tube agglutination of red blood cells (positive Coombs test) \nand in some patients progressing to hemolytic anemia. Both drugs \nmay cause sedation-methyldopa more so at therapeutic dosage. \nEarly studies suggested that methyldopa protected kidney func\u00ad\ntion and was safe in pregnancy; it is therefore sometimes preferred \nfor hypertension in pregnancy. \nC. Ganglion-Blocking Drugs \nNicotinic blockers that act in the ganglia are very efficacious, but \nbecause their adverse effects are severe, they are now considered \nobsolete. Heumethooium and ttim.ethaphao are extremely \npowerful blood pressure-lowering ganglion-blocking drugs. \nD.

The major compensatory response is salt and water retention. \nIn high dosages, these drugs are very efficacious but produce severe \nadverse effects and are now considered obsolete for hypertension. \nMoooamioe o:DcLue (MAO) inhibitors were once used in \nhypenension because they cause the formation of a false transmit\u00ad\nter (octopamioe) in sympathetic postganglionic neuron termi\u00ad\nnals and lower blood pressure. Octopamine is stored, along with \nincreased amounts of norepinephrine, in the transmitter vesicles. \nSANS nerve impulses then release a mixture of octopamine (which has very low efficacy) and norepinephrine, resulting in a smaller \nthan normal adrenoceptor response. Large doses of indirect-acting \nsympathomimetics, on the other hand (eg, the tyramine in a meal \nof fermented foods}, may cause release of very large amounts of \nstored norepinephrine (along with the octopamine} and result in \na hypenensive crisis. (Recall that tyramine normally has very low \nbioavailability because of metabolism by MAO. In the presence of \nMAO inhibitors, it has much higher bioavailability.) Because of \nthis risk and the availability of better drugs, MAO inhibitors are no \nlonger used in hypertension. However, they are still occasionally \nused for treatment of severe depressive disorder (see Chapter 30). \nE. Adrenoceptor Blockers \nAlpha1-selective agents (eg, pram.sin, dox.azosin, terazosin) \nare moderately effective antihypertensive drugs. Alpha blockers \nreduce vascular resistance and venous return. The nonselective \nex blockers (phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine) are of no value \nin chronic hypertension because of excessive reflex tachycardia. \nAlpha 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers are relatively free of the \nsevere adverse effects of the nonselective ex blockers and postgan\u00ad\nglionic nerve terminal sympathoplegic agents. They do, however, \ncause orthostatic hypotension, especially with the first few doses. \nOn the other hand, they also relax smooth muscle in the prostate, \nwhich is useful in benign prostatic hyperplasia. \nBeta blockers are used very heavily in the treatment of hyperten\u00ad\nsion. Propranolol is the prototype, and ateoolol, metoprolol, and \ncarvedilol are among the most popular. They initially reduce car\u00ad\ndiac output, but in chronic use their action may include a decrease \nin vascular resistance as a contributing effect. The latter effect may \nresult from reduced angiotensin levels (p blockers reduce renin \nrelease from the kidney). Metoprolol, carvedilol, and labetalol, \nused chronically, also have beneficial effects in chronic heart fail\u00ad\nure. Nebivolol is a P blocker with some direct vasodilator action \ncaused by nitric oxide release. Potential adverse effects are listed in \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "the Drug Summary Table. & noted in Chapter 10, Pi-selective \nblockers with fewer CNS effects may have some advantages over \nthe nonselective and more lipid-soluble agents. \nVASODILATORS \nDrugs that dilate blood vessels by acting directly on smooth mus\u00ad\ncle cdls through nonautonomic mechanisms are useful in treating \nmany hypertensive patients. V asodilators act by four major mecha\u00ad\nnisms: blockade of calcium channels, release of nitric oxide, open\u00ad\ning of potassium channels (which leads to hyperpolarization), and \nactivation ofD1 dopamine receptors (Table 11-2). Compensatory \nresponses are listed in Table 11-1. \nA. calcium Channel-Blocking Agents \nCalcium channel blockers (eg, nif-edipine, verapamil, d.iltiazem) \nare effective vasodilators. Because they are moderately efficacious \nand orally active, these drugs are suitable for chronic use in hyper\u00ad\ntension of any severity. V erapamil and diltiazem also reduce cardiac \noutput in most patients. Nifedipine is the prototype dihydropyri\u00ad\ndine calcium channel blocker, and many other dihydropyridines are \navailable (amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, etc). Because they are \nwell-tolerated and produce fewer compensatory responses, the cal\u00ad\ncium channel blockers are much more commonly used than hydrala\u00ad\nzine or tninoxidil. They are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12. \nB. Hydralazine and Minoxidil \nThese older vasodilators have more effect on arterioles than on \nveins. They are orally active and suitable for chronic therapy. \nHydralazine apparently acts through the release of nitric oxide \nfrom endothelial cells. It causes significant baroreceptor homeo\u00ad\nstatic responses and must be combined with other drugs, usually \ndiuretics and P blockers. However, it is rarely used at high dos\u00ad\nage because of its toxicity (Drug Summary Table). Hydralazine\u00ad\ninduced lupus erythematosus is reversible upon stopping the drug, \nand lupus is less common at dosages below 200 mg/d. \nMinoxidil is extremely efficacious, and systemic administration is \nreserved for severe hypertension. Minoxidil is a prodrug; its metab\u00ad\nolite, minoxidil sulfate, is a potassium channel opener that hyper\u00ad\npolarizes and relaxes vascular smooth muscle. The compensatory \nresponses to minoxidil (Figure 11-1) require the concotnitant use of \nTABLE 11-2 Mechanisms of action of vasodilators. \nMec:h\u2022nllm of Smooth \nMuscle Relmtion \nReduction of calcium influx via \nL-type channels \nRelease of nitric oxide from \ndrug or Vilscular endothelium \nHyperpolarization of vascular \nsmooth muscle tnrough open\u00ad\ning of potassium channels \nActiViltion of dopamine D, \nreceptors Examples \nDihydropyridines : vessels > heart \nVerapamil, diltiazem: heart~ vessels \nNitroprusside, hydralazine \nMinoxidil sulfate, diazoxide \nFenoldopam CHAPTER 11 Drugs Used in Hypertension 97 \ndiuretics and P blockers. Because it can cause hirsutism, tninoxidil is \nalso available as a topical agent for the treatment of baldness. \nC. Nitroprusside, Diazoxide, and Fenoldopam \nThese parenteral vasodilators are used in hypertensive emergen\u00ad\ncies. Nitropru~ide is a light-sensitive, shon-acting agent (duration \nof action is a few minutes) that must be infused continuously. The \nrelease of nitric oxide (from the drug molecule itself) stimulates \nguanylyl cyclase and increases cyclic guanine monophosphate \n(cGMP) concentration and relaxation in vascular smooth muscle. \nDiazoxide is a thiazide derivative but lacks diuretic properties. \nIt is given as intravenous boluses or as an infusion and has several \nhours' duration of action. Diazoxide opens potassium channels, \nthus hyperpolarizing and relaxing smooth muscle cdls. This drug \nalso reduces insulin release and can be used to treat hypoglycemia \ncaused by insulin-producing tumors . \nDopamine D1 receptor activation by fenoldopam causes \nprompt, marked arteriolar vasodilation. This drug is given by intra\u00ad\nvenous infusion. It has a short duration of action (10 min) and, like \nnitroprusside and diazoxide, is used for hypertensive emergencies. \nANGIOTENSIN ANTAGONISTS&: \nA RENIN INHIBITOR \nThe two primary groups of angiotensin antagonists are the \nangiotmsin-amverting enzyme (ACE) inhibiton and the angio\u00ad\ntcnsin II receptor blochn (ARBs). ACE inhibitors (eg, captopril), \nwhich inhibit the enzyme variously known as angiotensin-converting \nenzyme, kininase II, and peptidyl dipeptidase, cause a rt:duction \nin blood levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) and aldosterone and an \nincrease in endogenous vasodilators of the kinin family (bradyki\u00ad\nnin; Figure 11-3). ACE inhibitors have a low incidence of serious \nadverse effects (except in pregnancy) when given in normal dos\u00ad\nage and produce minimal compensatory responses (fable 11-1). \nThe ACE inhibitors are useful in heart fuilure and diabetes as well \nas in hypertension. The toxicities of ACE inhibitors include cough \n(up to 30% of patients), hyperkalemia, and renal damage in occa\u00ad\nsional patients with preexisting renal vascular disease (although they \npro't\u00abt the diabetic kidney). They cause major renal damage in the \nfetus and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. In contrast, \nthey have beneficial effects in chronic heart fuilure and diabetic renal \ndisease. The second group of angiotensin antagonists, the receptor \nblockers, is represented by the orally active agents losartan, wlsar-\u00ad\ntan, irbesartan, candaartan, and other ARBs, which competitively \ninhibit angiotensin II at its AT 1 receptor site. ARBs appear to be as \neffective in lowering blood pressure as the ACE inhibitors and have \nthe advantage of a lower incidence of cough, although they do cause \nhyperkalernia. Like the ACE inhibitors, they cause fetal renal toxic\u00ad\nity and are thus contraindicated in pregnancy. \nAliskiren inhibits renin' s action on its substrate, angiotensino~ \ngen (Figure 11-3). It thus reduces the formation of angiotensin I \nand, in consequence, angiotensin II. Toxicities include headache \nand diarrhea. It does not appear to cause cough, but it is not \nyet known whether it has the other toxicities of the angiotensin \nantagonists. It does not show reproductive toxicity in animals but \nis considered to be contraindicated in pregnancy because of the \nknown toxicity of ACE inhibitors and ARBs."

If the patient has renal \nimpairment, is consuming a high-potassium diet, or is talcing \nother drugs that tend to conserve potassium, potassium concen\u00ad\ntrations may reach toxic levels. \nCLINICAL USES OFANTIHYPERTENSIVE \nDRUGS \nA. Stepped Care (Polypharmacy) \nBecause of the lack of symptoms in hypertension, routine blood \npressure screening is an important public health measure. Therapy \nof hypertension is complex because the disease is symptomless \nuntil far advanced and because the drugs may cause major com\u00ad\npensatory responses and significant toxicities. However, compen\u00ad\nsatory responses can usually be minimized and overall toxicity can \noften be reduced by the use of multiple drugs at lower dosages in \npatients with moderate or severe hypertension. Typically, drugs \nare added to a patient's regimen in stepwise fashion; each addi\u00ad\ntional agent is chosen from a different subgroup until adequate \nblood pressure control has been achieved. The usual steps include \n(1) lifestyle measures such as salt restriction and weight reduction, \n(2) diuretics (a thiazide}, (3) ACE inhibitors or ARBs, (4) vasodila\u00ad\ntors (usually a calcium channel blocker) or sympathoplegics (a J3 \nblocker) or both. The ability of drugs in steps 2, 3, and 4 to control the compensatory responses induced by the others should be noted \n(eg, propranolol reduces the tachycardia induced by hydralazine}. \nThus, rational polypharmacy minimizes toxicities while producing \nadditive or supra-additive therapeutic effects. \nIn severe, acute hypertension, pressure should be reduced grad\u00ad\nually (see Hypertensive Emergency section, below). \nSKILL KEEPER 2: COMPENSATORY \nRESPONSES TO ANTI HYPERTENSIVE \nDRUGS (SEE CHAPTER 6) \nIf hydralazine is administered in moderate dosage for \nseveral weeks, compensatory cardiac and renal responses \nwill be observed. Specify the exact mechanisms and struc\u00ad\ntures involved in these responses. The Skill Keeper Answer \nappears at the end of the chapter. \nB. Monotherapy \nIt has been found in large clinical studies that many patients do well \non a single drug (eg, an ACE inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, \nor combination ex and~ blocker}. This approach to the treatment \nof mild and moderate hypertension has become more popular than \nstepped care because of its simplicity, better patient compliance, \nand-with modern drugs-a relatively low incidence of toxicity. \nC. Age and Ethnicity \nOlder patients of most races respond better to diuretics and \n~ blockers than to ACE inhibitors. African Americans of all ages \nrespond better to diuretics and calcium channel blockers, and they \nrespond less well to ACE inhibitors. There is considerable interin\u00ad\ndividual variability in metabolism of J3 blockers. \nD. Hypertensive Emergency \nHypertensive emergency (formerly called malignant hyperten~ \nsion) is an accelerated form of severe hypertension associated with \nrising blood pressure and rapidly progressing damage to vessels \nand end organs. Management of hypertensive emergency must be \ncarried out on an urgent basis in the hospital. Powerful vasodila\u00ad\ntors (nitroprusside, fenoldopam, or diazoxide) are combined with \ndiuretics (furosemide) and ~ blockers to lower blood pressure to \nthe (140-160)/(90-110) mm Hg range promptly (within a few \nhours). Further reduction is then pursued more slowly. \nQUESTIONS \nI. A 32-year-old woman with hypertension wishes to become \npregnant. Her physician informs her that she will have to \nswitch to another antihypertensive drug.

Methyldopa is often rt:commmd.ed in pregnant patients \nbecause it has a ~od safety record. Calcium channel blockers \n(choice D) and p blockers (choices A and E) are not contrain\u00ad\ndicated. In contrast, ACE inhibitors andARBs (choice B) have \nbeen shown to be teratogenic, causing severe renal abnormali\u00ad\nties in the fetus. The answer is B. \n2. ACE inhibitors (choice A), ARBs (choice C), and diuretics \n(choice B) do not significantly increase heart rate. Although \ndihydropyridine calcium channel blockers do not usually \nreduce rate markedly (and may increase it), verapamil (choice \nE) and diltiazem do inhibit the sinoatrial node and predict\u00ad\nably decrease rate. Other direct vasodilators (choice D) reg\u00ad\nularly inmase heart rate, and minoxidil, a very efficacious \nvasodilator, may cause severe tachycardia that must be con\u00ad\ntrolled with ~ blockers. The answer is D. \n3. Nifedipine is a prototype L-type calcium channel blocker and \nlowers blood pressure by reducing calcium influx into vascu\u00ad\nlar smooth muscle. It has no effect on angiotensin~converting \nenzyme. Calcium efflux from skeletal muscle cells does not \ninvolve the L-type ca2+ channel. The plasma renin level may \ninert:ase as a result of the compensatory response to reduced \nblood pressure. Calcium channel blockers have negligible \neffects on urine calcium. The answer is D. \n4. Drug-induced postural (orthostatic) hypotension is usually \ndue to venous pooling or excessive diuresis and inadequate \nblood volume. Venous pooling is normally prevented by \na-receptor activation in vascular smooth muscle; thus, ortho\u00ad\nstatic hypotension may be caused or exacerbated by <X1 block\u00ad\ners, cg, prazosin.

Verapamil (choice A) \noften causes constipation, probably by blocking L-type calcium \nchannels in the colon. The answer is A. \n7. Atenolol, but not prazosin, may decrease heart rate (choice \nA). Prazosin, but not atenolol, may increase cardiac output, a \ncompensatory effect (choice B). Prazosin may increase renin \noutput (a compensatory response), but P blockers inhibit its \nrelease by the kidney (choice C). By reducing blood pressure, \nboth may increase central sympathetic outflow (a compensa\u00ad\ntory response). Beta blockers do not cause orthostatic hypo\u00ad\ntension. The answer is D. \n8.

Note that several of these variables arc increased by sympa\u00ad\nthetic discharge. \nPrdoad (diastolic filling pressure) is a function of blood vol\u00ad\nume and venous tone. Venous tone is mainly controlled by sympa\u00ad\nthetic activity. Afterload is determined by arterial blood pressure \nand large artery stiffness. It is one of the systolic determinants of \noxygen requirement. \nHeart rate contributes to total fiber tension because at fast \nheart rates, fibers spend more time at systolic tension lcvds. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, at faster rates, diastole is abbreviated, and diastole con\u00ad\nstitutes the time available for coronary flow (coronary blood flow \nis low or nil during systole). Heart rate may he multiplied by sys\u00ad\ntolic blood pressure to yidd the double product, a measure of \ncardiac work and therefore of oxygen requirement. As intensity of \nexercise (eg, running on a treadmill) increases, demand for cardiac \noutput increases, so the double product also increases. However, \nthe double product is sensitive to sympathetic tone, as is cardiac \noxygen demand (Figure 12-1). In patients with atherosclerotic \nangina, effective drugs reduce the double product by reducing car\u00ad\ndiac work without reducing exercise capacity. \nForce of cardiac cont.raction is another systolic factor con\u00ad\ntrolled mainly by sympathetic outflow to the heart. Ejection time \nfor ventricular contraction is inversdy related to force of contrac\u00ad\ntion but is also influenced by impedance to outflow. Increased \nejection time (prolonged systole) increases oxygen requirement. \nTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES \nThe defect that causes anginal pain is inadequate coronary oxygen \ndelivery relative to the myocardial oxygen requirement. This defect \ncan be corrected-at present-in two ways: by increasing oxygen \ndelivery and by reducing oxygen requirement (Figure 12-2). \nTraditional pharmacologic therapies include the nitrates, the \ncalcium channel blockers, and the P blockers. \nA newer strategy attempts to increase the efficiency of oxygen \nutilhation by shifting the energy substrate preference of the heart \nfrom fatty acids to glucose. Drugs that may act by this mechanism \nare termed partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors (pFOX inhibiton) \nand include ranolazine and trimetazidine. However, evidence \nsuggests that the major mechanism of action of ranolazine is inhi\u00ad\nbition of late sodium current (see below). Another new group of \nantlanginal drugs selectively reduces heart rate (and oxygen require\u00ad\nment) with no other detectable hemodynamic effects. These drugs \n(ivabradine is the prototype) act by inhibition of the sinoatrial \npacemaker current, Ir. \nThe nitrates, calcium blockers, and P blockers all rt!duce the car\u00ad\ndiac oxygen mptirement in atherosclerotic angina. Ivahradine and \nranolazine also reduce the oxygen requirement. Nitrates and cal\u00ad\ncium channel blockers (but not P blockers) can also increase oxygen \ndelivery by reducing spasm in vasospastic angina. Myoca:rdial \nrevascularizatlon corrects coronary obstruction either by bypass \ngrafting or by angioplasty (enlargement of the coronary lumen by \nmeans of special catheters and stents). \nTherapy of unstable angina differs from that of stable angina in \nthat urgent angioplasty is the treatment of choice in most patients Coronary \nvasodilation \nReduced \nrequirement \nOxygen requirement Coronary \nobstruction \n* = Anginal pain \nFIGURE 12-2 Strategies for the treatment of effort angina. \nWhen coronary flow is adequate, oxygen delivery increases as \noxygen requirement increases with exercise (black line). Angina is \ncharacterized by reduced coronary oxygen dellvery versus oxygen \nrequirement (curve in red line), and anginal pain (asterisks) occurs as \nthe oxygen debt increases. In some cases, this can be corrected by \nincreasing oxygen delivery (revascularization or, in the case of revers\u00ad\nible vasospasm, nitrates and calcium channel blockers, brown arrow). \nMore often, drugs are used to reduce oxygen requirement (nitrates, \nJ3 blockers, and calcium channel blockers) and slow or reverse prog\u00ad\nress along the red line (blue arrow, reduced requirement). \nand platelet clotting is the major target of drug therapy. A variety \nof platelet inhibitors are used in this condition (see Chapter 34). \nIntravenous nitroglycerin is sometimes of value in unstable angina. \nNITRATES \nA. Classification and Pharmacokinetics \nNitroglycerin (the active ingredient in dynamite) is the most \nimportant of the therapeutic nitrates and is available in forms that \nprovide a range of durations of action from 10-20 min (sublingual \nfor relief of acute attacks) to 8-10 h {transdermal for prophylaxis) \n(see the Drug Summary Table at the end of the chapter). Nitro\u00ad\nglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is rapidly denitrated in the liver and \nin smooth muscle-first to the two dinitrates (glyceryl dinitrates), \nwhich retain a significant vasodilating effect; and more slowly to \nthe mononitrates, which are much less active. Because of the high \nenzyme activity in the liver, the first-pass effect for nitroglycerin \nis about 90%. The efficacy of oral (swallowed) nitroglycerin prob\u00ad\nably results from the high levels of glyceryl dinitrates in the blood. \nThe effects of sublingual and transdermal nitroglycerin are mainly \nthe result of the unchanged trinitrate drug because these routes \navoid the first\u00b7pass effect (see Chapters 1 and 3). \nOther nitrates are similar to nitroglycerin in their pharmaco\u00ad\nkinetics and pharmacodynamics. Isosorbide dinitrate is another \ncommonly used nitrate; it is available in sublingual and oral forms. \nIsosorbide dinitrate is rapidly denitrated in the liver and smooth \nmuscle to isosorbide mononitrate, which is also active. Isosor\u00ad\nbide mononitrate is available as a separate drug for oral use. Several"

The veins are the most sensitive of the vascular beds \nto nitric oxide, arteries less sensitive, and arterioles least sensi\u00ad\ntive. Venodilation leads to decreased diastolic heart size and fiber \ntension. Aneriolar dilation leads to reduced peripheral resistance \nand blood pressure. These changes contribute to an overall redu~ \ntion in myocardial fiber tension, oxygen consumption, and the \ndouble product. Thus, the primary mechanism of the therapeu\u00ad\ntic benefit of nitrates in atherosclerotic angina is reduction of the \noxygen requirement. A secondary mechanism-namdy, an \nincrease in coronary flow via collateral vessels in ischemic ateas\u00ad\nmay also contribute. In vasospastic angina, reversal of coronary \nspasm and increased flow can be demonstrated. Nitrates have no \ndirect effects on cardiac muscle, but significant reflex tachycardia \nand increased force of contraction are common results when nitro\u00ad\nglycerin reduces the blood pressure. These compensatory effects \nresult from the batoreceptor mechanism shown in Figure 6-4. \n2. Other organs-Nitrates relax the smooth muscle of the bron\u00ad\nchi, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract, but these effects \nare too small to be clinically significant. Intravenous nitroglycerin \n(sometimes used in unstable angina) reduces platdet aggregation. \nThere are no clinically useful effects on other tissues. \nD. Clinical Uses \nAs previously noted, nitroglycerin is available in several formula\u00ad\ntions (see Drug Summary Table). The standatdform for treatment \nof acute anginal pain is the sublingual tablet or spray, which has a \nduration of action of 10-20 min. Sublingual isosorbide dinitrate \nis similar with a duration of 20-30 min. Oral (swallowed) normal\u00ad\nrdease formulations of nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate have \ndurations of action of 4-6 h. Sustained-release oral forms have \na somewhat longer duration of action. Transdermal formulations \n(ointment or patch) can maintain nitrate blood levels for up to \n24 h. However, tolerance develops after 8-10 h, with rapidly \ndiminishing effectiveness thereafter. It is therefore recommended \nthat nitroglycerin patches be removed after 10-12 h. A new patch \ncan be applied after 12 h of patch-free recovery. \nE. Toxicity of Nitrates and Nitrites \nThe most common adverse effects of nitrates are the responses \nevoked by vasodilation. These include tachycardia (from the baro\u00ad\nreceptor reflex), orthostatic hypotension (a direct extension of \nthe venodilator effect}, and throbbing headache from meningeal \nartery vasodilation. \nNitrates interact with sildenafll and similar drugs (tadalafll, \nvardenaftl, avanafll) promoted for erectile dysfunction. These \nagents inhibit a phosphodiesterase isoform (PDE5) that metab\u00ad\nolizes cGMP in smooth muscle (Figure 12-4). The increased \ncGMP in erectile smooth muscle relaxes it, allowing for greater \ninflow of blood and more effective and prolonged erection. This \nrelaxation also occurs in vascular smooth muscle. As a result, the \ncombination of nitrates (through increased production of cGMP) \nand a PDE5 inhibitor (through decreased breakdown of cGMP) \ncauses a synergistic relaxation of vascular smooth muscle with GTP \nGu811ylyl cyclase ~ \ncGMP Smooth muscle /':\"\"\" Erectile tissue ____ ..., relaxation Blood vessels \nGMP Sildenafil, vardenafil, \ntadalafil \nFIGURE 12-4 Mechanism of the interaction between nitrates \nand drugs used in erectile dysfunction.

GTP, guanoslne trlphosphate. \npotentially dangerous hypotension and inadequate perfusion of \ncritical organs. \nNitrites {not nitrates} ate of significant toxicologic importance \nbecause they cause methemoglobinemia at high blood concentra\u00ad\ntions. This same effect has a potential antidotal action in cyanide \npoisoning (sec later discussion). The nitrates do not cause methe\u00ad\nmoglobinemia. In the past, the nitrates were responsible for several \noccupational diseases in explosives factories in which workplace \ncontamination by these volatile chemicals was severe. The most \ncommon of these diseases was \"Monday disease,~ that is, the alter\u00ad\nnating development of tolerance (during the work week) and loss \nof tolerance (over the weekend) for the vasodilating action and \nits associated tachycardia and resulting in headache (from cranial \nvasodilation), tachycardia, and dizziness (from orthostatic hypo\u00ad\ntension} every Monday. \nF. Nitrites In the Treatment of Cyanide Poisoning \nCyanide ion rapidly complexes with the iron in cytochrome oxi\u00ad\ndase, resulting in a block of oxidative metabolism and cell death. \nFortunately, the iron in methemoglobin has a higher affinity for \ncyanide than does the iron in cytochrome oxidase. Nitrites con\u00ad\nvert the ferrous iron in hemoglobin to the ferric form, yielding \nmethemoglobin. Therefore, cyanide poisoning can be treated by \na 3-step procedure: (1) immediate inhalation of amyl nitrite, fol\u00ad\nlowed by (2) intravenous administration of sodium nitrite, which \nrapidly increases the methemoglobin level to the degree neces\u00ad\nsary to remove a significant amount of cyanide from cytochrome \noxidase and form cyanomethemoglobin. Steps (1) and (2) are \nfollowed by (3) intravenous sodium thiosulfate, which converts \ncyanomethemoglobin resulting from step 2 to thiocyanate and \nmethemoglobin. Thiocyanate is much less toxic than cyanide and \nis excreted by the kidney. (Note that excessive methemoglobinemia \nis fatal because methcmoglobin is a very poor oxygen cattier.) An \nalternative antidote, hydromcobalamin, a form of vitamin Bw \nhas become the preferred method of treating cyanide poisoning \n(see Chapter 58)."

Classification and Pharmacokinetics \nSeveral types of calcium channel blockers are approved for use in \nangina; these drugs are typified by nifalipine, a dihydropyridine, sev\u00ad\neral other dihydropyridines, and the nondihydropyridines diltiamn \nand venpamil. Although calcium channel blockers differ markedly in \nstructure, all are orally active and most have half-lives of 3--6 h. \nB. Mechanism of Action \nCalcium channel blockers block voltage-gated L-type calcium \nchannels, the calcium channels most important in cardiac and \nsmooth muscle, and reduce intracellular calcium concentration and \nmuscle contractility (Figure 12-3). None of these channel block\u00ad\ners interferes with calcium-dependent neurotransmission or hor\u00ad\nmone release because these processes use different calcium channels \nthat are not blocked by L-channd blockers. Nerve ending calcium \nchannels are of the N-, P-, and R-types. Secretory cells use L-type \nchannels, but these variant channels are less sensitive to the calcium \nblockers than are cardiac and smooth muscle L-type channels. \nC. Effects and Clinical Use \nCalcium blockers relax blood vessel smooth muscle and, to a lesser \nextent, the uterus, bronchi, and gut. The rate and contractility of \nthe heart are reduced by diltiazem and veraparnil. Because they \nblock calcium-dependent conduction in the atrioventricular (AV) \nnode, verapamil and diltiazem may be used to treat AV-nodal \narrhythmias (see Chapter 14). Nifedipine and other dihydropyri\u00ad\ndines evoke greater vasodilation, and the resulting sympathetic \nreflex prevents bradycardia and may actually increase heart rate. \nAll the calcium channel blockers in sufficient dosage reduce blood \npressure and reduce the double product in patients with angina. \nCalcium blockers are effective as prophylactic therapy in both \neffort and vasospastic angina; nifedipine has also been used to abort \nacute anginal attacks but use of the prompt-release form is contra\u00ad\nindicated (see Skill Keeper). In severe atherosclerotic angina, these \ndrugs are particularly valuable when combined with nitrates (Table \n12-1). In addition to well-established uses in angina, hypertension, \nand supraventricular tachycardia, some of these agents are used in \nmigraine, preterm labor, stroke, and Raynaud phenomenon. SKILL KEEPER: NIFEDIPINE CARDIOTOXICITY \n(SEE CHAPTER 6) \nA pair of studies during the 1990s suggested that use of nife\u00ad\ndipine was associated with an increased risk of myocardial \ninfarction. What effects of nifedipine might lead to this result? \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nD. Toxicity \nThe calcium channel blockers may cause constipation, pretibial \nedema, nausea, flushing, and dizziness. More serious adverse \neffects include heart failure, AV blockade, and sinus node depres\u00ad\nsion; these are most common with verapamil and least common \nwith the dihydropyridines . \nBETA-BLOCKING DRUGS \nA. Classification and Mechanism of Action \nThese drugs are described in detail in Chapter 10. Because they \nreduce cardiac work (and oxygen demand), all P blockers are effec\u00ad\ntive in the prophylaxis of atherosclerotic angina attacks. \nB. Effects and Clinical Use \nActions include both beneficial antianginal effects (decreased \nheart rate, cardiac force, blood pressure) and detrimental effects \n(increased heart size, longer ejection period; Table 12-1). Like \nnitrates and calcium channd blockers, ~ blockers reduce cardiac \nwork, the double product, and oxygen demand. \nBeta blockers are used only for prophylactic therapy of angina; \nthey are of no value in an acute attack. They are effective in pre\u00ad\nventing exercise-induced angina but are not effective against the \nvasospastic form, The combination of ~ blockers and nitrates \nis useful because the adverse undesirable compensatory effects \nevoked by the nitrates (tachycardia and increased cardiac force) are \nprevented or reduced by P blockade (Table 12-1). \nC.

            "Text": "CHAPTER 12 Drugs Used in the Treatment of Angina Pectoris 109 \nNEWER DRUGS \nRanolazine appears to act mainly by reducing a late, prolonged \nsodium current in myocardial cells. The decrease in intracel\u00ad\nlular sodium causes an increase in calcium expulsion via the \nNa/Ca transporter (see Chapter 13) and a reduction in cardiac \nforce and work. & noted previously, it may also alter cardiac \nmetabolism at higher doses. Ranolazine is moderately effective in \nangina prophylaxis. lvabradine, a drug used in heart failure, inhib\u00ad\nits the Ir sodium current in the sinoatrial node. The reduction in \nthis hyperpolarization-induced inward pacemaker current results \nin decreased heart rate and consequently, decreased cardiac work \nand oxygen requirement. lvabradine is used off-label with P block\u00ad\ners as prophylaxis in angina. Investigational drugs include fasudil, a \nrho kinase inhibitor, and nicorandil, a potassium channel opener. \nNONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY \nMyocardial revascularization by coronary artery bypass graft\u00ad\ning (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty \n(PTCA) are extremely important in the treatment of severe angina. \nThese are the only methods capable of consistently increasing coro\u00ad\nnary flow in atherosclerotic angina and increasing the double product. \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1-4. A 57-year-old woman presents to her primary care \nphysician with a complaint of severe chest pain when she walks \nuphill in cold weather. The pain disappears when she rests. She has \na 40-pack-year history of smoking but her plasma lipids are within \nthe normal range. After evaluation and discussion of treatment \noptions, a decision is made to treat her with nitroglycerin. \n1. Which of the following is a common direct or reflex effect of \nnitroglycerin? \n(A) Decreased heart rate \n(B) Decreased venous capacitance \n(C) Increased afterload \n(D) Increased cardiac force \n(E) Increased diastolic myocardial fiber tension \n2.

One year later, the patient returns complaining that her nitro\u00ad\nglycerin works well when she takes it for an acute attack but \nthat she is now having more frequent attacks and would like \nsomething to prevent them. Useful drugs for the prophylaxis \nof angina of effort include \n(A) Amyl nitrite \n(B) Esmolol \n(C) Sublingual isosorbide dinitrate \n(D) Sublingual nitroglycerin \n(E) Verapamil 4. If a P blocker were to be used for prophylaxis in this patient, \nwhat is the most probable mechanism of action in angina? \n(A) Block of exercise-induced tachycardia \n(B) Decreased end-diastolic ventricular volume \n(C) Increased double product \n(D) Increased cardiac force \n(E) Decreased ventricular ejection time \n5. A new 60-year-old patient presents to the medical clinic with \nhypertension and angina. He is 1.8 meters tall with a waist \nmeasurement of 1.1 m. Weight is 97 kg, blood pressure is \n150/95 mm Hg, and pulse is 85.

Which of the following interacts with nitroglyc\u00ad\nerin by inhibiting the metabolism of cGMP? \n(A) Atenolol \n(B) Hydralazine \n(C) Isosorbide mononitrate \n(D) Nifedipine \n(E) Ranolazine \n(F) Sildenafil \n(G) Terbutaline \nANSWERS \n1. Nitroglycerin increases heart rate and venous capacitance and \ndecnases afterload and diastolic fiber tension. It increases car\u00ad\ndiac contractile force because the decrease in blood pressure \nevokes a compensatory increase in sympathetic discharge. \nThe answer is D. \n2. The nitrates relax many types of smooth muscle, but the effi:ct \non motility in the colon is insignificant. Nitroglycerin causes \nhypotension as a result of arterial and venous dilation. Dilation \nof arteries in the meninges has no effi:ct on central nervous \nsystem function but does cause headache. The answer is D. \n3. The calcium channel blockers and the P blockers are gener\u00ad\nally effi:ctive in reducing the number of attacks of angina of \neffort, and most have durations of 4--8 h. Oral and trans\u00ad\ndermal nitrates have similar or longer durations. Amyl nitrite \nand the sublingual nitrates have short durations of action (a \nfew minutes to 30 min). Esmolol {an intravenous ~ blocker) \nmust be given intravenously and also has a very short dura\u00ad\ntion of action. Thus, nitrites, sublingual nitrates, and esmolol \nare of no value in prophylaxis. The answer is E. \n4. Propranolol blocks tachycardia but has none of the other \neffects listed. Only revascularization increases double prod\u00ad\nuct; drugs that decrease cardiac work increase exercise time by \ndecreasing double product. The answer is A. \n5. Both drugs cause venodilation and reduce venous return suf\u00ad\nficiently to cause some degree of postural hypotension. Bra\u00ad\ndycardia, lupus, and urinary retention occur with neither of \nthem, but prazosin has been used to rdieve urinary retention \nin men with prostatic hyperplasia. While this patient has a \nhigh body mass index of 29.9, weight gain is not a risk with \neither drug. The answer is D. \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: 6. Read carefully! Nitrites, not nitrates, cause methemoglobin\u00ad\nemia in adults. Methemoglobinemia is deliberately induced \nin one of the treatments of cyanide poisoning. Amyl nitrite \nand isobutyl nitrite, obtained as street drugs, have been heav\u00ad\nily used as sex-enhancers. The answer is A. \n7. Isosorbide dinitrate (like all the nitrates) and prazosin can cause \nreflex tachycardia. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium \nchannel blocker, causes much more vasodilation than cardiac \ndepression and may also cause reflex tachycardia. Verapamil \ntypically slows heart rate and high doses may cause severe bra\u00ad\ndycardia. The answer is E. \n8. Acute migraine headache is associated with vasodilation of \nmeningeal arteries. Of the drugs listed, only nitroglycerin is \ncommonly associated with headache. In fact, calcium channel \nblockers and P blockers have been used with some success as \nprophylaxis for migraine. The answer is D. \n9. The effects of ~ blockers and nitrates on heart size, force, \nvenous tone, and heart rate are opposite. The effi:cts of \nfi blockers and calcium channel blockers on heart size, force, \nand rate are similar. The answer is D. \n10. Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase 5, an enzyme that inacti\u00ad\nvates cGMP. The nitrates (via nitric oxide) increase the synthe\u00ad\nsis of cGMP. This combination is synergistic. The answer is F. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: NIFEDIPINE \nCARDIOTOXICITY (SEE CHAPTER 6) \nSeveral studies have suggested that patients receiving \nprompt-release nifedipine may have an increased risk of \nmyocardial infarction. Slow-release formulations do not seem \nto impose this risk. These observations have been explained \nas follows: Rapid-acting vasodilators-such as nifedipine in \nits prompt-release formulation-cause significant and sud\u00ad\nden reduction in blood pressure. The drop in blood pressure \nevokes increased sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular \nsystem and increases heart rate and force of contraction \nby the mechanism shown in Figure 6-4. These changes can \nmarkedly increase cardiac oxygen requirement. If coro-\nnary blood flow does not increase sufficiently to match the \nincreased requirement , ischemia and infarction can result. \nD Describe the pathophysiology of effort angina, vasospastic angina, and unstable \nangina; list the major determinants of cardiac oxygen consumption. \nD List the strategies and targets of the drugs used for relief of anginal pain. \nD Contrast the therapeutic and adverse effects of nitrates, p blockers, and calcium \nchannel blockers when used for angina. \nD Explain why the combination of a nitrate with a p blocker or a calcium channel blocker \nmay be more effective than either alone. \nD Explain why the combination of a nitrate and sildenafil is potentially dangerous. \nD Contrast the effects of medical therapy and surgical therapy of angina. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

A poorly understood defect in cardiac con\u00ad\ntractility is complicated by multiple compensatory proc.csses that C H A P T E R \nfurther weaken the failing heart.

The fundamental physiologic defect in heart failure is \na decrease in cardW: output relative to the needs of the body, and \nthe major manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue. The causes of heart \nfailure are still not completely undenitood. In some cases, it can be \nascribed to simple loss of functional myocardium, as in myocardial \ninfuction. It is frequently associated with chronic hypertension, val\u00ad\nvular disease, wronary artety disease, and a variety of cardiomyopa\u00ad\nthies. More than one third of the cases are associated with a reduction \nof cardiac contractile force and ejection fuction (systolic failure, heart \n&ilure with .raluc:cd ejection &action [HFrF.F]). Another large \ngroup of cases is caused by stiffening or other changes in the ven\u00ad\ntricles that prevent adequate filling during diastole; ejection volume \n(stroke volume) is reduced but ejection faction is normal (diastolic \nfailure, heart &ilure with praenal ejection &action [HFpEF]). \nThe remaining cases can be attributed to a combination of systolic \nand diastolic dysfunction. \nThe severity of heart failure is traditionally indicated on the \nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) scale, which places patients \n112 Miscellaneous drugs for chronic failure \nI L I I Loop diuretics, Beta anglotensin inhibitors, blockers, nesirltide, saai:>itril. spironolactone SGL T2 inhibitors \nat step I if symptoms occur only with maximal exercise, steps II \nand III with symptoms that occur with marked (II) or mild (III) \nexercise, and step IV if severe symptoms are present at rest. The \nnatural history of heart failure is characterized by a slow deterio\u00ad\nration of cardiac function, punctuated by episodes of acute car\u00ad\ndiac decompensation that are often associated with pulmonary or \nperipheral edema or both (congestive heart failure). \nThe reduction in cardiac output is best shown by the ventricu\u00ad\nlar function curve (Frank-Starling curve; Figure 13--1). Changes \nin the ventricular function curve reflect some compensatory \nresponses of the body and demonstrate some of the responses \nto drugs. As ventricular ejection decreases in HFrEF, the end\u00ad\ndiastolic fiber length increases, as shown by the shift from point \nA to point B in Figure 13--1. Operation at point B is intrinsi\u00ad\ncally less efficient than operation at shorter fiber lengths because \nof the increase in myocardial oxygen requirement associated with \nincreased fiber tension and length (see Figure 12-1). \nThe homeostatic responses to depressed cardiac output are \nextremdy important and are mediated mainly by the sympathetic \nnervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldoscerone system. \nThey are summarized in Figure 13-2.

Cardiomegaly (enlargement), \nremodeling of the heart, and slower compensatory responses, medi\u00ad\nated at least in part by sympathetic discharge and angiotensin II, \nare common. Although these compensatory responses can tem\u00ad\nporarily improve cardiac output (point C in Figure 13-1), they \nalso increase the load on the heart, and the increased load con\u00ad\ntributes to further long-term decline in cardiac function. Apop\u00ad\ntosis is a later response, and results in a reduction in the number \nof functioning myocytes. Evidence suggests that catecholamines, \nangiotensin II, and aldosterone play a direct role in these patho\u00ad\nphysiologic changes. \nTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES \nPharmacologic therapies for heart failure include the removal \nof retained salt and water with diuretics; reduction of afterload \nand salt and water retention by means of angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors; reduction of excessive sympathetic \nstimulation by means of p blockers; reduction of preload or after\u00ad\nload with vasodilators; and in systolic failure, direct augmentation \nof depressed cardiac contractility with positive inotropic drugs \nsuch as digitalis glycosides. Considerable evidence indicates that \nangiotensin antagonists, certain P-adrenoceptor blockers, and \nthe aldosterone antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone also \nhave long-term beneficial effects. These drug classes and targets \nare summarized in Table 13-1. The use of diuretics, the first-line \ntreatment for heart failure, is discussed in Chapter 15. \nCurrent clinical evidence suggests that acute heart failure \nshould be treated with a loop diuretiq if severe, a prompt-acting \npositive inotropic agent such as a P agonist or phosphodiester\u00ad\nase inhibitor, and vasodilaton should also be used as required \nto optimize filling pressures and blood pressure. Chronic failure is best treated with diuretics, usually a loop agent (sometimes in \ncombination with spironolactone) plus an ACE inhibitor and, \nif tolerated, a J! blocker. Digitalis may be helpful if systolic dys\u00ad\nfunction is prominent. N esiritide, a recombinant form of brain \nnatriuretic peptide (BNP), has vasodilating and diuretic properties \nand is heavily promoted for use in acute failure. A newer combina\u00ad\ntion drug, sacubitrillvalsarta.n, combines the actions of increased \nendogenous BNP with those of the angiotensin receptor blocker \nvalsartan, see below. \nCARDIAC GL YCOSIDES \nDigitalis glycosides are no longer considered first-line drugs in the \ntreatment of heart failure. However, because they are not discussed \nelsewhere in this book, we begin our discussion with this group. \nA. Prototypes and Pharmacokinetics \nAll cardiac glycosides are cardenolides (they include a steroid \nnucleus and a lactone ring); most also have one or more sugar \nresidues, justifying the designation as a glycoside. The cardiac gly\u00ad\ncosides used clinically are often called \"digitalis\" because several \ncome from the digitalis (foxglove) plant. Digoxin is the proto\u00ad\ntype agent and the only one commonly used in the United States. \nDigitoxin is a very similar but longer-acting molecule; it also \ncomes from the foxglove plant but is no longer available in the \nUnited States. Digoxin has an oral bioavailability of 60-75%, and \na half-life of 36--40 h. Elimination is by renal excretion (about \n60%) and hepatic metabolism (40%). \nB.

These beneficial effects permit a decrease \nin the compensatory sympathetic and renal responses previously \ndescribed. The decrease in sympathetic tone is especially benefi\u00ad\ncial: reduced heart rate, preload, and afterload permit the heart to \nfunction more efficiently (point C in Figure 13-1 may approach \npoint A as the function curve approaches normal). \n2. Electrical effects-Electrical effects include early cardiac \nparasympathomimetic responses and later arrhythmogenic actions. \nThey are summarized in Table 13-2. \na. Early responses-Increased PR interval, caused by the decrease \nin atrioventricular (AV) conduction vdocity, and flattening of the \nT wave are common electrocardiogram (ECG) effects. The effects on \nthe atria and AV node are largely parasympathetic (mediated by the \nvagus nerve) and can be partially blocked by atropine. The increase in \nthe AV nodal refractory period is particularly important when atrial \nflutter or fibrillation is present because the refractoriness of the AV \nnode determines the ventricular rate in these arrhythmias. The effect \nof digitalis is to slow ventricular rate. Shortened Q'.f interval, inver\u00ad\nsion of the T wave, and ST segment depression may occur later. \nb. Toxic responses-Increased automaticity, caused by intra\u00ad\ncellular calcium overload, is the most important manifestation of \ndigitalis toxicity. Intracellular calcium overload results in delayed \naftcrdepolarizations (DADs), which arc evoked by coupling of Na\u2022 \ninflux to ca2+ effiux. These afterdepolarizations may evoke extra\u00ad\nsystoles, tachycardia, or fibrillation in any part of the heart. In the \nventricles, the extrasystolcs arc rccogni2:cd as premature ventricular \nbeats (PVBs). When PVBs are coupled to normal beats in a 1:1 \nfashion, the rhythm is called bigcminy (Figure 13-4). \nD. Cllnlcal Uses \n1. Congestive heart failure-Digitalis is the traditional posi\u00ad\ntive inotropic agent used in the treatment of chronic heart failure. \nHowever, careful clinical studies indicate that while digitalis may \nimprove functional status (reducing symptoms), it does not prolong \nlife. Other agents (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, vasodilators) may be \nequally effective and less toxic, and some of these alternative therapies do prolong life (see later discussion). Because the half-lives of cardiac \nglycosides arc long, the drugs accumulate significantly in the body, \nand dosing regimens must be carefully designed and monitored. \n2. Atrlalflbrlllatlon-In atrial flutter and fibrillation, it is desir\u00ad\nable to reduce the conduction vdocity or increase the refractory \nperiod of the AV node so that ventricular rate is controlled within \na range compatible with efficient filling and ejection. The para\u00ad\nsympathomimctic action of digitalis often accomplishes this thera\u00ad\npeutic objective, although high doses may be required. Alternative \ndrugs for rate control include ~ blockers and calcium channel \nblockers, but these drugs have negative inotropic effects. \nE. lnteradlons \nQuinidine causes a well-documented reduction in digoxin clear\u00ad\nance and can increase the scrum digoxin level if digoxin dosage \nis not adjusted. Several other drugs have the same effect (amioda\u00ad\nrone, verapamil, others), but the interactions with these drugs are \nnot clinically significant. Digitalis toxicity, especially arrhythmo\u00ad\ngenesis, is increased by hypokalemia. hypomagnesemia, and hyper\u00ad\ncalcemia. (Hypokalemia has a dual arrhythmogenic interaction: it \npermits increased binding of digoxin to the Na+ /K+ -ATPasc as well \nas directly potentiating automaticity.) Loop diuretics and thiazides \nmay significantly reduce serum potassium and thus precipitate \ndigitalis toxicity. Digitalis-induced vomiting may deplete scrum \nmagnesium and similarly facilitate toxicity. These ion interactions \nare important when treating digitalis toxicity. \nNSR PVB \n,---'----, ~ \nFIGURE 13-4 Electrocardiographic record showing digitalis\u00ad\ninduced bigeminy.

            "Text": "F. Digitalis Toxicity \nThe major signs of digitalis toxicity are arrhythmias, nausea, vom\u00ad\niting, and diarrhea. Rarely, confusion or hallucinations and visual \nor endocrine aberrations may occur. Arrhythmias are common \nand dangerous. Chronic intoxication is an extension of the thera\u00ad\npeutic effect of the drug and is caused by excessive calcium accu\u00ad\nmulation in cardiac cells (calcium overload). This overload triggers \nabnormal automaticity and the arrhythmias noted in Table 13-2. \nSevere, acute intoxication caused by suicidal or accidental \nextreme overdose results in cardiac depression leading to cardiac \narrest rather than tachycardia or fibrillation. \nSKILL KEEPER: MAINTENANCE DOSE \nCALCULATIONS (SEE CHAPTER 3) \nDigoxin has a naffow therapeutic window, and its dosing \nmust be carefully managed. The drug's minimum effective \nconcentration is about 1 ng/mL About 6096 is excreted in the \nurine; the rest is metabolized in the liver. The normal clear\u00ad\nance of digoxin is 7 Uh/70 kg; volume of distribution is 500 \nLnO kg; and bioavailability is 7096. If your 70-kg patient's \nrenal function is only 3096 of normal, what daily oral main\u00ad\ntenance dosage should be used to achieve a safe plasma \nconcentration of 7 ng/mL?The Skill Keeper Answer appears \nat the end of the chapter. \nTreatment of digitalis toxicity includes several steps, as follows. \n1. Correction of potassium or magnesium deficiency\u00ad\nCorrection of potassium deficiency (often caused by diuretic \nuse) is important in reducing chronic digitalis intoxication. \nMild toxicity may often be managed by omitting 1 or 2 doses \nof digitalis and giving oral or parenteral K\u2022 supplements. \nSevere acute intoxication (as in suicidal overdoses) usually \ncauses marked hypmcalemia and should not be treated with \nsupplemental potassium. \n2. Antiarrhythmic drugs--Antiarrhythmic drugs may be useful \nif increased automaticity is prominent and does not respond \nto normalization of serum potassium. Agents that do not \nseverdy impair cardiac contractility (eg, lidocaine or phe\u00ad\nnytoin) arc favored, but drugs such as propranolol have also \nbeen used successfully. Severe acute digitalis overdose usually \ncauses marked inhibition of all cardiac pacemakers, and an \nelectronic pacemaker may be required. Antiarrhythmic drugs \nare dangerous in such patients. \n3. Digoxin antibodies--Digoxin antibodies (Fab fragments; \nDigibind) are extremely effective and should always be used if \nother therapies appear to be failing. They are effective for poi\u00ad\nsoning with several cardiac glycosides in addition to digoxin \nand may save patients who would otherwise die. \nOTHER DRUGS USED IN HEART FAILURE \nThe other major agents used in heart failure include diuretics, \nACE inhibitors, P1-selective sytnpathomimetics, P blockers, phos\u00ad\nphodiesterase inhibitors, and vasodilators. CHAPTER 13 Drags Used in Heart Failure 117 \nA. Diuretics \nDiuretics are the first-line therapy for both systolic and diastolic \nfailure and are used in heart failure before digitalis and other drugs \nare considered. Furoacmide is a very useful agent for immediate \nreduction of the pulmonary congestion and severe edema associ\u00ad\nated with acute heart failure and for moderate or severe chronic \nfailure. Thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide are sometimes \nsufficient for mild chronic failure but loop agents arc usually pre\u00ad\nferred. Clinical studies suggest that, unlike other diuretics, spi\u00ad\nronolactone and eplerenone (aldosterone antagonist diuretics) \nhave significant long-term benefits and can reduce mortality in \nchronic failure. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, others) inhibit \nthe reabsorption of sodium as well as gluoose in the proximal \ntubule of the ncphron (sec Chapter 41). They have recently been \napproved for use in type 2 diabetes and have been shown to reduce \nthe risk of cardiovascular death as well as hospitalizations for heart \nfailure in nondiabetics as well as type 2 diabetics. Diuretics are \ndiscussed in Chapter 15. \nB. Angiotensin Antagonists \nThese agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality \nin chronic heart failure. Although they have no direct positive ino\u00ad\ntropic action, angiotensin antagonists reduce aldosterone secretion, \nsalt and water retention, and vascular resistance (sec Chapter 11). \nThey are now considered, along with diuretics, to be first-line \ndrugs for chronic heart failure. The ANG II receptor blockers \n(ARBs, cg, loaartan) appear to have the same benefits as ACE \ninhibitors (eg, captopril), although experience with ARBs is not \nas extensive. \nC. Beta,-Adrenoceptor Agonlsts \nDobutamine and dopamine are often useful in acute failure in \nwhich systolic function is markedly depressed (see Chapter 9). \nHowever, they are not appropriate for chronic failure because of \ntolerance, lack of oral efficacy, and significant arrhythmogenic \neffects. \nD. Beta-Adrenoceptor Antagonists \nSeveral P blockers (carvedilol, labetalol, metoprolol, see \nChapter 10) have been shown in long-term studies to slow pro\u00ad\ngression of chronic heart failure. This benefit of P blockers had \nlong been recognized in patients with hypertrophic cardiomy\u00ad\nopathy but has also been shown to occur in patients without \ncardiomyopathy. Nebivolol, a P blocker with vasodilator effects \napproved for the treatment of hypertension, is investigational in \nheart failure. Beta blockers are of no value in acute failure and may \nbe detrimental if systolic dysfunction is marked. \nE. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors \nMilrinone is the major representative of this infrequently used \ngroup. Theophylline (in the form of its salt, aminophylline) was \ncommonly used fur acute failure in the past. These drugs increase \ncyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by inhibiting its break\u00ad\ndown by phosphodiesterase and cause an increase in cardiac intracel\u00ad\nlular calcium similar to that produced by P-adrenoceptor agonists."

            "Text": "118 PART III Cardiovascular Drugs \nPhosphodiesterase inhibitors also cause vasodilation, which may be \nresponsible for a major part of their beneficial effect. At sufficiently \nhigh concentrations, these agents may increase the sensitivity of the \ncontractile protein system to calcium, but they also cause arrhyth\u00ad\nmias. These agents should not be used in chronic failure because \nthey have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality. \nF. Vasodllators \nV asodilator therapy with nittoprusside or nitroglycerin is often \nused for acute severe failure with congestion . The use of these \nvasodilator drugs is based on the reduction in cardiac size and \nimproved efficiency that can be achieved with proper adjustment \nof venous return (prdoad) and reduction of impedance to ventric\u00ad\nular ejection (afterload). Vasodilator therapy can be dramatically \neffective, especially in cases in which increased afterload is a major \nfactor in causing the failure (eg, continuing hypertension in an \nindividual who has just had a myocardial infarction). \nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide \n(BNP) are normally released from the cardiac atria and other tissues \nand plasma levels increase in heart failure. The plasma level ofBNP \nis sometimes used to gauge the severity of failure and monitor drug \nresponse. N eprilysin is the enzyme primarily responsible for inactivat\u00ad\ning the natriuretic peptides; it also inactivates angiotensin II, bradyki\u00ad\nnin, and several other peptides. Ncsiriti.dc is a commercial version \nof BNP and acts chiefly by causing vasodilation, although it does \nhave natriuretic effects as wdl. It is given only by N infusion for \nacute failure. Nesiritide has significant renal toxicity and renal \nfunction must be monitored. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor \nthat inhibits metabolism of BNP. It is approved in combination \nwith the ARB valsartan. Clinical studies suggest that this combi\u00ad\nnation agent prolongs life and reduces hospitalizations in severe \nheart failure. \nChronic heart failure sometimes responds favorably to oral \nvasodilators such as hydralazine or isosorbidc diniuatc (or both), \nand this combination has been shown to reduce mortality due to \nheart failure in African Americans. Calcium channel blockers (eg, \nverapamil) are of no value in heart failure. \nG. Nonpharmacologic Therapy \nA variety of surgical procedures to remove nonfunctional regions \nof damaged myocardium have been attempted with mixed results. \nResynchronization of right and left ventricular contraction by \nmeans of a pacemaker has been beneficial in patients with long \nQRS (indicating conduction abnormalities). Insertion of an intra\u00ad\naortic pump is sometimes life-saving for patients with a massive \nmyocardial infarction and acute heart failure. Patients with coro\u00ad\nnary artery disease and heart failure may have improved systolic \nfunction after coronary revascularization. Transplantation of a \ndonor heart provides a long-term solution in a very small number \nof cases. QUESTIONS \nQuestions 1-2. A 73-year-old man with an inadequate response \nto other drugs is to receive digoxin for chronic heart failure. He \nis in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 88 bpm and blood \npressure of 135/85 mm Hg. \n1.

After your patient has been receiving digoxin for 3 weeks, he \npresents to the emergency department with an arrhythmia. \nWhich one of the following is most likely to contribute to the \narrhythmogenic effect of digoxin? \n(A) Increased parasympathetic discharge \n(B) Increased intracellular calcium \n(C) Decreased sympathetic discharge \n(D) Decreased intracellular ATP \n(E) Increased extracellular potassium \n3. A patient who has been taking digoxin for several years for \natrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure is about to receive \natropine for another condition.

Digitalis does not decrease calcium uptake by the sarcoplas\u00ad\nmic reticulum or increase sodium current; it does not modify \nactin. Cardiac adrenoceptors are not affected. The most accu\u00ad\nrate description of digitalis's mechanism in this list is that it \nincreases systolic cytoplasmic calcium by inhibiting Na+/K+ \ntransport by the ATPase sodium pump and indirectly altering \nNa+/ca2+ exchange. The answer is D. \n2. The effects of digitalis include increased vagal action on \nthe heart (not arrhythmogenic) and increased intracellular \ncalcium, including calcium overload, the most important \ncause of toxicity. Decreased sympathetic discharge and \nincreased extracdlular potassium and magnesium reduce digi\u00ad\ntalis arrhythmogenesis. The answer is B. \n3. The parasympathomimetic effects of digitalis can be \nblocked by muscarinic blockers such as atropine. The only CHAPTER 13 Drags Used in Heart Failure 119 \nparasympathomimetic effect in the list provided is increased \nPR interval, a manifestation of slowed AV conduction. The \nanswer is D. \n4, Chronic congestive failure with hypertension often benefits \nfrom a vasodilator that reduces blood pressure and venous \npressure. Hydralazine effectivdy reduces arterial pressure (see \nChapter 11) and isosorbide dinitrate is an effective venodila\u00ad\ntor (see Chapter 12). This combination has been shown to \nreduce hospitalizations in African Americans with heart fail\u00ad\nure. The answer is C. \n5. Of the drugs listed, only spironolactone has been shown to \nreduce mortality in this highly lethal disease. Digoxin, furose\u00ad\nmide, and nitroprusside are used in the management of symp\u00ad\ntoms. The answer is E. \n6. Furosemide has no significant effect on peptide metabolism \nand does not block AT 1 receptors. Losartan blocks AT 1 recep\u00ad\ntors but has no effect on peptide metabolism. Nesiritide is a \nsynthetic BNP and does not block AT 1 receptors. Spirono\u00ad\nlactone blocks the aldosterone receptor in the kidney. Only \nsacubitril/valsartan has the combined effect listed in the stem \nof this question. The answer is D. \n7. Although they are extremdy useful in heart failure, ACE \ninhibitors (eg, captopril, enalapril), and angiotensin receptor \nblockers (ARBs, eg, losartan) have no positive inotropic effect \non the heart. Nesiritide is a vasodilator with diuretic effects \nand renal toxicity. Dobutamine is a P1 -selective adrenoceptor \nagonist. The answer is B. \n8. In both acute and chronic failure and systolic (HFrEF) and \ndiastolic heart failure (HFpEF), the initial treatment of choice \nis usually furosemide. The answer is H. \n9. Several ~ blockers, including carvedilol, have been shown to \nprolong life in heart failure patients even though these drugs \nmay have a negative inotropic action on the heart. Their ben\u00ad\nefits presumably result from some other ~-mediated effect, \nand at least one other P blocker has failed to show a mortality \nbenefit. The answer is A. \n10. The drug of choice in severe, massive overdose with any \ncardiac glycoside is digoxin antibody, Digibind. The other \ndrugs listed are used in moderate overdosage associated with \nincreased automaticity.

            "Text": "C H A P T E R \nAntiarrhythntic Drugs \nCardiac arrhythmias are the most common cause of death in \npatients with a myocardial infarction or terminal heart failure. \nThey increase in prevalence in the elderly and atrial fibrilla\u00ad\ntion is particularly common in this group. Arrhythmias are \nalso the most serious manifestation of digitalis toxicity and are \noften associated with anesthetic procedures, hyperthyroidism, \nand electrolyte disorders. The drugs used for arrhythmias fall into five major groups or classes, but most have very low thera\u00ad\npeutic indices and when feasible, nondrug therapies (cardiover\u00ad\nsion, pacemakers, ablation, implanted defibrillators) are used. \nIn addition, conditions associated with certain arrhythmias, \nespecially increased risk of thromboembolism in atrial fibrilla\u00ad\ntion, must be treated with appropriate drugs from other groups \n(eg, anticoagulants). \nDrugs used In cardiac arrhythmias \nI J \nGroup 1 \nSodium \nchannel \nblockers \n(procalnamlde) Group 2 \nIi blockers \n(esmolol) Group3 \nPotassium \nchannel blockers \n(amlodarone, \ndofetllde) Group 4 \nCalcium \nchannel \nblockers \n(verapamll) Group 5 \nMiscellaneous \ngroup \n(adenosine, \nK+, Mg2+) \nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nA. Nature of Arrhythmias \nNormal electrical cardiac function (normal sinus rhythm, NSR) \nis dependent on generation of an impulse in the normal sinoatrial \n(SA) node pacemaker and its conduction through the atrial muscle, \nthrough the atrioventricular (AV) node, through the Purkinje con\u00ad\nduction system, to the ventricular muscle (Figure 14-1) where it is \nfinally extinguished after activating all the myocytes. A new impulse \nmust arise in the SA node for the next conducted action potential. \nNormal pacemaking and conduction require normal action poten\u00ad\ntials (dependent on sodium, calcium, and potassium channel activ\u00ad\nity) under appropriate autonomic control. Arrhythmias (also called \ndysrhythmias) are therefore deflned by exclusion, that is, an arrhyth\u00ad\nmia is any cardiac rhythm that is not normal sinus rhythm. \nAbnormal automaticity and abnormal conduction are the \ntwo major mechanisms for arrhythmias. Abnormalities of conduc\u00ad\ntion include reentrant conduction and less commonly, complete \nblock. A few of the clinically important arrhythmias are atrial \nflutter, atrial fibrillation (AFib), atrioventricular nodal reentry \n122 (a common type of aupraventricular tachycardia [SVT]), pre-\u00ad\nmature ventricular beats (PVBs), ventricular tachycardia (Vf), \nand ventricular fibrillation (VF). Examples of electrocardio\u00ad\ngraphic (ECG) recordings of normal sinus rhythm and some of \nthese common arrhythmias are shown in Figure 14-2. AFib is the \nmost common serious arrhythmia and, as noted above, is particu\u00ad\nlarly common in older patients. It is often symptomatic and may \ncontribute to worsening heart failure. Tonad.es de pointes is a \nventricular arrhythmia of great pharmacologic imponance because \nit is often induced by antiarrhythmic and other drugs that change \nthe shape of the action potential and prolong the QT interval. It \nhas the ECG morphology of a polymorphic ventricular tachycar\u00ad\ndia, often displaying waxing and waning QRS amplitude. Torsades \nis also associated with long QT syndrome, a heritable abnormal \nprolongation of the QT interval caused by mutations in certain IK \nor IN\u2022 channel proteins. \nB.

In \nmost parts of the heart, sodium channel current (IN.) dominates \nthe upstroke (phase 0) of the action potential (AP) and is the most \nimportant determinant of its conduction velocity. After a very brief \nactivation, most sodium channels enter a more prolonged period \nof inactivation. A small fraction of sodium channels inactivate \nmore slowly and may contribute to the long duration of Purkinje \nand ventricular action potentials. In the calcium-dependent AV \nnode, calcium current (le.), via L-type Ca2+ channels, dominates \nthe upstroke and the AP conduction velocity. The plateau of the \nAP (phase 2) is dominated by a depolarizing calcium current (le.) \nand several repolarizing potassium currents (collectively referred \nto as Irc). At the end of the plateau, IK causes rapid repolari:zation \n(phase 3). The refractory period of the sodium-dependent cardiac cells is \na function of how rapidly sodium channels recover from inactiva\u00ad\ntion. Recovery from inactivation depends on both the membrane \npotential, which varies with repolarization time and the extracellu\u00ad\nlar potassium concentration, and on the actions of drugs that bind \nto the sodium channel (ie, sodium channel blockers). Similarly, \nin the calcium-dependent AV node, the duration of refractoriness \nis dependent on the rate of recovery from inactivation of the cal\u00ad\ncium channels. The carrier processes (sodium pump and sodium\u00ad\ncalcium exchanger) contribute little to the shape of the AP, but \nthey are critical for the maintenance of the ion gradients on which \nthe sodium, calcium, and potassium currents depend. Most antiar\u00ad\nrhythmic drugs act on one or more of the three major currents (I Na\u2022 \nlea, Irc) or on the P adrenoceptors that modulate these currents. \nC. Drug Classification \nThe antiarrhythmic agents are usually classified using a system \nloosely based on the channel or receptor involved. As indicated \nby the overview figure on the first page of this chapter, this system \nspecifies four groups or classes, usually denoted by the numerals \n1 through 4, plus a miscellaneous group (see also Table 14-1 and \nDrug Summary Table). \n1. Sodium channd blockers \n2. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers \n3. Potassium channel blockers \n4. Calcium channel blockers \nThe miscellaneous group includes adenosine, potassium ion, \nand magnesium ion. \nD. Other Drugs \nBecause stroke and pulmonary embolism are common complica\u00ad\ntions of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulants are very important in the \ntreatment of patients with this arrhythmia. These drugs are dis\u00ad\ncussed in Chapter 34. \nGROUP 1 ANTIARRHYTHMICS {SODIUM \nCHANNEL BLOCKERS) \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Action \nThe group 1 drugs have local anesthetic actions and slow the \nupstroke of sodium-dependent action potentials and usually pro\u00ad\nlong QRS duration. They are further subdivided on the basis of \ntheir effects on AP duration (Figure 14-4). Group IA agents (pro\u00ad\ntotype procainamide) prolong the AP. Group 1 B drugs (proto\u00ad\ntype lidocaine) shorten the AP in some cardiac tissues, especially \nPurkinje fibers. Group 1 C drugs (prototype flecainide) have no \neffect on AP duration. \nAll group 1 drugs slow conduction in ischemic and depolar\u00ad\nized cells and slow or abolish abnormal pacemakers wherever these \nprocesses depend on sodium channels. The most selective agents \n(those in group lB) have significant effects on sodium channels \nin depressed ischemic tissue, but negligible effects on channels in \nnormal cells.

The deflections of the AP, \ndesignated as phases 0-3, are generated by several ionic currents. The actions of the sodium pump and sodium-<:alcium exchanger are mainly \ninvolved in maintaining ionic steady state during repetitive activity. Note that small but significant currents occur during diastole (phase 4) in \naddition to the pump and exchanger activity. In non-pacemaker cells, the outward potassium current during phase 4 ls sufficient to maintain a \nstable negative resting potential as shown by the solid line at the right end of the tracing. In pacemaker cells, however, the potassium current is \nsmaller and the depolarizing currents (sodium, calcium, or both) during phase 4 are large enough to gradually depolarize the cell during diastole \n(dashed line).

Procainamide i& also commonly used \nin arrhythmias during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. \nProcairuun.ide may cawe hypotension and chronic use may \ncause a reversible syndrome similar to lupus eryth.e.matosus. Quin\u00ad\nidine (the optical isomer of quinine) cause& dncbonism. (head\u00ad\nache. vertigo, tinnitus); cardiac depression; gastrointestinal upset; \nand autoimmune reactions (eg, thrombocytopenic pw-pura).

Flecainide and its congeners are more likdy than \nother antiarrhythmic drugs to exacerbate or precipitate arrhyth\u00ad\nmias (proarrhythmic effect). This toxicity was dramatically dem\u00ad\nonstrated by the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST}, \na large clinical trial of the prophylactic use of group 1 C drugs \nin myocardial infarction survivors. The trial results showed that \ngroup lC drugs caused greater mortality than placebo. For this \nreason, the group 1 C drugs are now restricted to use in persis\u00ad\ntent arrhythmias that fail to respond to other drugs. Group 1 C \ndrugs also cause local anesthetic-like CNS toxicity. Hyperkalemia \nincreases the cardiac toxicity of these agents. \nGROUP 2 ANTIARRHYTHMICS (BETA \nBLOCKERS) \nA. Prototypes, Mechanisms, and Effeds \nBeta blockers are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10. \nPropranolol and csmolol are prototypic antiarrhythmic P blockers. \nTheir mechanism in arrhythmias is primarily cardiac P-adrenoceptor \nblockade and reduction in cAMP, which results in a modest reduc\u00ad\ntion of both sodium and calcium currents and the suppression of \nabnormal pacemakers. The AV node is particularly sensitive to \np blockers and the PR interval is usually prolonged by group 2 drugs \n(Table 14-1). Under some conditions, these drugs may have some \ndirect local anesthetic (sodium channel-blocking) effect in the heart, \nbut this is rare at the concentrations usually achieved clinically. \nSotalol and amioclarone, generally classified as group 3 drugs, also \nhave group 2 P-blocking effects. \nB. Clinical Uses and Toxicities \nEsmolol, a very shon-acting p blocker for intravenous administra\u00ad\ntion, is used exclusively in acute arrhythmias. Propranolol, meto\u00ad\nprolol, and timolol are commonly used chronically to prevent \narrhythmias in patients who have had a myocardial infarction. \nSKILL KEEPER: CHARACTERISTICS OF \n~ BLOCKERS (SEE CHAPTER 10) \nDescribe the important subgroups of~ blockers and their \nmajor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. The \nSkill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nThe toxicities of p blockers are the same in patients with \narrhythmias as in patients with other conditions (see Chapter 10 \nand Drug Summary Table}. While patients with arrhythmias are \noften more prone to P-blocker-induced depression of cardiac out\u00ad\nput than are patients with normal hearts, it should be noted that \njudicious use of these drugs reduces progression of chronic heart \nfailure (see Chapter 13) and reduces the incidence of potentially \nfatal arrhythmias in this condition. CHAPTER 14 Antiarrhythmic Drugs 127 \nGROUP 3 ANTIARRHYTHMICS \n(POTASSIUM IK CHANNEL BLOCKERS) \nA. Prototypes, Mechanisms, and Effeds \nDofetilide and ibutilide are typical group 3 drugs. Sotalol is a \nchiral compound (ie, it has two optical isomers}. One isomer is \nan effective p blocker, and both isomers contribute to the antiar\u00ad\nrhythmic action through K-channd block The clinical prepara\u00ad\ntion contains both isomers. Amiodarone is usually classified as a \ngroup 3 drug because it blocks the same K channels and markedly \nprolongs AP duration as well as blocking other channels and ~ \nreceptors. Dronedarone is similar to amiodarone but less effica\u00ad\ncious and less toxic. \nThe hallmark of group 3 drugs is prolongation of the AP \nduration. This AP prolongation is caused by blockade of the IK \npotassium channels, chiefly IKr, that are responsible fur the repo\u00ad\nlarization of the AP (Figure 14-5). AP prolongation results in an \nincrease in effective refractory period and reduces the ability of the \nhean to respond to rapid tachycardias or fibrillation. Sotalol, ibu\u00ad\ntilide, dofetilide, and amiodarone (and group IA drugs; see prior \ndiscussion} produce this effect on most cardiac cells; the action of \nthese drugs is therefore apparent in the ECG mainly as an increase \nin QT interval (Table 14-1). \nB. Cllnlcal Uses and Toxicities \nSee the Drug Summary Table. Because of the high prevalence of \nAFib and their modest efficacy in this arrhythmia, group 3 drugs \nare in common use. AFib is also the arrhythmia most often treated \nwith percutaneous ablation because this therapy, unlike pharma~ \ncologic treatment, offers the possibility of a cure. \n--85 mV \nOutside \nMembrane \nInside ~ K1 Na Ca \nAction potential currents Diastolic currents \nFIGURE 14-5 Schematic diagram of the effects of group 3 \nagents.

Because \nof its toxicities, however, amiodarone is approved for use mainly \nin arrhythmias that are resistant to other drugs. Nevertheless, it is \nused very extensively, off label, in a wide variety of arrhythmias \nbecause of its superior efficacy. \nAmiodarone causes microcrystalline deposits in the oornea and \nskin, thyroid dysfunction (hyper-or hypothyroidism), paresthe\u00ad\nsias, tremor, and pulmonary fibrosis. Amiodarone rarely causes \nnew arrhythmias, perhaps because it blocks calcium channels and \n~ receptors as well as sodium and potassium channels. Dronedarone, \nan amiodarone analog, is also approved. Like amiodarone, it acts \non sodium, potassium, and calciwn channels, but at present it is \napproved only for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or flutter. \nDronedarone does not appear to be as efficacious as amiodarone \nbut may be less toxic. \nGROUP 4 ANTIARRHYTHMICS (CALCIUM \nL-TYPE CHANNEL BLOCKERS) \nA. Prototypes, Mechanisms, and Effects \nVerapamil is the prototype. Diltiazem is also an effective antiar\u00ad\nrhythmic drug. Nifedipine and the other dihydropycidines are not \nuseful as antiarrhythmics, probably because they decrease arterial \npressure enough to evoke a compensatory sympathetic discharge \nto the heart. The latter effect facilitates arrhythmias. Verapamil and diltiazem are effective in arrhythmias that must \ntraverse calciwn-dependent cardiac tissue such as the AV node. \nThese agents cause a state-and use-dependent selective depres\u00ad\nsion of calcium current (Figure 14-6). AV conduction velocity \nis decreased, and effective refractory period and PR interval are \nincreased by these drugs (Table 14-1). \nB. Cllnlcal Use and Toxicities \nCalcium channel blockers are effective for converting AV nodal reen\u00ad\ntry (also known as nodal tachycardia) to normal sinus rhythm. Their \nmajor use is in the prevention of these nodal arrhythmias in patients \nprone to recurrence. These drugs are available for oral and parenteral \nuse {see Drug Summary Table). The most important toxicity of these \ndrugs is excessive depression of cardiac contractility, AV conduction, \nand blood pressure. These agents should be avoided in ventricular \ntachycardias. See Chapter 12 for additional discussion of toxicity. \nAmiodarone has moderate calcium channel-blocking activity. \nMISCELLANEOUS ANTIARRHYTHMIC \nDRUGS \nA. Adenoslne \nAdenosine is a normal component of the body, but when given \nin high doses (6-12 mg) as an intravenous bolus, the drug mark\u00ad\nedly slows or completely blocks conduction in the atrioventric\u00ad\nular node (Table 14-1), probably by hyperpolarizing this tissue \n(through increased Ir<) and by reducing calcium current. Adenos\u00ad\nine is extremely effective in abolishing AV nodal arrhythmia, and \nbecause of its very low toxicity it has become the drug of choice \nPhase 2 (lea and It<) \nPhaseO \nNote-Q;J \n-75mV \nOutside \nMembrane \nInside ERP \nGroup 4 action \n~ \nK \nAction potential currents K Na Ca \nDiastolic currents \nFIGURE 14-6 Schematic diagram of the effects of group 4 drugs in a calcium-dependent cardiac cell in the AV node (note that the AP \nupstroke in this figure is due mainly to calcium current).

            "Text": "for this arrhythmia. Adenosine has an cxtremdy short duration of \naction (about 15 s). Toxicity includes flushing and hypotension, \nbut because of their short duration these effects do not limit the \nuse of the drug. Transient chest pain and dyspnea (probably due \nto bronchoconstriction) may also occur. \nB. Potassium Ion \nPotassium depresses ectopic pacemakers, including those caused \nby digitalis toxicity. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased \nincidence of arrhythmias, especially in patients receiving digitalis. \nConversely, excessive potassium levels depress conduction and can \ncause reentry arrhythmias. Therefore, when treating arrhythmias, \nserum potassium should be measured and normalized if abnormal. \nC. Magnesium Ion \nAbnormalities of magnesium concentration do not occur as fre\u00ad\nquently as hyper-or hypokalemia. Intravenous administration of \nmagnesium appears to have similar depressant effects as potassium \non digitalis-induced arrhythmias.

A drug was tested in the electrophysiology laboratory to \ndetermine its effects on the cardiac action potential in normal \nventricular cells. The results are shown in the diagram. \nWhich of the following drugs docs this agent most resemble? \n(A) Amiodarone \n(B) Flecainide \n(C) Mexiletine \n(D) Procainamide \n(E) Verapamil ANSWERS \n1. Hyperkalemia facilitates procainamide toxicity. Procainamide is \nactive by the oral route and has a duration of action of 2-4 h \n(in the prompt-release form). Procainamide has no signifi\u00ad\ncant documented interaction with digox.in and no significant \nP..agonist or P..blocking action. The answer is B. \n2. The most effective therapy for procainamide (and quinidine) \ntoxicity appears to be concentrated sodium lactate. This drug \nmay (1) increase sodium current by increasing the sodium ion \ngradient and (2) reduce drug-receptor binding by alkalinizing \nthe tissue. The answer is E. \n3. Amiodarone typically decreases contractility only slightly; it \nprolongs the PR and QRS interval, as well as the QT inter\u00ad\nval and action potential duration; and it has no effect on the \nresting potential. Its major toxicity is pulmonary fibrosis, not \nliver toxicity. The answer is B. \n4. This patient is suffering from a typical perisurgical arrhyth\u00ad\nmia, exacerbated by her thyroid disorder. Beta blockers are the \nmost effective agents in acute thyrotoxic arrhythmias. While P blockers are used to decrease blood pressure in hyperten\u00ad\nsion, this patient's lowered blood pressure is probably due to \nthe arrhythmia and will normalize when the tachycardia is \nconverted to normal sinus rhythm. Esmolol is a parenteral, \nrapid-acting ~ blocker (see Chapter 10). The answer is C. \n5. Calcium channel blockers are effective in both treating and \npreventing supraventricular AV nodal tachycardias. They are \norally active and have a duration of action of several hours. \nAdenosine is very effective in most acute nodal tachycardias \nand is less toxic because of its extremely short duration of \naction. However, it is not useful for chronic prophylaxis \nbecause it must be given IV and has a very short duration of \naction. The answer is E. \n6. All the associations listed are incorrect except flecainide (see \nTable 14-1). Group 1C drugs block sodium channels but have \nlittle effect on K\u2022 and ea2\u2022 channels. The answer is B. \n7. Lldocaine has limited applications as an antiarrhythmic drug, \nbut emergency treatment of myocardial infarction arrhyth\u00ad\nmias is one of the most important. Procainamide or amioda\u00ad\nrone are used as alternative drugs in this situation. Lidocaine \nis also useful in digoxin-induced arrhythmias. After recovery \nfrom the acute phase of a myocardial infarction, P blockers \nare used for 2 years or more to prevent sudden death arrhyth\u00ad\nmias. The answer is C. \n8. Adenosine is a very short-acting parenteral agent often used \nfor AV nodal arrhythmias. Diltiazem also slows AV conduc\u00ad\ntion and aborts AV nodal arrhythmias but has a duration of \nhours, not seconds. (Beta blockers also slow AV conduction \nbut have much smaller effects on calcium channels and dura\u00ad\ntions of action of hours.) The answer is A \n9. Amiodarone has the longest half-life of all the antiarrhyth\u00ad\nmics (weeks). The answer is B. \n10. The drug effect shown in the diagram includes slowing of the \nupstroke of the AP but no significant change in repolarization \nor AP duration. This is most typical of group 1 C drugs. The \nanswer is B, flecainide. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The major \ntransport mechanisms for the recovery of ions and water in the vari\u00ad\nous segments of the nephron are shown in Figure 15-1. Because the \nmechanisms for reabsorption of salt and water differ in each of the four \nmajor tubular segments, the diuretics acting in these segments have \ndiffering mechanisms of action.

An exception is the aldosterone receptor \n134 ADH \nI ,~_.agonists ~ pressin) \nADH \nantagonists \n(conivaptan) \nantagonist group (spironolactone and eplerenone); these drugs enter \nthe collecting tubule cell from the basolateral side and bind to the \ncytoplasmic aldosterone receptor. The kidney contains numerous ade\u00ad\nnosine and prostaglandin receptors. Agonists and antagonists at these \nreceptors can alter renal function directly and also alter the response \nto the diuretic agents. Prostaglandins are important in maintaining \nglomerular filtration. When synthesis of prostaglandins is inhibited, \nfor example, by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs {NSAIDs, see \nChapter 36), the efficacy of most diuretics decreases. During preg\u00ad\nnancy, the fetal kidney is chiefly responsible for amniotic fluid pro\u00ad\nduction after the 20th week; NSAIDs should not be used in pregnant \nwomen after this time whether or not they are receiving a diuretic. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

New York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2021.) \nPROXIMAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE \nThis segment carries out isosmotic reabsorption of amino acids, glu\u00ad\ncose, and numerous ions. It is the major site for sodium, chloride, \nand bicarbonate reabsorption. The proximal tubule is responsible \nfor 60-70% of the total reabsorption of sodium. No currently avail\u00ad\nable drug directly acts on NaCl reabsorption in the proximal convo\u00ad\nluted tubule (PCT). The mechanism for bicarbonate reabsorption is \nshown in Figure 15-2. Bicarbonate itself is poorly reabsorbed through \nthe luminal membrane, but conversion of bicarbonate to carbon \ndioxide via carbonic acid permits rapid reabsorption of the carbon \ndioxide. Bicarbonate can then be regenerated from carbon dioxide \nwithin the tubular cell and transported into the interstitium. Sodium \nis separatdy reabsorbed from the lumen in exchange for hydrogen \nions (NHE3 transporter) and transported into the interstitial space by the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/\u00a5: ATPase). Carbonic anhy\u00ad\ndrase, the enzyme requited for the bicarbonate reabsorption process \non the brush border and in the cytoplasm, is the target of carbonic \nanhydrase inhibitor drugs. Active secretion and reabsorption of weak \nacids and bases also occur in the proximal tubule. Most weak acid \ntransport occurs in the straight S2 segment, distal to the convoluted \npart. Uric acid transport is especially important and is targeted by \nsome of the drugs used in treating gout (see Chaptet 36). Weak bases \nare transported in the S1 and S2 segments. A sodium-glucose cotrans\u00ad\nporter (SGLT2) is responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the \nproximal tubule, and inhibitors are now available that inhibit this \ntransporter and reduce blood sugar in diabetics. \nCARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Adion \nAcetuolamide is the prototypic agent. These diuretics are sulfon\u00ad\namide derivatives. The mechanism of action is inhibition of car\u00ad\nbonic anhydrase in the brush border and cytoplasm (Figure 15-2). \nCarbonic anhydrase is also found in other tissues and plays an \nimportant role in the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid and aqueous \nhumor. Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase in all tissues of \nthe body. \nB. Effeds \nThe major renal effect is bicarbonate diuresis (ie, sodium bicar\u00ad\nbonate is excreted in large amounts); body bicarbonate is depleted, \nand metabolic acidosis results. As increased sodium is presented \nto the cortical collecting tubule, some of the excess sodium is \nreabsorbed and potassium is secreted, resulting in significant \npotassium wasting (Table 15-1). As a result of bicarbonate deple\u00ad\ntion, sodium bicarbonate excretion slows-even with continued \ndiuretic administration-and the diuresis is self-limiting within \n2-3 days. Secretion of bicarbonate into aqueous humor by the \nciliary epithelium in the eye and into the cerebrospinal fluid by \nthe choroid plexus is reduced. In the eye, a useful reduction in \nintraocular pressure can be achieved. In the central nervous system \n(CNS), acidosis of the cerebrospinal fluid results in hyperventila\u00ad\ntion, which can protect against high-altitude sickness. The ocular \nand cecebrospinal fluid effects are not self-limiting. \nTABLE 15-1 Eledrolyte changes produced by diuretic drugs. \nAmount In Urine \nGroup NaCl NaHC0 3 I( Body pH \nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors t' ttt' t\u00b7 Acidosisb \nLoop diuretics tttt t Alkalosis \nThiazides tt t- t Alkalosis \nl<-sparing diuretics t J.

Clinical Uses and Toxicity \nAcetazolamide is used parenterally in the treatment of severe acute \nglaucoma (see Table 10-2). Acetazolamide can also be admin\u00ad\nistered orally, but topical analogs are available (don.ola.midc, \nbrinzolamide) for chronic use in the eye. Acetazolamide is also \nused to prevent acute mountain (high-altitude) sickness. It is used \nfor its diuretic effect only if edema is accompanied by significant \nmetabolic alkalosis. \nDrowsiness and paresthesia toxicities are commonly reported \nafter oral therapy. Cross-allergenicity between these and all other \nsulfonamide derivatives (other sulfonamide diuretics, hypogly\u00ad\ncemic agents, antibacterial sulfonamides) is uncommon but can \noccur. Alkalinization of the urine by these drugs may cause pre\u00ad\ncipitation of calcium salts and formation of renal stones. Renal \npotassium wasting may be marked until the diuresis self-limits. \nPatients with hepatic impairment often excrete large amounts of \nammonia in the urine in the form of ammonium ion. If they are \ngiven acetazolamide, alkalinization of the urine prevents conver\u00ad\nsion of ammonia to ammonium ion. As a result, they may develop \nhepatic encephalopathy because of increased ammonia reabsorp\u00ad\ntion and byperammonentla. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may \nalso cause phosphate wasting. \nTHICK ASCENDING LIMB OF THE LOOP \nOF HENLE \nThis segment pumps sodium, potassium, and chloride out of the \nlumen into the interstitium of the kidney. It is also a major site of \ncalcium and magnesium reabsorption, as shown in Figure 15-3. \nLumen\u00ad\nurine Thick \nascending \nlimb \ni<+-+---1+ \n2C1-\u00b7-~'\"\"\"\u00b7 lnterstltlurn\u00ad\nblood \nFIGURE 15-3 Mechanism of sodium, potassium, and chloride \nreabsorptlon by the transporter NKCQ In the thick ascending llmb of \nthe loop of Henle. Note that pumping of potassium into the cell from \nboth the lumen and the interstitium would result in unphysiologically \nhigh intracellular I<' concentration. This is avoided by movement of \nI<' down its concentration gradient back into the I um en, carrying \nwith it excess positive charge. This positive charge drives the reab\u00ad\nsorption of calcium and magnesium. (Reproduced with permission \nfrom Katzung BG, Vanderah TW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, \n15th ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2021 .) Reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride are all accom\u00ad\nplished by a Na+/K+12cr carrier (NKCC2), which is the target of \nthe loop diuretics. This cotransporter provides part of the con\u00ad\ncentration gradient for the countercurrent concentrating mecha\u00ad\nnism in the kidney and is responsible for the reabsorption of \n20-30% of the sodium filtered at the glomerulus. Because potas\u00ad\nsium is pumped into the cell from both the lurninal and basal \nsides, an escape route must be provided; this occurs into the lumen \nvia a potassium-selective channel. Because the potassium diffus\u00ad\ning through these channels is not accompanied by an anion, a net \npositive charge is set up in the lumen. This positive potential facili\u00ad\ntates the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium. \nLOOP DIURETICS \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Adlon \nFurosemid.e is the prototypical loop agent. Furosemide, \nbumet.anide, and tonemide are sulfonamide derivatives. Ethac\u00ad\nrynic acid is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative; it is not a sulfonamide \nbut acts by the same mechanism. Loop diuretics inhibit the cotrans\u00ad\nport of sodium, potassium, and chloride (NKCC2, Figure 15-3). \nThe loop diuretics are rdativdy short-acting (diuresis usually \noccurs over a 4-h period following a dose). \nB. Effeds \nA full dose of a loop diuretic produces a massive sodium chloride \ndiuresis if glomerular filtration is normal; blood volume may be \nsignificantly reduced. If tissue perfusion is adequate, edema fluid \nis rapidly excreted. The diluting ability of the nephron is reduced \nbecause the loop of Henle is the site of significant dilution of urine. \nInhibition of the Na\u00b71~12cr transporter also results in loss of \nthe lumen-positive potential, which reduces reabsorption of diva\u00ad\nlent cations as wdl. As a result, calcium excretion is significantly \nincreased. Ethacrynic acid is a moderately effective uricosuric drug \nif blood volume is maintained. The presentation of large amounts \nof sodium to the collecting tubule may result in significant potas\u00ad\nsium wasting and excretion of protons; hypokalemic alkalosis may \nresult (Table 15-1). Loop diuretics also reduce pulmonary vascu\u00ad\nlar pressures; the mechanism is not known. \nC. Clinical Use and Toxicities \nThe major application of loop diuretics is in the treatment of \nedematous states (eg, heart failure, ascites, and acute pulmonary \nedema). They are sometimes used in hypertension if response to \nthiazides is inadequate , but the short duration of action of loop \ndiuretics is a disadvantage in this condition. A less common hut \nimportant application is in the treatment of severe hypercalcemia. \nThis life-threatening condition can often be managed with large \ndoses of furosemide together with parenteral volume and dectro\u00ad\nlyte (sodium and potassium chloride) replacement. It should be \nnoted that diuresis without volume replacement results in hemo\u00ad\nconcentration; serum calcium concentration then will not dimin\u00ad\nish and may even increase further. \nLoop diuretics usually induce hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis \n(Table 15-1).

Because \nthey arc so efficacious, loop diuretics can cause hypovolcmia and \ncardiovascular complications. Ototoxicity is an important toxic \neffect of the loop agents. The sulfonamides in this group may \nrardy cause typical sulfonamide allergy, for example, rash. \nDISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE \nThis segment activdy pumps sodium and chloride out of the \nlumen of the ncphron via the Na\u20221cr carrier (NCC) shown \nin Figure 15-4. This cotransporter is the target of the thiazide \ndiuretics. The distal convoluted tubule (DCl) is responsible for \n5-8% of filtered sodium reabsorption. Calcium is also reabsorbed \nin this segment under the control of parathyroid hormone (PTH). \nRemoval of the reabsorbed calcium back into the blood requires \nthe sodium-calcium exchange process discussed in Chapter 13. \nTHIAZIDE DIURETICS \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Adion \nHydrochlorothiazide, the prototypical agent, and all the other \nmembers of this group are sulfonamide derivatives.

(Reproduced with permission from \nKatzung BG, Vanderah TW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15th ed. \nNew York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2021.) considered thiazide-like. The major action of thiazides is to inhibit \nsodium chloride transport in the early segment of the distal convo\u00ad\nluted tubule (NCC, Figure 15-4). Thiazides are active by the oral \nroute and have a duration of action of 6-12 h, considerably lon\u00ad\nger than most loop diuretics. Chlorothiazidc is the only thiazide \navailable for parenteral use. \nB. Effeds \nIn full doses, thiazides produce moderate but sustained sodium \nand chloride diuresis. Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis may occur \n(Table 15-1). Reduction in the transport of sodium from the \nlumen into the tubular cdl reduces intracdlular sodium and pro\u00ad\nmotes sodium-calcium exchange at the basolateral membrane. As \na result, reabsorption of calcium from the urine is increased, and \nurine calcium content is decreased-the opposite of the effect of \nloop diuretics. Because they act in a diluting segment of the neph\u00ad\nron, thiazides may reduce the excretion of water and cause dilu\u00ad\ntional hyponatrcmia. Thiazides also reduce blood pressure, and \nthe maximal pressure-lowering effect occurs at doses lower than \nthe maximal diuretic doses (see Chapter 11). Chlorthaliclone is \nlonger acting than hydrochlorothiazide and may be particularly \nvaluable in hypertension. Inhibition of renal prostaglandin syn\u00ad\nthesis reduces the efficacy of the thiazides. When a thiazide is \nused with a loop diuretic, a synergistic effect occurs with marked \ndiuresis. \nC. Clinical Use and Toxicities \nThe major application of thiazides is in hypertension, for which \ntheir long duration and moderate intensity of action are partic\u00ad\nularly useful. Chronic therapy of edematous conditions such as \nmild heart failure is another application, although loop diuretics \nare usually preferred. Chronic renal calcium stone formation can \nsometimes be controlled with thiazides because they reduce urine \ncalcium concentration. Thiazides are also used in the treatment of \nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus. \nMassive sodium diuresis with hyponatremia is an uncommon \nbut dangerous early toxicity of thiazides. Chronic therapy is often \nassociated with potassium wasting, since an increased sodium load \nis presented to the collecting tubules; the cortical collecting tubules \ncompensate by reabsorbing sodium and excreting potassium. Dia~ \nbetic patients may have significant hyperglycemia. Serum uric acid \nand lipid levds are also increased in some persons. Combination \nwith loop agents may result in rapid development of severe hypo\u00ad\nvolemia and cardiovascular collapse. Thiazides are sulfonamides \nand share potential sulfonamide allergenicity. \nCORTICAL COLLECTING TUBULE \nThe final segment of the nephron is the last tubular site of sodium \nreabsorption; this is regulated by aldosterone (Figure 15-5), a \nsteroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. This segment \nis responsible for reabsorbing 2-5% of the total filtered sodium \nunder normal circumstances; more if aldostcrone is increased. \nThe reabsorption of sodium occurs via epithelial sodium ion \nchannels (ENaC), not a transporter, and is accompanied by loss \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Prototypes and Mechanism of Action \nSpironolactone and eplerenone are steroid derivatives and act as \npharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone in the collecting tubules. \nBy binding and blocking the intracellular aldosterone receptor, \nthese drugs reduce the expression of genes that code for the ENaC \nand Na+/K+ ATPase. Amiloride and triamtercne act by block\u00ad\ning the ENaC sodium channels (Figure 15-5). (These drugs do \nnot block INa channels in excitable membranes.) Spironolactone \nand eplerenone have slow onsets and offsets of action (24-72 h). \nAmiloride and triamterene have durations of action of 12-24 h. \nB. Effects \nAll drugs in this class cause an increase in sodium clearance and a \ndecrease in potassium and hydrogen ion excretion and therefore \nqualify as potassium-sparing diuretics. They may cause hyperkale\u00ad\nmic metabolic acidosis (Table 15-1). C. Clinical Uses and Toxicities \nPotassium wasting caused by chronic therapy with loop or thiazide \ndiuretics, if not controlled by dietary potassium supplements, usu\u00ad\nally responds to these drugs. They are also available in combina\u00ad\ntion with a thiazide in a single pill. \nAldosteronism {eg, the elevated serum aldosterone levels that \noccur in cirrhosis) is an important indication for spironolactone. \nAldosteronism is also a feature of heart failure, and spironolactone \nand eplerenone have been shown to have significant long-term \nbenefits in this condition (see Chapter 13). Some of this poorly \nunderstood effect may occur in the heart. \nThe most important adverse effect of potassium-sparing diuret\u00ad\nics is hyperkalemia. These drugs should never be given with potas\u00ad\nsium supplements. Other aldosterone antagonists (cg, angiotensin \n[ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), if used \nat all, should be used with caution in patients taking potassium\u00ad\nsparing diuretics. Spironolactone can cause endocrine alterations \nincluding gynecomastia and antiandrogenic effects. Eplerenone \nhas less affinity for gonadal steroid receptors. \nSKILL KEEPER: DIGITALIS AND DIURETICS \n(SEE CHAPTER 13) \nDescribe the possible interactions of cardiac glycosides \n(digoxin) with the major classes of diuretics. The Skill Keeper \nAnswer appears at the end of the chapter. \nOSMOTIC DIURETICS \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Action \nManoitol, the prototypical osmotic diuretic, is given intrave\u00ad\nnously. Other drugs often classified with mannitol (but rardy \nused) include glycerin, isosorbide (not isosorbide dinitrate), and \nurea. Because they are freely filtered at the glomerulus but poorly \nreabsorbed from the tubule, they remain in the lumen and \"hold\" \nwater by virtue of their osmotic effect. The major location for this \naction is the proximal convoluted tubule. Reabsorption of water is \nalso reduced in the descending limb of the loop of Henle and the \ncollecting tubule. \nB. Effects \nThe volume of urine is increased. Most filtered solutes are excreted \nin larger amounts unless they are actively reabsorbed. Sodium \nexcretion is usually increased because the rate of urine flow through \nthe tubule is greatly accelerated and sodium transporters cannot \nhandle the volume rapidly enough. Mannitol can also reduce brain \nvolume and intracranial pressure by osmotically extracting water \nfrom the tissue into the blood. A similar effect occurs in the eye. \nC.

Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin \n(and ipraglillozin in Japan) arc SGLT2 inhibitors approved for \nthe treatment of diabetes. They reduce the active reabsorption of \nfiltered glucose in the proximal tubule and increase its excretion by \n30-50%.

High glucose concentration in the urine may result \nin urinary tract infections. \nANTI DIURETIC HORMONE AGONISTS & \nANTAGONISTS \nA. Prototypes and Mechanism of Action \nAntidiu.rctic hormone (ADH) and desmopressin are prototypical \nADH agonists. They are peptides and must be given parenterally. \nConivapta.n and tolvapta.n are ADH antagonists. Dcrneclocyclinc \nwas previously used as an antagonist. Lithium also has ADH\u00ad\nantagonist effects but is never used for this purpose. \nADH facilitates water reabsorption from the collecting tubule \nby activation of V2 receptors, which stimulate adcnylyl cyclase \nvia G,. The increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) \ncauses the insertion of additional aquaporin2 (AQP2) water \nchannels into the luminal membrane in this pan of the tubule \n(Figure 15-6). Conivaptan is an ADH inhibitor at Yi. and V2 \nreceptors. Tolvaptan is a more selective V2 blocker with little V1 \naffinity. Dcrneclocycline and lithium inhibit the action of ADH \nat some point distal to the generation of cAMP and presumably \ninterfere with the insertion of water channels into the membrane. \nB. Effects and Clinical Uses \n1.Agonists-ADH and desmopressin reduce urine volume and \nincrease its concentration. Thus, ADH and dc.unopressin are use\u00ad\nful in pituitary diabetes insipidus (insufficient ADH). They are \nof no value in the nephrogmic form of the disease (resistance to \nADH), but salt restriction, water restriction, tbiazi.des, and \nloop diuretics may be used. These therapies reduce blood volume, \na very strong stimulus to proximal tubular reabsorption. Increased \nwater reabsorption in the proximal tubule thus substitutes-in \npart-for the deficient concentrating function of the collecting \ntubule in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Although acetazolamide is rarely used in heart failure, car\u00ad\nbonic anhydrasc inhibitors arc quite valuable in patients with \nedema and metabolic alkalosis. The high bicarbonate levels \nin these patients make them particularly susceptible to the \naction of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. This patient has both \nhigh pH and bicarbonate. Digoxin is useful in chronic systolic \nfailure but is not first-line therapy and may cause vomiting, \nwith depletion of stomach acid and reduced serum chloride; \nincreasing the digoxin dose might cause arrhythmias. Tolvap\u00ad\ntan might be useful if the patient were hyponatremic. Hydro\u00ad\nchlorothiazide and eplerenone are not adequate for first-line \ntherapy of edema in acute heart failure. The answer is A \n2. The thiazides are useful in the prevention of calcium stones \nbecause these drugs reduce tubular calcium concentration, \nprobably by increasing passive proximal tubular and distal \nconvoluted tubule reabsorption of calcium. In contrast, the \nloop agents (choice C) facilitate calcium excretion. Diazoxide \nis a thiazide-like vasodilator drug but has no diuretic action; \nin fact, it may cause sodium retention. It is used in hyperten\u00ad\nsion and insulinoma (see Chapter 11). The answer is A \n3. Loop diuretics increase urinary calcium excretion and tkcrease \nblood pressure (in hypertension) and pulmonary vascular \npressure (in congestive heart failure). They have no recognized \nteratogenic action. They cause metabolic alkalosis (Table \n15-1). Loop diuretics also cause ototoxicity. The answer is D. \n4. Acetazolamide causes metabolic acidosis. Furosemide causes \na marked increase in sodium and a moderate increase in \npotassium excretion. Thiazides cause alkalosis and a greater \nincrease in sodium than potassium excretion. Mannitol causes \na small increase in both sodium and potassium excretion and \nno change in body pH. Spironolactone causes the changes \nindicated. The answer is D. \nS. An osmotic agent is needed to remove water from the cells of \nthe edematous brain and reduce intracranial pressure rapidly. \nThe answer is E. \n6. Diuretic therapy of hypercalcemia requires a reduction in cal\u00ad\ncium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb, an effect of \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: loop diuretics. However, a loop diuretic alone would reduce \nblood volume around the remaining calcium so that serum \ncalcium would not decrease appropriately. Therefore, a saline \ninfusion should accompany the loop diuretic. The answer is B. \n7. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with reduced blood vol\u00ad\nume, which may occur with excessive diuresis. The observa\u00ad\ntion that the patient also has hearing impairment suggests the \nuse of an ototoxic drug, eg, loop agent like furosemide. The \nanswer is C. \n8. Diabetes is associated with increased susceptibility to infec\u00ad\ntion. The fact that the patient has a normal blood glucose \nindicates that her medications are reducing blood glucose and, \ncombined with a urinary tract infection, further suggests that \nurine glucose is elevated. Increased glucose excretion in the \nurine is an effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors. The answer is B, \ndapagliflozin. \n9. Retention of water with hyponatremia and inability to form \ndilute urine in the fully hydrated condition is characteristic of \nSIADH. Antagonists of ADH are needed to treat this condi\u00ad\ntion. The answer is I, tolvaptan. \n10. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are useful for the prevention of \naltitude sickness. The answer is A \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: DIGITALIS AND \nDIURETICS (SEE CHAPTER 13) \nDigoxin toxicity is facilitated by hypokalemia. Therefore, \npotassium-wasting diuretics (eg, loop agents, thiozides), \nwhich are often needed in heart failure, can increase the risk \nof a fatal digitalis arrhythmia. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, \nthough also potassium-wast ing agents, are rarely used for \ntheir systemic and diuretic effects and are therefore less likely \nto be involved in digitalis toxicity. The potassium-sporing \ndiuretics, in contrast to the other groups, can be useful in pre\u00ad\nventing such interactions with digitalis but may cause hyper\u00ad\nkalemia, which can be arrhythmogenic. \nD List 5 major types of diu reties and relate them to their sites of action. \nD Describe 2 drugs that reduce potassium loss during sodium diuresis. \nD Describe a therapy that reduces calcium excretion in patients who have recurrent uri-\nnary stones. \nD Describe a treatment for severe acute hypercalcemia in a patient with metastatic cancer. \nD Describe a method for reducing urine volume in nephrogenic diabetes insipid us. \nD Describe a method for increasing water excretion in SIADH secretion. \nD Describe a group of drugs that reduce glucose reabsorption in the nephron and cause a \nconcomitant diuresis. \nD List the major applications and the toxicities of acetazolamide, thiazides, loop diuretics, \nand potassium-sparing diuretics. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

This response involves a small red spot at the center of \nan intradermal injection of histamine surrounded by an edema\u00ad\ntous wheal, which is surrounded by a red flare. \nf. H1 receptor-This Gq-coupled receptor rs rmponant in \nsmooth muscle effects, especially those caused by IgE-mediated \nresponses. Inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) \nare the second messengers. Typical responses include pain and \nitching in the skin, bronchoconstriction, and vasodilation, the lat\u00ad\nter caused by histamine-evoked release of nitric oxide. Capillary \nendothelial cells, in addition to releasing nitric oxide (NO) and \nother vasodilating substances, also contract, opening gaps in the \npermeability barrier and leading to the formation of local edema. \nThese effects occur in allergic reactions and in mastocytosis. \n2. H2 receptor-This G,-coupled receptor mediates gastric acid \nsecretion by parietal cells in the stomach. It also mediates a cardiac \nstimulant effect. A third action is to reduce histamine release from \nmast cells-a negative feedback effect. These actions are medi\u00ad\nated by activation of adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular \ncyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). \n3. H 1 receptor- This G;-coupled receptor appears to be involved \nmainly in presynaptic modulation ofhistaminergic neurotransmis\u00ad\nsion in the central nervous system (CNS}. Food intake and body \nweight are increased in Hrreceptor knockout animals; therefore, \nselective H3 agonists are under investigation as appetite suppres\u00ad\nsants. In the periphery, this receptor appears to be a presynap\u00ad\ntic heteroreceptor with modulatory effects on the release of other \ntransmitters (see Chapter 6). \n4. H4 receptor-The H4 receptor is located on leukocytes (espe\u00ad\ncially eosinophils) and mast cells and is involved in chemotactic \nresponses by these cells. Like H3, it is Gi coupled. \nB. Clinical Use \nHistamine has no therapeutic applications, but drugs that block \nits effects at H1 and H2 receptors are very important in clinical \nmedicine. No agonists or antagonists of H3 or H4 receptors are \ncurrently available for clinical use. \nHISTAMINE H1 ANTAGONISTS \nA. Classification and Prototypes \nA wide variety of antihistaminic H 1 blockers are available from several \ndifferent chemical families. Two major subgroups or \"generations\" \nhave been developed. The older members of the first-generation \nagents, typified by diphenhydramine, are highly sedating H1 \nblockers with significant autonomic receptor-blocking effects. \nDimenhydrinatc, doxylamine, and pro.metbazine are similar \nolder H1 antagonists. A newer subgroup of first-generation agents \nis less sedating and has much less autonomic effect. Chlorpheni\u00ad\nramine and cydizine may be considered prototypes. The second\u00ad\ngeneration H1 blockers, typified by c:etirizine, faofenadine, and \nloratadine, are far less Upid soluble than the first-generation agents and have greatly reduced sedating and autonomic effects in most \nindividuals. All H1 blockers are active by the oral route. Several are \npromoted for topical use in the eye or nose. Most are metabolized \nextensivdy in the liver. Half-lives of the older H 1 blockers vary from \n4 to 12 h. Second-generation agents have half-lives of 12-24 h. \nB. Mechanism and Effeds \nH1 blockers are competitive pharmacologic antagonists or inverse \nagonists at the H1 receptor; these drugs have no effect on hista\u00ad\nmine release from storage sites. They are more effective if given \nbefore histamine release occurs. \nBecause their structure closdy resembles that of muscarinic \nblockers and a-adrenoceptor blockers, many of the first-generation \nagents are potent pharmacologic antagonists at these autonomic \nreceptors. A few also block serotonin receptors. As noted, most \nolder first-generation agents are sedating, and some--not all\u00ad\nfirst-generation agents have anti-motion sickness effects. Many \nH1 blockers are potent local anesthetics. H1-blocking drugs have \nnegligible effects at H2 receptors. \nC. Clinical Use \nH1 blockers have major applications in allergies of the immedi\u00ad\nate type (ie, those caused by antigens acting on IgE antibody\u00ad\nsensitized mast cells). These conditions include hay fever and urti\u00ad\ncaria. They are of little or no value in asthma. \nDiphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, cyclizine, meclizine, and \npromethazine are also used as anti-motion sickness drugs. Diphen\u00ad\nhydramine is also used for management of chemotherapy-induced \nvomiting. Doxylamine, in combination with pyridoxine, is pro\u00ad\nmoted for the prevention of morning sickness in pregnancy.* \nAdverse effects of the first-generation H1 blockers are some\u00ad\ntimes exploited therapeutically (eg, in their use as hypnotics in \nover-the-counter sleep aids). \nD. Toxicity and Interactions \nSedation is common, especially with diphenhydramine and \npromethazine and these drugs should not be consumed before \noperating machinery. Sedation is much less common with second\u00ad\ngeneration agents, which do not enter the CNS readily. Antimus\u00ad\ncarinic effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision occur with \nsome first-generation drugs in some patients. Alpha-adrenoceptor \nblockade, which is significant with phenothiazine derivatives such \nas promethazine, may cause orthostatic hypotension. \nInteractions occur between older antihistamines and other drugs \nwith sedative effects (eg, benzodiazepines and alcohol). Drugs that \ninhibit hepatic metabolism may result in dangerously high levels \nof certain antihistaminic drugs that are taken concurrently. For \nexample, azole antifungal drugs and certain other CYP3A4 inhibi\u00ad\ntors interfere with the metabolism of astemizole and terfenadine, \ntwo second-generation agents that have been withdrawn from the \nUS market because high plasma concentrations of either antihista\u00ad\nmine can precipitate lethal arrhythmias. \n\u2022noxylamine with pyridoxine was originally available as Bendectin but was with\u00ad\ndrawn due to an unwarranted fear of teratogenic effects. It is again available in the \nUSA as DidegU."

Classification and Prototypes \nFour H2 blockers are available; cimetidine is the prototype. Raniti\u00ad\ndine, famotldine, and nimti.dine differ only in having fewer adverse \neffects than cimetidine. These drugs do not resemble H1 blockers \nstructurally. They are orally active, with half-lives of 1-3 h. Because \nthey are all rdatively nontoxic, they can be given in large doses, so \nthat the duration of action of a single dose may be 12-24 h. All four \nagents are available in oral over-the-counter formulations. \nB. Mechanism and Effeds \nH2 antagonists produce a surmountable pharmacologic blockade \nof histamine H2 receptors. They are relatively selective and have \nno significant blocking actions at H 1 or autonomic receptors. The \nonly therapeutic effect of clinical importance is the reduction of \ngastric acid secretion, especially at night. Blockade of cardiovas\u00ad\ncular and mast cell Hrreceptor-mediated effects can be demon\u00ad\nstrated but has no clinical significance. \nC. Cllnlcal Use \nIn acid-peptic disease, especially duodenal ulcer, these drugs \nreduce nocturnal acid secretion, accelerate healing, and prevent \nrecurrences. Acute ulcer is usually treated with 2 or more doses per \nday, whereas recurrence of duodenal ulcers can often be prevented \nwith a single bedtime dose. H2 blockers are also effective in accel\u00ad\nerating healing and preventing recurrences of gastric peptic ulcers. \nIntravenous H2 blockers are useful in preventing gastric erosions \nand hemorrhage that occur in stressed patients in intensive care \nunits. In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is associated with gas\u00ad\ntrinoma and characterized by acid hypersecretion, severe recurrent \npeptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diarrhea, these \ndrugs are hdpful, but very large doses are required; proton pump \ninhibitors are preferred. Similarly, the H2 blockers have been used \nin gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but they are not as \neffective as proton pump inhibitors (see Chapter 59). \nSKI LL KEEPER: ANTIHISTAMINE ADVERSE \nEFFECTS (SEE CHAPTERS 8 AND 10) \nAn elderly dental patient was given promethazine intrave\u00ad\nnously to reduce anxiety before undergoing an extraction in \nthe dental office.

Toxicity \nCimetidine is a potent inhibitor of hepatic drug-metabolizing \nenzymes (see Chapter 4) and may also reduce hepatic blood flow. \nCimetidine also has significant antiandrogen effects in patients \nreceiving high doses. Ranitidinc has a weaker inhibitory effect \nthan cimetidine on hepatic drug metabolism; only cimetidine of \nthe H2 blockers appears to have any endocrine effects. SEROTONIN (5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMIN E; \n5-HT) & RELATED AGONISTS \nSerotonin is produced from tryptophan and stored in vesicles in \nthe enterochromaffin cells of the gut and neurons of the CNS \nand the enteric nervous system. After release, it is metabolized by \nmonoa.mine oxidase. Excess production in the body (cg, in carci\u00ad\nnoid syndrome) can be detected by measuring its major metabolite, \n5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), in the urine. Serotonin \npla}'ll a ph}'lliologic role as a neurotransmitter in both the CNS \nand the enteric nervous system and may have a role as a local hor\u00ad\nmone that modulates gastrointestinal activity. After release from \nneurons, it is partially taken back up into the nerve ending by \nthe serotonin reuptake tranlporter (SERT). Serotonin is also \nstored (but synthesized to only a minimal extent) in platelets. In \nspite of the very large number of serotonin receptors (14 identi\u00ad\nfied to date), most of the serotonin agonists in clinical use act at \n5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT4 receptors. Serotonin antagonists in use \nor under investigation act at 5-HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors (see drug \noverview figure at the beginning of the chapter). \nA. Receptors and Effects \n1. 5-HT1 receptors-5-HT1 receptors are most important in \nthe brain and mediate synaptic inhibition via increased potassium \nconductance (Table 16-1). Peripheral 5-HT1 receptors mediate \nboth excitatory and inhibitory effects in various smooth muscle \ntissues. 5-HT 1 receptors arc G1-protein-couplcd. \n2. 5-HT2 receptors-5-HT 2 receptors are important in both \nbrain and peripheral tissues. These receptors mediate synap\u00ad\ntic excitation in the CNS and smooth muscle contraction (gut, \nbronchi, uterus, some vessds) or relaxation (other vessels). Several \nmechanisms are involved, including (in different tissues) increased \nIP3, decreased potassium conductance , and decreased cAMP. This \nreceptor probably mediates some of the vasodilation, diarrhea, and \nbronchoconstriction that occur as signs of carcinoid tumor, a neo\u00ad\nplasm that releases serotonin and other substances. In the CNS, \n5-HT 2c receptors mediate a reduction in appetite that has been \nused in the treatment of obesity. \n3. 5-HT3 receptors-5-HT3 receptors are found in the CNS, \nespecially in the chemorcceptive area and vomiting center, and \nin peripheral sensory and enteric nerves. These receptors mediate \nexcitation via a 5-HT-gated cation channel. Antagonists acting at \nthis receptor are extremdy useful antiemetic drugs. \n4. 5-HT,,. receptors-5-HT4 receptors are found in the gastro\u00ad\nintestinal tract and play an important role in intestinal motility. \nB. Clinical Uses \nSerotonin has no clinical applications, but more sdective agonists \nare useful. \n1. 5-HT1Dl18agonlsts-Sumatri.pwi. is the prototype. Naratriptan \nand other \"-triptans\" arc similar to sumatriptan (see Drug Summary \nTable). They are the first-line treatment for acute migraine and \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Ergot alkaloids, discussed later, are partial \nagonists at some 5-HT receptors. Calcitonin gene-rdatcd peptide \n(CGRP) has been associated with migraine through a non-5-HT\u00ad\nrelated mechanism and antagonists of this peptide are now avail\u00ad\nable (see Other Drugs Used in Migraine, bdow). \n3. 5-HT2c agonists-Lorcaserin was approved for the treatment \nof obeaity but has recently been removed from the market in the \nUSA because of suspected risk of cancer. It activates receptors in \nthe CNS and appears to moderately reduce appetite. Older agonist \ndrugs, fenfluraminc and dcdenfluramine, appear to act mainly \nby releasing neuronal 5-HT or inhibiting SERT, and thereby acti\u00ad\nvating central 5-HT 2C receptors. They were withdrawn in the USA \nbecause their use was associated with pulmonary hypertension and \ndamage to cardiac valves. Fcnfluramine and dexfenfluraminc were \nalso combined with phentermine, an amphetamine-like anorexi\u00ad\nant, in weight-loss products known as \"fen-phen\" and \"dex-phen,\" \nrespectively. Because of pulmonary and cardiac toxicity, these \ncombination products are banned in the USA. Fenfluramine is \ncurrently available under restricted use for Dravet syndrome, a sei\u00ad\nzure disorder. \n4. 5-HT4 Parda/ agonlst-Tegaserod acts as an agonist in the \ncolon. It was approved and briefly marketed for use in chronic consti\u00ad\npation, but because of cardiovascular toxicity, its use is now restricted. \n5. Selective serotonin reuptoke Inhibitors (SSRIJ-A num\u00ad\nber of important antidepressant drugs act to increase activity at \ncentral serotonergic synapses by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake \ntransporter, SERT. These drugs are discussed in Chapter 30. C. Hyperthermic Syndromes \nSerotonin and drugs with 5-HT agonise effects arc sometimes asso\u00ad\nciated with drug reactions with high fever, CNS alterations, skel\u00ad\netal muscle effects, and cardiovascular abnormalities that can be \nfatal. These important syndromes are summarized in Table 16-2. \nSEROTONIN ANTAGONISTS \nA. Classification and Prototypes \nKctanscdn, phcnoxybcnT.amine, and cyproheptadinc arc effec\u00ad\ntive 5-HT2 blockers. Ondansctron, granisetron, dolasetron, and \nalosctron are 5-HT 3 blockers. The ergot alkaloids are partial ago\u00ad\nnists (and therefore have some antagonist effects) at 5-HT and \nother receptors (see later discussion). \nB. Mechanisms and Effects \nKetanserin and cyproheptadine are competitive pharmacologic \n5-HT2 antagonists. Phenoxybenzamine (see Chapter 10) is an \nirreversible blocker at this receptor. \nKetanserin, cyproheptadine, and phenoxybenzamine are poorly \nselective agents. In addition to inhibition of serotonin effects, \nother actions include a-blockade (ketanserin, phenoxybenzamine) \nor H1-blockade (cyproheptadine). \nOndansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron are selective 5-HT3 \nreceptor blockers and have important antiemetic actions in the \narea postrema of the medulla and also on peripheral sensory and \nenteric nerves. Although it acts at the 5-HT3 receptor, alosetron \nappears to lack these antiemetic effects. \nC. Clinical Uses \nKetanserin is used as an antihypertensive drug outside the United \nStates. Ketanserin, cyproheptadine, and phcnoxybenzamine may \nbe of value (separately or in combination) in the treatment of \ncarcinoid tumor, a neoplasm that secretes large amounts of sero\u00ad\ntonin (and peptides) and causes diarrhea, bronchoconstriction, \nand flushing. \nTABLE 16-2 Characteristics of serotonin syndrome and other hyperthermlc syndromes. \nSyndrome \nSerotonin syndrome \nNeuroleptlc \nmalignant syndrome \nMalignant \nhyperthermla Precipitating Drugs \nSSRls, second-generation anti\u00ad\ndepressants, MAOls, linezolid, \ntramadol, meperldlne, rentanyl, \nondansetron, sumatriptan, MOMA. \nLSD, St. John's wort, ginseng \n02-blocking antipsychotic drugs \nVolatile anesthetics, \nsuccfnylchollne \n\u2022precipitating drugs should be discontinued immediately. \nbAll first-line therapy is in bold font.

Alosetron is used in the treatment of women \nwith irritable bowel syndrome associated with diarrhea. \nD.Toxicity \nAdverse effects ofketanserin are those of ex blockade and H1 block\u00ad\nade. The toxicities of ondansetron, graniseuon, and dolaseuon \ninclude diarrhea and headache. Dolasetron has been associated \nwith QRS and QT, prolongation in the ECG and should not be \nused in patients with heart disease. Alosetron causes significant \nconstipation in some patients and has been associated with fatal \nbowel complications. \nTREATMENT OF OBESITY \nDuring the past decade, it has become apparent that a significant \nand increasing fraction of the world's population is overweight or \nobese. Current guidelines define degrees of excess weight on the \nbasis of the body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m]2). A BMI of \n18.5-24.9 is considered normal; overweight = 25-29.9; obesity \nclass I = 30-34.9; obesity class II = 35-39.9; and extreme obesity \n(class III) ~ 40. A waist measurement greater than one-half the \nheight is another marker. Excess body weight is associated with \nnumerous health risks, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 dia\u00ad\nbetes, and cardiovascular disease. The physiological and behavioral \ncontrol of appetite and body weight is multifactorial and appears \nto involve histamine, 5-HT, and many other receptors. As indi\u00ad\ncated in Table 16-3, only one of the recently approved medica\u00ad\ntions (lorcaserin, now withdrawn in the USA) is based on 5-HT \neffects. As noted in the previous discussion of 5-HT2,-sdective \nagents, significant pulmonary and cardiac toxicity may be associ\u00ad\nated with drugs selective for this receptor subtype. Amphetamine \nmirnetics, for example, phenterrnine, are still in heavy use for \nTABLE 16-3 Anti-obesity drugs and their effects. \nDrug or Drug Posslble Mechanism of \nCombination Drug Group Action \nOrlistat GI lipase inhibitor Reduces lipid absorption \nLirag I utlde GLP-1 agonlst Decreases appetite \nLorcaserln 5-HT 2< agonist Decreases appetite \nNaltrexone/ Opioid antagonist + Unknown \nbuproplon antidepressant \nPhentermine Sympathomimetic Norepinephrine release \nIn CNS \nPhentermlne/ Sympathomlmetlc + Noreplnephrlne release \ntopiramate antiseizure agent plus unknown mechanism appetite reduction although clinical evidence shows that efficacy \nis limited and transient. \nERGOT ALKALOIDS \nThese complex molecules are produced by a fungus (Claviceps \npurpurea) found in wet or spoiled grain. They are responsible for \nthe epidemics of \"St. Anthony's Fire\" (ergotism) described dur\u00ad\ning the Middle Ages and recurring to the present time. There are \nat least 20 naturally occurring members of the family, but only a \nfew of these and a handful of semisynthetic derivatives are used as \ntherapeutic agents. Most ergot alkaloids are partial agonists at a \nadrenoceptors and 5-HT receptors, and some are potent agonists \nat dopamine receptors. \nA. Classlflcatlon and Effects \nThe ergot alkaloids may be divided into three major subgroups on \nthe basis of the organ or tissue in which they have their primary \neffects. The receptor effects of the ergot alkaloids are summarized \nin Table 16-4 and are most marked in the following tissues: \n1. Vessels-Ergot alkaloids can produce marked and prolonged \ncx-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Ergot.amine is the \nprototype. Thus, an overdose can cause ischemia and gangrene \nof the limbs or bowel. Because they are partial agonists, the drugs \nmay also block the a-agonist effects of sympathomirnetics, and \nergotamine can cause epinephrine reversal (see Chapter 10). \n2. Uterus-Ergot alkaloids produce powerful contraction in \nthis tissue, especially near term. Ergonovine is the prototype. \nIn pregnancy, the uterine contraction is sufficient to cause abor\u00ad\ntion or miscarriage. Earlier in pregnancy (and in the nonpregnant \nuterus) much higher doses of ergot alkaloids are needed to cause \ncontraction. \nDosage Toxidty \n60-120 mg no PO Decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, \nflatulence, fecal Incontinence \n3 mg/dSC Nausea, vomiting, pancreatftls \n10mgPOBID Headache , nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, \nconstipation \n32 mg/360 mg PO no Headache , nausea, dizziness, constipation \n30-37 5 mg/d PO Increased BP and HR, arrhythmias, insomnia, \nanxiety \n3.75-15 mg/23-92 mg PO Insomnia, dizziness, nausea, paresthesla, \ndysgeusia \nBID, twice daily; BP, blood pressure; CNS, central nervous system; GI, gastrointestinal; HR. heart rate; PO, by mouth; SC, subcutaneously; TIO, three times daily. \nModified with permission from Katzung BG, Vanderah TW: Basic& Cllnlcal Pharmacology, 15th ed.

Brain-Hallucinations may be prominent with the naturally \noccurring ergots and with ty.crgic acid diethylamide (LSD), a \nsemisynthetic prorotypic:al hallucinogenic ergot derivative; they are \nuncommon with the therapeutic ergot derivatives. Although LSD \nis a potent 5-HT2 blocker in peripheral tissues, actions in the CNS \nare thought to be due to agonist actions at 5-HT 2A receptors. In the \npituitary, some ergot alkaloids are potent dopamine-like agonists and \ninhibit prolactin secretion. Bromoaiptine and pergolide are among \nthe most potent semisynthetic ergot derivatives. They act as dopamine \nD2 agonists in the pituitary and the basal ganglia (see Chapter 28). \nB. Clinical Uses \n1. Migraine-Ergotami.nc was a mainstay of treatment of acute \nattacks and is still sometimes used in combination with caffeine. \nMethysergide, dihydroergotamine, and ergonovine have been used \nfor prophylaxis, but methysergide is no longer available in the \nUnited States. The triptan derivatives, for example, sumatriptan, \nare now considered preferable to the ergots because oflower toxicity. \n2. Obstetric bleedlng-Ergonovine and ergotamine are effec\u00ad\ntive agents for the reduction of postpartum bleeding. They pro\u00ad\nduce a powerful and long-lasting contraction that reduces bleeding \nbut must not be given before delivery of the placenta. \n3. Hyperprolactlnemla and parklnsonlsm-Bromoaiptinc, \npergolide, and cabergoline have been used to reduce prolactin secre\u00ad\ntion (dopamine is the physiologic prolactin release inhibitor; sec \nChapter 37). Pergolide has been withdrawn from the US market. \nBromocriptine also appears to reduce the size of pituitary tumors \nof the prolactin-secreting cells. Bromocriptine and cabergoline \nare used in hyperprolactinemia and off label to treat acromegaly. \nThese drugs have been used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, \nbut other drugs are preferred (see Chapter 28). \nC. Toxicity \nThe toxic effects of ergot alkaloids are quite important, both from \na public health standpoint (epidemics of crgotism from spoiled \ngrain) and from the toxicity resulting from overdose or abuse by \nindividuals. Intoxication of grazing animals is sometimes reported \nby farmers and veterinarians. 1. Vascular effects-Severe prolonged vasoconsmct1on can \nresult in ischemia and gangrene. The most consistently effective \nantidote is nitroprusside. When used for long periods, ergot deriv\u00ad\natives may produce an unusual hyperplasia of connective tissue. \nThis flbroplasia may be retroperitoneal, retropleural, or suben\u00ad\ndocardial and can cause hydronephrosis or cardiac valvular and \nconduction system malfunction. Similar lesions are found in some \npatients with carcinoid, suggesting that this action is probably \nmediated by agonist effects at serotonin receptors. \n2. Gastrointestinal effects-Ergot alkaloids cause gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) in many persons. \n3. Uterine effects-Marked uterine contractions may be pro\u00ad\nduced. The uterus becomes progressively more sensitive to ergot \nalkaloids during pregnancy. Although miscarriage resulting from \nthe use of ergot for migraine is rare, most obstetricians recom\u00ad\nmend avoidance or very conservative use of these drugs as preg\u00ad\nnancy progresses. \n4. CNS effects-Hallucinations resembling psychosis are com\u00ad\nmon with LSD but less so with the other ergot alkaloids. Methy\u00ad\nsergide was occasionally used in the past as an LSD substitute by \nusers of\"recreational\" drugs. \nOTHER DRUGS USED IN MIGRAINE \nCalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a powerful vasodila\u00ad\ntor peptide neurotransmitter that is released from trigeminal nerve \nfibers during migraine headache. Initial efforts to antagonize \nCGRP led to the development of several monoclonal antibodies \nthat are effective in reducing migraine frequency by 50% or more. \nErenumab binds to the CGRP receptor and prevents activation \nby the peptide. FremantLwnab and galcanezumab bind CGRP \nand prevent its binding to the receptor. These protein (biologic) \ndrugs must be administered by subcutaneous injection. Slow \nonset and long duration (1 month) make them suitable for pro\u00ad\nphylaxis but not for treatment of acute migraine headache. More \nrecently, oral small-molecule agents capable of interfering with the \nCGRP mechanism have become available. The first of these to be"

Serotonin causes bronchospasm, but the other effects listed \nare not observed. Carcinoid is associated with diarrhea and \nhypenension. The answer is B. \n2. The smooth muscle manifestations of angioneurotic edema \nare mediated by histamine at H 1 receptors and other media\u00ad\ntors of immediate allergy. Fexofenadine is a pharmacologic \nantagonist of histamine at these receptors with low CNS \neffect but has a slow onset of action. Promethazine is an older \nH1 antagonist used prophylactically to prevent postsurgical \nand chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Ranitidine is a phar\u00ad\nmacologic histamine antagonist that blocks the H2 receptor \nin the stomach and the heart, not H1 receptors in smooth \nmuscle. Tegaserod is a 5-HT4 partial agonist used in irritable \nbowd syndrome. Epinephrine has a rapid physiologic antago\u00ad\nnist action that reverses histamine's effects on smooth muscle. \nThe answer is A. \n3. H1 blockers do not activate muscarinic receptors, mediate \nvasoconstriction, or cause vertigo. Some relieve venigo or \nmotion sickness. They do not cause nervousness or anxi\u00ad\nety. Diphenhydramine is a potent sedative with H1-and \nMrblocking actions. The answer is D. \n4. H2 receptors are G,-protein-coupled receptors, like ~ adre\u00ad\nnoceptors. Blockade of this system will cause a decrease in \ncAMP in several tissues. The answer is C. \n5. Refer to Table 16-3.

Prorenin may itself act on a receptor but this \naction is poorly understood. Angiotensin I is an inactive decapep\u00ad\ntide, and is converted into angioteosin II (ANG II, also denoted \nAll), an active octapeptide, by angiotemin-converting enzyme \n(ACE), also known as ACE 1. peptidyl dipeptidase, or kininase II \n(see Figure 11-3). Angiotensin II, the active form of the peptide, \nis rapidly degraded by peptidases (angiotensinases). \nB. Effects and Clinical Role \nANG II is a potent arteriolar vasoconstrictor and stimulant of \naldosterone release; it also inhibits the release of renin. Conversely, \nrenin release is stimulated, a compensatory response, by vasodi\u00ad\nlators. ANG II directly increases peripheral vascular resistance \nand, through aldosterone, causes renal sodium retention. It also \nfacilitates the rdease of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve \nendings via presynaptic heteroreceptor action (see Chapter 6). All \nthese effects are mediated by the angiotensin AT1 receptor, a Gq\u00ad\ncoupled receptor. The AT 2 receptor appears to mediate vasodilation \n155"

            "Text": "VASOPEPTIDASE INHIBITORS \nThe vasopeptidase enzymes include neutral endopepticlase 24.11 \n(neprilysin) and ACE. A class of drugs that block both enzymes is in \nclinical trials, and these drugs (eg, omapatrilat) show c.onsiderable \nefficacy in hypertension and hean f.illure. They reduce the c.oncentra\u00ad\ntion of ANG II and increase the c.oncentration of natriuretic peptides \n(discussed below). Unfortunately, these drugs also cause angioedema \nin a significant number of patients and have not been approved fur \nclinical use. In c.ontrast, the selective neprilysin inhibitor saamitril, \nin c.ombination with the ARB valsartan, appears safer and is approved \nfur the treatment of chronic heart f.illure (see Chapter 13). \nBRADYKININ \nA. Source and Disposition \nBradykinin is one of several vasodilator kinins produced from \nkininogen by a family of enzymes, the kallikreins. Bradykinin is \nrapidly degraded by various peptidases, including ACE. \nB. Effects and Clinical Role \nBradykinin acts through at least 2 receptors (B1 and B:z) and causes \nthe production ofinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP.J, diacylglycerol \n(DAG), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), nitric oxide, \nand prostaglandins in tissues. Bradykinin is one of the most potent \nvasodilators known. The peptide is involved in inflammation and \ncauses edema, vasodilation, and pain when released or injected \ninto tissue. Bradykinin can be found in saliva and may play a role \nin stimulating its secretion. \nBradykinin plays an important causative role in hereditary angio\u00ad\nedema and some other types of angioedema. Ecallantide, a par\u00ad\nenteral kallikrein inhibitor, and icatibant, a parenteral bradykinin \nBi-receptor antagonist, are approved fur use in angioedema. Brady\u00ad\nkinin synthesis can be inhibited by the human plasma derivatives \nCinryze and Berinert. They are also approved fur use in hereditary \nangioedema. Although it has no therapeutic application, bradykinin \nmay play a beneficial role in the antihypertensive action of ACE \ninhibitors, as previously noted (see Chapter 11; Figure 11-3). \nNATRIURETIC PEPTIDES \nA. Source and Disposition \nNatriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP] and brain \nnatriuretic peptide [BNP]) are synthesized and stored in the car\u00ad\ndiac atria of mammals. BNP has also been isolated from brain tis\u00ad\nsue. They are released from the atria in response to distention of \nthe chambers. A similar peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), \nhas been isolated from other tissues. U rodilatin, a peptide similar \nto ANP, is synthesized in the kidney. BNP appears to be the most \nimportant of these peptides. Disposition of the natriuretic peptides \noccurs through metabolism by neprilysin and ACE. \nB. Effects and Clinical Role \nNatriuretic peptides activate guanylyl cyclase in many tissues via \na membrane-spanning enzyme receptor. They act as vasodilators CHAPTER 17 Vasoactive Peptides 157 \nas well as natriuretic (sodium excretion-enhancing) agents. Their \nrenal action includes increased glomerular filtration, decreased \nproximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and inhibitory effects on \nrenin secretion. The peptides also inhibit the actions of ANG II \nand aldosterone. Although they lack positive inotropic action, \nendogenous natriuretic peptides may play an important compensa\u00ad\ntory role in c.ongestive heart failure by limiting sodium retention. \nBlood levels of endogenous BNP have been shown to correlate with \nthe severity of heart failure and can be used as a diagnostic marker. \nBNP administered as a drug has shown some benefit in the \ntreatment of acute severe heart failure and is currently available for \nclinical use as nesiritide. This drug is approved fur intravenous \nadministration in acute heart failure (see Chapter 13) but has very \nsignificant toxicity. In c.ontrast, sacubitril is a selective inhibitor \nof neprilysin, is of proven benefit in chronic heart failure with \nreduced ejection fraction, and, in combination with valsartan, is \napproved for oral use for this indication. \nAnalogs of CNP are investigational in the treatment of achon\u00ad\ndroplasia. CNP appears to increase endochondral ossification and \nimproves growth velocity in children with this condition. \nENDOTHELINS \nEndothelins are peptide vasoc.onstrictors formed in and released \nby endothelial cells in blood vessels. Endothelins appear to func\u00ad\ntion as autocrine and paracrine hormones in the vasculature. Three \nendothelin peptides (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3) with minor varia\u00ad\ntions in amino acid sequence have been identified in humans. Two \nreceptors, ET A and ET B\u2022 have been identified, both of which are \nG-protein-coupled to their effectors. The ET A receptor appears to \nbe responsible for the vasoconstriction produced by endothelins. \nEndothelins are much more potent than norepinephrine as \nvasoconstrictors and have a relatively long-lasting effect. These pep\u00ad\ntides also stimulate the heart, increase natriuretic peptide release, \nactivate smooth muscle proliferation, and reduce glomerular filtra\u00ad\ntion rate. The peptides may be involved in causing some forms \nof systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypenension, and other car\u00ad\ndiovascular disorders. ET A antagonists available for the treatment \nof pulmonary hypertension include bosentan and ambrisentan. \nMacitentan, a newer dual inhibitor of both endothelin receptors, \nis also available for use in pulmonary hypertension. Riociguat is an \noral activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase {not an ET receptor antag\u00ad\nonist) that is also approved for use in pulmonary hypertension. \nVIP, SUBSTANCE P, CGRP, & NPY \nVIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) is an extremely potent vasodi\u00ad\nlator but is probably more important as a neurotransmitter. It is \nfound in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal tract. Its actions are mediated by G,-coupled recep\u00ad\ntors and increased cAMP. No clinical application has been found \nfur this peptide. \nThe neurokinins, also known as tachykinins, include sub\u00ad\nstance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B.

The peptide may also fimc\u00ad\ntion as a local hormone in the gastrointestinal tract. Highest concen\u00ad\ntrations of substance P are found in the parts of the nervous system \nthat contain neurons subserving pain. Captaicin, the \"hot\" com\u00ad\nponent of chili peppers, releases substance P from its stores in nerve \nendings and depletes the peptide. Capsaicin has been approved fur \ntopical use on arthritic joints and for postherpetic neuralgia. \nN eurokinins appear to be involved in certain CNS conditions, \nincluding depression and nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is an \noral antagonist at NK1 receptors and is approved for use in chemo\u00ad\ntherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; fmaprepitant is a prodrug \nfor aprepitant that is used parenterally. \nCGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is found (along with \ncalcitonin) in high concentrations in the thyroid but is also pres\u00ad\nent in most smooth muscle tissues. It is a very potent vasodilator. \nThe presence of CGRP in smooth muscle suggests a function as \na cotransmitter in autonomic nerve endings. CGRP is the most \npotent hypotensive agent discovered to date and causes reflex tachy\u00ad\ncardia. Significant evidence indicates that CGRP release by tri\u00ad\ngeminal nerve endings is a major mediator in migraine headache. \nCurrently, there is no clinical application for this peptide. How\u00ad\never, CGRP antagonists have become very important in the treat\u00ad\nment of migraine. Three parenteral antibodies and one oral drug \nare now approved. Erenumab blocks the CGRP receptor, while \n&emanezumab and galcanezumab bind CGRP itself and prevent \nit from activating the receptor.

In experimental animals, NPY administered in the \nCNS stimulates feeding and causes hypotension and hypothermia. \nPeripheral administration causes positive chronotropic and inotro\u00ad\npic effects in the heart and hypertension. Several receptor subtypes \nhave been identified, but neither agonists nor antagonists of this \npeptide have found clinical application. \nAVP (VASOPRESSIN, ANTIDIURETIC \nHORMONE, ADH) \nThis peptide is synthesized in the hypothalamus and secreted by \nthe posterior pituitary. As indicated by its names, arginine vaso\u00ad\npressin (A VP) has pressor effects in the vasculature and antidiuretic \neffect in the kidney. The antidiuretic effect is discussed in Chapter \n15. The presser effects are mediated by V1\u2022 receptors; V1b receptors \nare involved in ACTH release; and V2 receptors are responsible for \nthe antidiuretic action. V11 receptors are Gq-coupled membrane \nreceptors and generate IP3 and increased intracellular calcium. \nA VP is sometimes used in combination with norepinephrine \nin the treatment of septic shock. Selective V1\u2022 antagonists are in \nclinical trials. Conivaptan, a V1\u2022 and V2 antagonist, is approved \nfor use in hyponatremia.

Histamine and bradykinin both cause a marked increase in \ncapillary permeability that is often associated with edema, but \nhistamine is not a peptide. The answer is B. \n2. Substance P is a potent arterial vasodilator and venoconstric\u00ad\ntor. The answer is D. CHAPTER 17 Vasoactive Peptides 159 \n3. BNP is an atrial and brain peptide found in increased amounts \nin patients with heart failure. The commercial formulation \n(nesiritide) is approved for use in severe acute heart failure but \nhas significant renal toxicity. The answer is C. \n4. Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, is used in primary hypertension. \nCapsaicin, the \"hot\" constiruent of hot peppers, is the mole\u00ad\ncule responsible for release of substance P. Conivaptan, an AVP \nantagonist, is used in hyponatremia. Sacubitril, a ncprilysin \nantagonist, is used in heart failure. Macitentan, an end.othelin \nantagonist, is used in pulmonary hypertension. The answer is D. \n5. Substance P is an important pain-mediating neurotransmit\u00ad\nter peptide and appears to be involved in postherpetlc pain as \nwell as arthritic pain. Capsaicin can be used topically to deplete \nsubstance P stores from sensory nerves. The answer is D. \n6. Angiotcnsin II, an octapeptide, iricreases when blood volume \ndecreases {a diuretic effect) because the compensatory response \ncauses an increase irI renirI secretion. Its precursor, angiotensin \nI, would also iricrease, but it is a decapeptide. The answer is B. \n7. Bradykinin increases because the enzyme inhibited by captopril, \nangiotensin-converting enzyme, degrades kinins in addition to \nsynthesizing angiotensin II (see Figure 11-3). The answer is B. \n8. Aprepitant and ondansetron are both used to reduce or pre\u00ad\nvent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Ondansc\u00ad\ntron is an antagonist at 5-HT3 receptors. The answer is B. \n9. Capsaicin inhibits substance P and is used to reduce the pain \nof arthritis and postherpetic pain. Ecallantide blocks bradyki\u00ad\nnin B2 receptor and is used in angioedema. Macitentan blocks \nETA and ET B receptors and is used in pulmonary hyperten\u00ad\nsion. Sacubitril inhibits neprilyiiin and is indicated for heart \nfailure. Erenumab blocks the CGRP receptor and is admiriis\u00ad\ntered by subcutaneous injection once per month for migraine \nprophylaxis. The answer is B. \n10. Severe hyponatremia is potentially lethal and requires urgent \ntreatment. Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, is used irI heart failure. \nFurosemide, a loop diuretic, increases the excretion of salt as well \nas water and is potentially dangerous in hyponatremia. Maciten\u00ad\ntan is valuable in pulmonary hypertension, not hyponatremia. \nVasoprcssin inhibits the excretion of water and is contraindi\u00ad\ncated irI hyponatremia. Tolvaptan is a vasopressirI antagonist \nand is a drug of choice in hyponatremia. The answer is D. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: ANGIOTENSIN \nANTAGONISTS (SEE CHAPTER 11) \nBoth ACE inhibitors (eg, captopril) and AT,-receptor blockers (eg, \nlosartan, valsartan) reduce the effects of the renin-angiotensin\u00ad\naldosterone system and thereby reduce blood pressure. Both \nresult in a compensatory increase in the release of renin and \nangiotensin I. A major difference between the 2 types of drugs \nresults from the fact that ACE inhibitors increase the circu\u00ad\nlating levels of bradykinin because braclylcinin Is normally \ninactivated by ACE. The increase in bradykinin contributes to \nthe hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors but is probably also \nresponsible for the high incidence of cough associated with \nACE inhibitor use. The cough is believed to result from prosta\u00ad\nglandins synthesized as a result of increased bradykinin. AT,\u00ad\nreceptor blockers have a lower incidence of cough. However, \nboth groups of drugs interfere with renal development in the \nfetus and are contraindicated in pregnancy."

Families of eicosanoids of clinical importance include straight-chain derivatives Oeukot\u00ad\nrienes) and cyclic derivatives (prostacyclin, prostaglandins, and \nthromboxane). \nElcounolda \nLeukotrienes \n(L TB4, L TC4, LTD,.)

Classification \nThe principal eicosanoids are derived from aradiidonic add. The \nmajor subgroups are the leukotriena and a group of cyclic molecules, \nincluding pronaglandins, prostacydin, and tbmmbonne. The \nleukotrienes retain the straight-chain configuration of the parent ara\u00ad\nchidonic acid. Prostacyclin, thromboxane, and other members of the \nprostaglandin group are cyclized derivatives of arachidonic acid. There \nare several series fur most of the principal subgroups, based on differ\u00ad\nent substituents (indicated by letters A, B, etc) and different numbers \nof double bonds (indicated by a subscript number) in the molecule. \nB. Synthesis \nActive eicosanoids are synthesized in response to a wide variety \nof stimuli (eg, physical injury, immune reactions). These stimuli \nactivate phospholipases in the cell membrane or cytoplasm, and \n162 I Prostaglandin I \nantagonists \n{corticosteroids, NSAI Ds) \narachidonic acid (a tetraenoic [4 double bonds] fatty acid) is \nreleased from membrane phospholipids (Figure 18-1). Arachi\u00ad\ndonic acid is then metabolized by several different enzymes. The \ntwo most important are lipoxygcnue (LOX), which results in \nstraight-chain leukotrienes, and cydooxygcnase (COX), which \nresults in cyclization to prostacyclin, prostaglandins, or throm\u00ad\nboxane. COX exists in at least two forms. COX-1 is found in \nmany tissues; the prostaglandins produced by COX-I appear to be \nimportant for a variety of normal physiologic processes (see later \ndiscussion). In contrast, COX-2 is found primarily in inflamma\u00ad\ntory cells; the products of its actions play a major role in tissue \ninjury (eg, inflammation). In addition to these inflammatory func\u00ad\ntions, COX-2 is also responsible for synthesis of prostacyclin and \nof prostaglandins important in normal renal function. Thrombox\u00ad\nane is preferentially synthesized in platelets, whereas prostacyclin \nis synthesized in the endothelial cells of blood vessels. Naturally \noccurring eicosanoids have very short half-lives (seconds to min\u00ad\nutes) and are inactive when given orally. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Some of the most \nimportant effects are summarized in Table 18-1. Eicosanoids \nmost directly involved in pathologic processes include prostaglan\u00ad\ndin F2a, thromboxane A2 (TICAi), and the leukotrienes L TC4 and \nLTD4\u2022 LTC4 and LTD4 are components of an important media\u00ad\ntor of bronchoconstriction and shock, slow\u00b7.rcacting substance \nof anaphylaxis (SRS\u00b7A). Leukotriene LTB4 is a chemotactic fac\u00ad\ntor important in inflammation. PG\u00a3i and prostacyclin may act \nas endogenous vasodilators. PGE1 and its analogs have significant \nprotective effects on the gastric mucosa. The mechanism may \ninvolve increased secretion of bicarbonate and mucus, decreased \nacid secretion, or both. PGE1 and PG\u00a3i rdax vascular and other \nsmooth muscle. PG:Ei appears to be the natural vasodilator that \nmaintains patency of the ductus arteriosus during fetal devdop\u00ad\nment. In the kidney, prostaglandins are important modulators of \nglomerular filtration and act on the afferent and efferent arteri\u00ad\noles and mesangial cdls. Suppression of prostaglandin production \nwith nonsteroidal anti\u00b7inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, see follow\u00ad\ning text) can markedly reduce the efficacy of diuretic agents (see \nChapter 15). PG:Ei and PGF2a are rdeased in large amounts from \nthe endometrium during menstruation and can cause dysmenor\u00b7 \nrhea. PG:Ei appears to be involved in the physiologic softening of \nthe cervix at term; PG:Ei and PGF2a may play a physiologic role in \nlabor. Platdet aggregation is strongly activated by thromboxane. \nTopical PGF2a reduces intraocular pressure (see later discussion), \nbut it is not known whether this is also a physiologic effect of \nendogenous PGF2a\u00b7 \nE. Cllnlcal Uses \n1. Obstetrlcs-PG\u00a3i and PGF2a cause contraction of the uterus. \nPGE2 (as dinoprostone) is approved for use to soften the cervix \nat term before induction of labor with oxytocin. Both PGE2 and \nPGF2a have been used as abortifacients in the second trimester \nof pregnancy.

Misoprostol has been used for this \npurpose in combination with either methotrexate or mifepristone \nin the United States. Misoprostol may cause diarrhea. \n2. Pediatrics-PGE1 is given as an infusion to maintain patency \nof the ductus arteriosus in infants with transposition of the great \nvessels until surgical correction can be undertaken. \n3. Pulmonary hypertension and dialysis-Prostacyelin \n(PGii) is approved for use (as epoprostcnol) in severe pulmo\u00ad\nnary hypertension and to prevent platdet aggregation in dialysis \nmachines. \n4. Peptic ulcer associated with NSAID use-Misoprostol is \napproved in the United States for the prevention of peptic ulcers \nin patients who must take high doses ofNSAIDs for arthritis and \nwho have a history of ulcer associated with NSAID use. \n5.

            "Text": "sdective inhibitor of lipoxygenase; some cyclooxygenase inhibitors \nalso exert a mild inhibitory effect on lipoxygenase. Inhibitors of \nthe receptors for the prostaglandins and the leukotrienes are being \nactively sought. Montelukast and zafirlukast, oral inhibitors at \nCysLT1 (the LTD4 receptor), are currently available for the treat\u00ad\nment of asthma (see Chapter 20). \nA. Corticosteroids \nAs indicated in Figure I8-I, corticosteroids inhibit the release of \narachidonic acid by phospholipases in the membrane. This effect \nis mediated by intracellular steroid receptors that, when activated \nby an appropriate steroid, increase expression of specific proteins \ncapable of inhibiting phospholipase. Steroids also inhibit the syn\u00ad\nthesis of COX-2. These effects are thought to be major mecha\u00ad\nnisms of the important anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids \n(see Chapter 39). \nB.NSAIDs \nAspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase and the pro\u00ad\nduction of thromboxane, prostaglandins, and prostacyclin (see \nFigure I8-I). Most of the currently available NSAIDs, for exam\u00ad\nple, ibuprofen and naproxen, nonselectively inhibit both COX-I \nand COX-2. In fact, many inhibit COX-I somewhat more effec.. \ntively than COX-2, the isoform thought to be responsible for syn\u00ad\nthesis of inflammatory eicosanoids. Celecoxib is the most selective \nCOX-2 inhibitor available in the United States; meloxicam is also \nslightly COX-2-selective. The highly COX-2-selective rofecoxib \nand valdecoxib were withdrawn from the US market because of \nreports of cardiovascular toxicity (see Chapter 36). \nInhibition of cyclooxygenase by aspirin is irreversible, unlike the \nreversible inhibition produced by other NSAIDs. Aspirin \"allergy\" \n(a form of hypersensitivity) may result from diversion of arachi\u00ad\ndonic acid to the leukotriene pathway when the cyclooxygenase\u00ad\ncatalyzcd prostaglandin pathway is blocked. The resulting increase \nin leukotriene synthesis causes the bronchoconstriction that is typi\u00ad\ncal of aspirin hypersensitivity. For unknown reasons, this form of \naspirin toxicity is more common in persons with nasal polyps. \nThe antiplatelet action of aspirin results from the fact that the \ndrug's inhibition of thromboxane synthesis is essentially perma\u00ad\nnent in platelets; non-nucleated cells lack the machinery for new \nprotein synthesis. Therefore, recovery of thromboxane production \nrequires the generation of new platelets. In contrast, inhibition of \nprostacyclin synthesis in the vascular endothelium is temporary \nbecause these nucleated cells can synthesize new enzyme. Inhi\u00ad\nbition of prostaglandin synthesis also results in important anti\u00ad\ninflammatory effects. Inhibition of synthesis of fever-inducing \nprostaglandins in the brain is responsible for the antipyretic action \nofNSAIDs. Closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in an otherwise \nnormal infant can be accelerated with an NSAID such as indo\u00ad\nmethacin or ibuprofen. \nC. Leukotriene Antagonists \nAs noted, an inhibitor of lipoxygenase (zilcuton) and LTD4 \nand LTE4 receptor antagonists (zafirlukast, montelukast) are CHAPTER 18 Prostaglandins & Other Eicosanoids 165 \navailable for clinical use. Currently, these agents are approved only \nfor use in asthma (see Chapter 20). \nQUESTIONS \nI.

A newborn infant is diagnosed with transposition of the great \nvessels, wherein the aorta exits from the right ventricle and \nthe pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. Which of the \nfollowing drugs is likely to be used in preparation for surgical \ncorrection of this anomaly? \n(A) Aspirin \n(B) Leukotriene LTC4 \n(C) Prednisone \n(D) Prostaglandin PGE1 \n(E) Prostaglandin PGFia \n7. A patient with a positive fecal blood test is referred to the gas\u00ad\ntroenterology clinic. He is apparently taking large amounts of \nan unidentified drug that inhibits platelet activity. Which of \nthe following is taken orally and directly and reversibly inhibits \nplatelet cyclooxygenase? \n(A) Alprostadil \n(B) Aspirin \n(C) Ibuprofen \n(D) Leukotriene LTC4 \n(E) Misoprostol \n(F) Prednisone \n(G) Prostacyclin \n(H) Zafirlukast \n(I) Zileuton \n8.

Aspirin and zileuton rarely cause diarrhea. LTB4 is a chemo\u00ad\ntactic factor. Famotidine is an H2 blocker that does not cause \ndiarrhea (see Chapter 16). Misoprostol, a PGE1 analog with \nprotective effects on gastric mucosa, increases gastrointestinal \nand uterine motility. It is sometimes used as part of an aborti\u00ad\nfacient. The answer is D. \n2. Hydrocortisone and other corticosteroids inhibit phospho\u00ad\nlipase. Ibuprofen and indomethacin inhibit cyclooxygenase \nreversibly, whereas zileuton inhibits lipoxygenase. Because \naspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase irreversibly, its action is more \neffective in platelets, which lack the ability to synthesize new \nenzyme, than in the endothelium. Aspirin does not block \nprostaglandin receptors. The answer is A. \n3. Prostacyclin (PGiz) is a very potent vasodilator. Acecylcho\u00ad\nline and bradykinin cause generalized vasodilation and many \nother undesirable effects; they are not useful in pulmonary or \nsystemic hypertension. PGFia and thromboxane are vasocon\u00ad\nstrictors. The answer is D. \n4. Although serotonin and, in some species, histamine may \ncause uterine stimulation, these amines are not derived from \nmembrane lipid. Similarly, oxytocin causes uterine contrac\u00ad\ntion, but it is a peptide hormone released from the posterior \npituitary. Prostacyclin relaxes the uterus (Table 18-1). The \nanswer is D. \n5. See Figure 18-1. Phospholipase A2 converts membrane phos\u00ad\npholipid to arachidonic acid. Cyclooxygenases convert ara\u00ad\nchidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-1 products appear to \nbe important in normaf physiologic processes. Lipoxygenase \nis the enzyme responsible for the production of leukotrienes \nfrom arachidonic acid in inflammatory cells. The answer is D. \n6. Infants with great vessel transposition pump venous blood to the \naorta and oxygenated blood back to the lungs. Therefore, they \nrequire surgical correction as soon as they are strong enough \nto withstand the procedure. While awaiting surgery, they are \ndependent on a patent ductus aneriosus to allow some oxygen\u00ad\nated blood to flow from the left ventricle via the pulmonary \nartery and ductus to the aorta. The ductus can be prevented \nfrom closing by infusing the vasodilator PGE1\u2022 (Note that aspi\u00ad\nrin is contraindicated in this condition because it reduces the \nproduction of endogenous PGE1 .) The answer is D. \n7. Aspirin is a direct but irreversible inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. \nNSAIDs other than aspirin (such as ibuprofen) are reversible \ninhibitors of COX. Conicosteroids reduce the synthesis of \ncyclooxygenase. The answer is C. \n8. The leukotriene C and D series are major eicosanoid com\u00ad\nponents of SRS-A. Leukotriene LTB4 is a chemotactic eico\u00ad\nsanoid. The answer is D. \n9. When cyclooxygenase is blocked, leukotrienes may be pro\u00ad\nduced in increased amounts by diversion of prostaglandin \nprecursors into the lipoxygenase pathway (Figure 18-1). In \npatients with aspirin hypersensitivity, this might precipitate \nthe bronchoconstriction often observed in this condition. \nThe answer is D. \nIO. Zileuton blocks the synthesis of leukotrienes. Montdukast \nand zafirlukast block LTD4 receptors. The answer is E. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The \nSkill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nEFFECTS OF NO \nA. Smooth Muscle \nNO is a powerful vasod.ilator in all vascular beds and a potent \nrelaxant in most other smooth muscle tissues, for example, erec\u00ad\ntile tissue. The mechanism of this effect involves activation of \nsoluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC, Figure 19-1) and the synthesis of \ncyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This cGMP, in turn, \nfacilitates the dephosphorylation and inactivation of myosin light \nchains, which results in relaxation of smooth muscle (see Figure \n12-3). NO plays a physiologic role in erectile tissue function, in \nwhich smooth muscle relaxation is required to bring about the \ninflux of blood that causes erection. NO appears to be a patho\u00ad\nphysiologic contributor to hypotension in septic shock. Riociguat indirectly increases NO effects. This first-in-its-class \ndrug binds to and activates sGC and increases its affinity for NO. \nThis results in an increased production of cG MP. It is orally active, \nhas a half-life of 5-10 h, and has additive effects with nitrates and \nother NO donors. It causes fetal damage and is contraindicated in \npregnancy . \nB. Cell Adhesion \nNO has effects on cell adhesion that result in reduced platelet \naggregation and reduced neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothe\u00ad\nlium. The latter effect is probably due to reduced expression of \nadhesion molecules, for example, integrins, by endothelial cdls. \nC. Inflammation \nTissue injury causes NO synthesis, and NO appears to facilitate \ninflammation both directly and through the stimulation of pros\u00ad\ntaglandin synthesis by cyclooxygenase 2. NO, acting together \nwith superoxide, generates peroxynitrite, a potent highly reactive \noxidant. \nD. Other Effects \nSome evidence suggests that NO may act as a neurotransmitter. \nNO also may be involved in some types of apoptosis and cdl death \nand in host reactions to parasites. Excessive concentrations of NO \n(eg, from inhaled NO or from nitrites) convert hemoglobin to \nmethemoglobin and may result in hypoxia. \nCLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF NO \nMODULATORS \nAlthough inhibitors of NO synthesis are of great research inter\u00ad\nest, none are currently in clinical use. NO can be inactivated \nby heme and hemoglobin, but application of this approach is \ninvestigational. \nIn contrast, drugs that activate endogenous NO synthesis and \ndonors of the molecule were in use long before NO was discov\u00ad\nered and continue to be very important in clinical medicine. The \ncardiovascular applications of nitroprusside (see Chapter 11) and \nthe nitrates and nitrites (see Chapter 12) have been discussed. The \ntreatment of preeclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, and acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome are currently under clinical investi\u00ad\ngation. Early results from pulmonary disease studies appear prom\u00ad\nising, and one preparation of NO gas (INO.mu) is approved for \nuse in neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure and adults with \npulmonary hypertension. Riociguat is also approved for use in \npulmonary arterial hypertension. It is given orally and metabolized \nin the liver. \nPreclinical studies suggest that chronic use of NO donor drugs \nor dietary supplementation with arginine may assist in slowing \natherosclerosis, especially in grafted organs. In contrast, acute \nrejection of grafts may involve up regulation of NOS enzymes, and \ninhibition of these enzymes may prolong graft survival. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

(Recall that the blood pressure\u00ad\nJowering action of IX:2 agonists is mediated by actions in the \nCNS, not in the vessels.) Conversely, ~2 receptors activate ade\u00ad\nnylyl cyclase via G, and increase cAMP, resulting in relaxation. \nIn addition to these, receptors for many vasoactive peptides \nare found in vessels (see Chapter 17). \nD List 2 drugs that spontaneously or enzymatically break down in the body to release NO. \nD Describe the effect of riociguat in pulmonary hypertension"

It is asso\u00ad\nciated with neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation, \nis poorly reversible with bronchodilators, and is less responsive to \ncorticosteroids than asthma. \nSTRATEGIES OF ASTHMA THERAPY \nAcute bronchospasm must be treated promptly and relieved with \nbronchodilators (\"reliever\" drugs). B~ agonists, muscarinic \nantagonists, and theophylline and its derivatives are available for \nthis indication. Long-term preventive treatment requires control \nof the inflammatory process in the airways with \"controller\" drugs. \nThe most important anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of \nchronic asthma are the cortic:ost.eroids. Long-acting ~ agonists \n(LABAs) can improve the response to corticosteroids. Antibodies \nagainst IgE and certain interleukins are also used in chronic ther\u00ad\napy. The leukotriene antagonists have effects on both broncho\u00ad\nconstriction and inflammation but are used only for prophylaxis. \nNasal oxygen is basic therapy for acute bronchospasm of any cause.

AC, adenylyl cyclase; PDE, phosphodiesterase. \nBETA-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONISTS \nA. Prototypes and Pharmacokinetics \nThe most important sympathomimetics used to reverse asth\u00ad\nmatic bronchoconstriction are the direct-acting ~-sdective ago\u00ad\nnists (see Chapter 9). The nonselective agonist, epinephrine, is \nalso available but because of its p1 and a-agonist effects, is not \nrecommended. Indirect-acting sympathomimetics, for example, \nephedrine, were once used, but they are now obsolete for this \napplication. Of the selective direct-acting agents, albuterol, ter\u00ad\nbutaline, and metaproterenol0 are short-acting and are the most \nimportant in the United States for the relief of acute broncho\u00ad\nspasm. Salmeterol, formoterol, indacaterol, and vilanterol are \nLABAs, but indacaterol and vilanterol are currently approved only \nfor COPD. Beta agonists are given almost exclusively by inhala\u00ad\ntion, usually from pressurized aerosol canisters but occasionally \nby nebulizer. The inhalational route decreases the systemic dose \n(and adverse effects) while delivering an effective dose locally to \nthe airway smooth muscle. The short-acting drugs have durations \nof action of 4 h or less; salmeterol, formoterol, indacaterol, and \nvilanterol act for 12-24 h. \nB. Mechanism and Effects \nBeta-adrenoceptor agonists stimulate adenylyl cyclase (via the \nPradrcnoceptor-G,-coupling protein-adcnylyl cyclase pathway) \nand increase cyclic adenosine monophosphatc (cAMP) in smooth \nmuscle cells (Figure 20-2}. The increase in cAMP results in a pow\u00ad\nerful bronchodilator response. \nC. Clinical Use and Toxicity \nSympathomimetics are first-line therapy in acute asthma. Shoner\u00ad\nacting sympathomimetics (albuterol, mctaprotcrenol, terbutaline) are \n\u2022oo not confuse mecaproterenol, a J3i agonist, with metoprolol, a ~1 blocker. the~ of choice for acute episodes ofbronchospasm. Their effects \nlast for 4 h or less, and they are not effi:ctive for prophylaxis. The long\u00ad\nacting agents (salmeterol, formoterol) should be used for prophylaxis, \nin which their 12-h duration of action is useful. They should not be \nused for acute episodes because their onset of action is too slow. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, used alone, LABAs increase asthma mortality, whereas in \ncombination with corticosteroids, they improve control. In almost all \npatients, the shorter-acting P agonists arc the most effective bronch<>\u00ad\ndilators available and arc lifesaving for acute asthma. Many patients \nwith COPD also benefit, although the risk of toxicity is increased in \nthis condition. \nSkeletal muscle tremor is a common adverse J3:i effect. Beta2 \nselectivity is relative. At high clinical dosage, these agents have sig\u00ad\nnificant P1-agonist effects. Even when they are given by inhalation, \nsome cardiac effect (tachycardia) is common. Other adverse effects \nare rare. When the agents are used excessivdy, arrhythmias and \ntremor arc more frequent. Loss of responsiveness (tolerance, tachy\u00ad\nphylaxis) is an unwanted result of prolonged use of the short-acting \nsympathomimetics. Patients with COPD often have concurrent \ncardiac disease and may have arrhythmias even at normal dosage. \nSKILL KEEPER: SYMPATHOMIMETICS VS \nANTIMUSCARINICS IN ASTHMA \n(SEE CHAPTERS 8 AND 9) \nThe sympathomimetic bronchodi/ators are drugs of choice \nin acute asthma.

            "Text": "176 PART IV Drugs with Important Actions on Smooth Muscle \nMETHYLXANTHINES \nA. Prototypes and Pharmacokinetics \nThe methylxanthines are purine derivatives. Three major methyl\u00ad\nxanthines are found in plants and provide the stimulant effects of \nthree common beverages: ca\u00a3&in.e (in coffee), theophylline (tea), \nand theobromine (cocoa). Theophylline is the only member of \nthis group that has been important in the treatment of asthma. \nThis drug and several analogs are orally active and available as \nvarious salts and as the base. Oral theophylline is available in both \nprompt-release and slow-release forms. Theophylline is eliminated \nby P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Clearance varies \nwith age (highest in young adolescents), smoking status (higher in \nsmokers), and concurrent use of other drugs that inhibit or induce \nhepatic enzymes. \nB. Mechanism of Action and Effects \nThe methylxanthines inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE), the \nenzyme that degrades cAMP to AMP (Figure 20-2), and thus \nincrease cAMP. This anti-PDE effect, however, requires high \nconcentrations of the drug. Several isoforms of PDE have been \nidentified; PDE3 appears to be the primary form responsible fur \nmethylxanthine-induced bronchodilation, while PDE4 may be \nresponsible for inhibition of inflammatory cells. Methylxanthines \nalso block adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) \nand elsewhere, but a relation between this action and the broncho\u00ad\ndilating effect has not been clearly established. It is possible that \nbronchodilation is caused by a third as yet unrecognized action. \nIn asthma, bronchodilation is the most important therapeu\u00ad\ntic action of theophylline. Increased strength of contraction of \nthe diaphragm has been demonstrated in some patients, an effect \nparticularly useful in COPD. Other effects of therapeutic doses \ninclude CNS stimulation, cardiac stimulation, vasodilation, a \nslight increase in blood pressure (probably caused by the release \nof norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves), diuresis, and increased \ngastrointestinal motility. \nC. Cllnlcal Use and Toxicity \nThe major clinical use of methylxanthines is asthma and COPD. \nSlow-release theophylline (for control of nocturnal asthma) is the \nmost commonly used methylxanthine. Aminophylline is a salt of \ntheophylline for intravenous administration . Ro8umilut, an oral, \nnonpurine, more selective PDE4 inhibitor, has been approved for \nuse in CO PD. Another methylxanthine derivative, pentoDfylline, \nis promoted as a remedy for intermittent claudication; this effect is \nsaid to result from decreased viscosity of the blood. Of course, the \nnonmedical use of the methylxanthines in coffee, tea, and cocoa is \nfar greater, in total quantities consumed, than the medical uses of \nthe drugs. Two cups of strong coffee are said to contain enough \nmethylxanthine drug to produce measurable bronchodilation. \nThe common adverse effects of methylxanthines include gastro\u00ad\nintestinal distress, tremor, and insomnia. Severe nausea and vom\u00ad\niting, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures may result \nfrom overdosage. Very large overdoses (eg, in suicide attempts) are potentially lethal because of arrhythmias and seizures. Beta \nblockers are useful in reversing severe cardiovascular toxicity from \ntheophylline. \nMUSCARINIC ANTAGONISTS \nA. Prototypes and Pharmacoldnetlcs \nAtropine and other naturally occurring belladonna alkaloids were \nused for many years in the treatment of asthma but have been \nreplaced by ipratropiu.m, a quaternary antimuscarinic agent \ndesigned for aerosol use (see Chapter 8). This drug is delivered to \nthe airways by pressurized aerosol and has little systemic action. \nTiotropiu.m, adidiniu.m, umedidiniu.m, and glycopyrrolate are \nanalogs approved fur use in COPD. \nB. Mechanism of Action and Effects \nWhen given by aerosol, these drugs competitively block musca\u00ad\nrinic M3 receptors in the airways and effectively prevent bron\u00ad\nchoconstriction mediated by vagal discharge. If given systemically \n(not an approved use), these drugs are indistinguishable from \nother short-acting muscarinic blockers. \nMuscarinic antagonists reverse bronchoconstriction in some \nasthma patients (especially children) and in many patients with \nCOPD. They have no effect on the chronic inflammatory aspects \nof asthma. \nC. Cllnlcal Use and Toxicity \nInhaled antimuscarinic agents are useful in one third to two thirds \nof asthmatic patients; ~2 agonists are effective in almost all. For \nacute bronchospasm, therefore, the ~ agonists are usually pre\u00ad\nferred. However, in COPD, which is often associated with acute \nepisodes ofbronchospasm, the antimuscarinic agents may be more \neffective and less toxic than ~ agonists. \nBecause these agents are delivered directly to the airway and \nare minimally absorbed, systemic effects are small. When given in \nexcessive dosage, minor atropine-like toxic effects may occur (see \nChapter 8). In contrast to the ~ agonists, muscarinic antagonists \ndo not cause tremor or arrhythmias. \nCORTICOSTEROIDS \nA. Prototypes and Pharmacoldnetlcs \nAll the corticosteroids are potentially beneficial in severe asthma \n(see Chapter 39). However, because of their toxicity, systemic \n(oral) corticosteroids (usually prednisone) are used chronically \nonly when other therapies are unsuccessful. In contrast, local \naerosol administration of surface-active corticosteroids (eg, bedo\u00ad\nmethasone, budesonide, deumethasone, Ounisolide, Outica\u00ad\nsone, mometasone) is relatively safe, and inhaled corticosteroids \nhave become common first-line therapy for individuals with mod\u00ad\nerate to severe asthma. Important intravenous corticosteroids for \nstatus asthmaticus include prednitolone (the active metabolite of \nprednisone) and hydrocortisone (cortisol). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Mechanism of Action and Effects \nCorticosteroids reduce the release of arachidonic acid from mem\u00ad\nbrane lipids by phospholipase A2 and inhibit the expre~ion of \nCOX-2, the inducible form of cyclooxygenase (see Chapter 18). \nConcentrations of prostaglandins and leukotrienes are reduced. \nIt has also been suggested that the glucocorticoid conicosteroids \nincrease the responsiveness of ~ adrenoceptors in the airway and \nthey probably act by other mechanisms as well. \nGlucocorticoids bind to intracellular receptors and activate glu\u00ad\ncocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the nucleus, resulting in \nsynthesis of substances that prevent the full expre~ion of inflam\u00ad\nmation and allergy. See Chapter 39 for details. Reduced activity \nof phospholipase A2 is thought to be particularly important in \nasthma because the leukotrienes that result from phospholipase\u00ad\nstimulated eicosanoid synthesis are extremely potent bronchocon\u00ad\nstrictors and may also participate in the late inflammatory response \n(Figure 20-3). \nC. Clinical Use and Toxicity \nInhaled glucocorticoids are now considered appropriate (even \nfor children) in most cases of moderate asthma that are not fully \nresponsive to aerosol P agonists. It is believed that such early use \nmay prevent the severe, progressive inflammatory changes char\u00ad\nacteristic of long-standing asthma.

The bronchial late response in the patho\u00ad\ngenesis of asthma and its modulation by therapy, Ann Allergy 1985 \nDeG55(6}:857-862.} belief that steroids should be used only in severe refractory asthma. \nIn such cases of severe asthma, patients are usually hospitalized \nand stabilized on daily systemic prednisone and then switched to \ninhaled or alternate-day oral therapy before discharge. In status \nasthmaticus, parenteral steroids are lifesaving and apparently act \nmore promptly than in ordinary asthma. Patients with COPD \ntend to be more resistant to the beneficial effects of steroids. Their \nmechanism of action in this condition is not fully understood. \n(See Chapter 39 for other uses.) \nFrequent aerosol administration of glucocorticoids can occa\u00ad\nsionally result in a small degree of adrenal suppre~ion, but this \nis rarely significant. More commonly, deposition of inhaled drug \ndroplets in the pharynx causes changes in oropharyngeal flora that \nresult in candidiasis. (Candidiasis can be controlled with a topical \nmouthwash containing clotrimazole or a similar antifungal agent.) \nIf oral corticosteroid therapy is required, adrenal suppression can \nbe reduced by using alternate-day therapy (ie, giving the drug in \nslightly higher dosage every other day rather than smaller doses \nevery day). The major systemic toxicities of the glucoconicoids \ndescribed in Chapter 39 are much more likely to occur when sys\u00ad\ntemic treatment is required for more than 2 weeks, as in severe \nrefractory asthma. Regular use of inhaled steroids does cause mild \nslowing of growth in children, but these children eventually reach \nfull predicted adult stature. \nLEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS \nThese drugs interfere with the synthesis or the action of the leukot\u00ad\nrienes (see also Chapter 18). Although their value has been estab\u00ad\nlished, they are not as effective as corticosteroids in severe asthma. \nA. Leukotriene Receptor Blockers \nMontdukast and zafirlukast arc antagonists at the LTD4 leu\u00ad\nkotriene receptor (see Table 18-1). The LTE4 receptor is also \nblocked. These drugs arc orally active and have been shown to \nbe effective in preventing exercise-, antigen-, and aspirin-induced \nbronchospasm. They are not recommended for acute episodes \nof asthma. Toxicity is generally low. Rare reports of eosinophilic \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) have appeared, but an \nassociation with these drugs appears doubtful. \nB. Lipoxygenase Inhibitor \nZilcuton is an orally active drug that selectively inhibits \n5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic \nacid to leukotrienes. The drug is effective in preventing exercise-, \naspirin-, and antigen-induced bronchospasm. The toxicity of \nzilcuton includes occasional elevation of liver enzymes, and this \ndrug is therefore less popular than the receptor blockers. \nCROMOLYN & NEDOCROMIL \nA.

They are given by aerosol fur asthma \nbut are now rarely used in the United States for that indication . \nCromolyn is currently available over the counter fur other allergic \nconditions. \nB. Mechanism of Action and Effects \nThe mechanism of action of these drugs is poorly understood but \nmay involve a decrease in the release of mediators (such as leukot\u00ad\nrienes and histamine) from mast cells. The drugs have no bron\u00ad\nchodilator action but can prevent bronchoconstriction caused by \na challenge with antigen to which the patient is allergic. Cromo\u00ad\nlyn and nedocromil are capable of preventing both early and late \nresponses to challenge (Figure 20-3). \nBecause they are not absorbed from the site of administration, \ncromolyn and nedocromil have only local effects. When adminis\u00ad\ntered orally, cromolyn has some efficacy in preventing food allergy. \nSimilar actions have been demonstrated after local application in \nthe conjunctiva and the nasopharyn:x: for allergic IgE-mediated \nreactions in these tissues. \nC. Cllnlcal Uses and Toxicity \nAsthma (especially in children) was the most important use for \ncromolyn and nedocromil. Nasal and eyedrop formulations of cro\u00ad\nmolyn are available for hay fever, and an oral formulation is used \nfor food allergy. \nCromolyn and nedocromil may cause cough and irritation of \nthe airway when given by aerosol. Rare instances of drug allergy \nhave been reported. \nANTl-IGE ANTIBODIES \nOmalizumab is a humanized marine monoclonal antibody to \nhuman IgE. Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE but docs not \nactivate IgE already bound to its receptor and thus does not pro\u00ad\nvoke mast cell dcgranulation. It thus prevents activation by asthma \ntrigger antigens and subsequent release of inflammatory media\u00ad\ntors. Approved for the prophylactic management of severe asthma, \nthis drug is very expensive and must be administered parcnterally. \nSeveral additional antibodies have been approved. These include \nbemalizumab, which targets the 115 receptor; and mepolizumab \nand resli111mab, which target interleukin IL-5 itself. Dupilumab, \nwhich targets the receptor that binds IL-4a and IL-13, is \ninvestigational. \nSTRATEGIES OF COPD TREATMENT \nCOPD responds to bronchodilators, including ~2 agonists \nand muscarinic antagonists, but is less responsive to corticoste\u00ad\nroids than asthma. A combination long-acting ~2 agonist with a \nlong-acting muscarinic blocker, given by inhalation, is often pre\u00ad\nferred for prophylaxis . Some COPD patients tolerate muscarinic antagonists better than ~ agonists, perhaps because COPD is \noften accompanied by cardiac disease and ~ agonists may trigger \narrhythmias. Theophylline or roflumilast may be useful. Because \nbacterial respiratory infections often precipitate exacerbations, \nantibiotic therapy is more important in COPD than in asthma. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

Theophylline does not ordinarily cause headache or pos\u00ad\ntural hypotension. Nitroglycerin does not cause direct car\u00ad\ndiac stimulation but does evoke a compensatory sympathetic \nreflex. Histamine does not cause bronchodilation. The answer \nis B. \n2. Albuterol is a ~2-sdective receptor agonist, but in moderate to \nhigh doses it produces ~1 cardiac effects as well as ~-mediated \nsmooth and skeletal muscle effects. It does not cause diuresis. \nThe answer is A. \n3. Chronic oral corticosteroids, eg. prednisone, have impor\u00ad\ntant toxicities (see Chapter 39). However, they are unlikely \nto cause oral fungal infection. In contrast, topical, inhaled \nsteroids, eg, beclomethasone, are associated with this adverse \neffect because the inhalation route results in high concentra\u00ad\ntions in the oropharynx. The answer is B. \n4. Although extremely important in severe chronic asthma and \nstatus asthmaticus , corticosteroids do not have a demonstra\u00ad\nble direct bronchodilator action. Salmeterol has a slow onset \nof action and is not suitable for an acute asthmatic attack. \nIpratropium has bronchodilator action but is not the drug of \nfirst choice. The answer is A. \n5. Histamine does not appear to play a significant role in asthma, \nand antihistaminic drugs, even in high doses, are of little or \nno value. Antigen avoidance is well established. Blockade of \nleukotriene receptors with montelukast or zafirlukast, inhibi\u00ad\ntion of phospholipase with corticosteroids, and inhibition of \ncytokines are also useful. The answer is B. \n6.

The answer is G. \n9. Salmeterol is a ~rselective agonist that has a slow onset and \nlong duration of action. Used alone, it increases asthma mor\u00ad\ntality, but in combination with inhaled corticosteroids pro\u00ad\nphylactic use improves asthma control. The answer is H. \n10. Zileuton is an inhibitor of the lipoxygenase enzyme involved \nin the synthesis of leukotrienes. Montelukast and zafirlukast \nare leukotriene antagonists at the leukotriene receptor. The \nanswer is D."

Most of these drugs a.ct \nby changing ion Bow through ttansmemb.rane channels of ne.rve cells. \nTransmitter rettptake uanspon:as constitute a second class of drug \ntargets, especially fur antidepressant agents. Inhibition of acetylcho\u00ad\nline metabolism. is the major action of the drugs currently approved \nfur use in Alzheimet disease and y..aminobutyric acid (GABA) metab\u00ad\nolism is inhibited by an anticonvulsant agent.

Mic.roglia have also been shown \nto \"prune\" new:onal netwotks in the normal devdopment of the CNS \nand pos&bly in Alzheimet disease and schiwphrenia. \nA. Types of Ion Channels \nIon channels of neuronal membranes are of two major types: volt\u00ad\nage gated.and ligand gated (Figure21-l). Voltage-gated ion chan\u00ad\nnels mpond to change& in membrane potential. They are fuund in \nhigh concentration on the axons ofnerve cells and include the sodiwn \nchannels .responsible fur action potential propagation. Cell bodies, \naxon terminals, and dendrite& have voltage\u00abmitive ion channels fur \naodiwn, potassium, and calciwn. Ligand-gated ion channels, also \ncalled ionotropic receptors, respond to chemical neurotransmitters \nthat bind to receptor subunits present in their macromolecular struc\u00ad\nture. Neurotr.ansmittcrs also bind to G-protein-coupled receptors \n(metabotropic receptors) that can modulate voltage-gattd ion chan\u00ad\nnels.

Types of Reaptor-Chann1I Coupllng \nIn the case of ligand-gated ion channels, activation (or inhibition) \nis initiated by the interaction between chemical neurottansmit\u00ad\nteB and their receptors (Figure 21-1). Coupling may be through \na receptor that acts directly on the cbannd protein (panel B), \nthrough a receptor that is coupled to the ion channel through a \nG protein (panel C). or through a receptor coupled to a G pro\u00ad\ntein that modulate5 the furmation of diffusible second me5sengers, \nincluding cyclic adenosine monopbospbate (cAMP), inositol tri\u00ad\nsphosphate (IP3), and diacylglycerol (DAG), which secondarily \nmodulate ion channels (panel D). \nC. Role of the Ion Cumant Carried by the Ch\u2022nnel \nExcitatory (depolarizing) poruynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are usup \nally generated by the opening of sodium or calcium channels. In \nsome synapses, similar depolarizing potentials result from the clor\u00ad\ning of potassium channels. Inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) postsynp \naptic potentials (IPSPs) are wually generated by the opening of \npotassium or chloride channels. For example, activation of postp \nsynaptic metabotropic receptors increases the efflux of potassium. \nPresynaptic inhibition can occur via a decrease in calcium influx \nelicited by activation of metabotropic receptors. \nSITES & MECHANISMS OF \nDRUG ACTION \nA small number of neurophannacologic agents exert their effects \nthrough direct interactions with molecular components of ion \nchannels on axons.

However, the effects of most therapeu\u00ad\ntically important CNS drugs are exerted mainly at synapses. Pos\u00ad\nsible mechanisms are indicated in Figure 21-2. Thus, as noted \nearlier, drugs may act presynaptically to alter the synthesis, storage, \nrelease, reuptake, or metabolism of transmitter chemicals. Other \ndrugs can activate or block both pre-and postsynaptic receptors \nfor specific transmitters or can interfere with the actions of second \nmessengers. The selectivity of CNS drug action is largely based on \nthe fact that different groups of neurons use different neurotrans\u00ad\nmitters and that they are segregated into networks that subserve \ndifferent CNS functions. \nDrugs that alter transmitter reuptake (site 6 in Figure 21-2) are \nespecially important for 5-HT, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic \nsynapses. Serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and \nNET, respectively) are the targets of antidepressants , while NET \nand the dopamine reuptake transporter are the targets of amphet\u00ad\namines and cocaine. \nA few neurotoxic substances damage or kill nerve cells. For \nexample, l-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) \nis cytotoxic to neurons of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. CHAPTER 21 Introduction to CNS Pharmacology 185 \nROLE OF CNS ORGANIZATION \nThe CNS contains two types of neuronal systems: hierarchical \nand diffuse. \nA. Hierarchical Systems \nThese systems are delimited in their anatomic distribution and \ngenerally contain large myelinated, rapidly conducting fibers. \nHierarchical systems control major sensory and motor functions. \nThe major excitatory transmitters in these systems are aspartate \nand glutamate. These systems also include numerous small inhibi\u00ad\ntory interneurons, which use GABA or glycine as transmitters. \nDrugs that affect hierarchical systems often have profound effects \non the overall excitability of the CNS. \nB. Diffuse Systems \nDiffuse or nonspecific systems are broadly distributed, with single \ncells frequently sending branches to many different areas. The \naxons are fine and branch repeatedly to form synapses with many \ncells. Axons commonly have periodic enlargements (varicosities} \nthat contain transmitter vesicles. The transmitters in diffuse sys\u00ad\ntems are often amines (norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) or \npeptides that commonly exert actions on metabotropic receptors. \nDrugs that affect these systems often have marked effects on such \nCNS functions as attention, appetite, and emotional states. \nTRANSMITTERS AT CENTRAL SYNAPSES \nA. Criteria for Transmitter Status \nTo be accepted as a neurotransmitter, a candidate chemical must \n(1) be present in higher concentration in the synaptic area than in \nother areas (ie, must be localized in appropriate areas), (2) be released \nby electrical or chemical stimulation via a calcium-dependent \nmechanism, and (3) produce the same sort of postsynaptic response \nthat is seen with physiologic activation of the synapse (ie, must \nexhibit synaptic mimicry). Table 21-1 lists the most important \nchemicals currently accepted as neurotransmitters in the CNS. \nB. Glutamlc Acid \nGlutamic acid is the mwt important excitatory transmitter \nin the CNS: most neurons in the brain are excited by glutamic \nacid. High concentrations of glutamic acid in synaptic vesicles \nare achieved by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). \nBoth ionotropic and metabotropic receptors have been charac\u00ad\nterized. There are three major subtypes of glutamate-responsive \nchannels. The channel associated with the N-methyl-o-aspartate \n(NMDA) receptor mediates increased Na+, K', and Ca2+ current. \nThe NMDA receptor is blocked. by phencyc:lidine (PCP) and ket\u00ad\namine and its channel conductance is correspondingly decreased. \nNMDA receptors appear to play a role in synaptic plasticity related \nto learning and memory via the long-term potentiation (LTP) \nphenomenon. Mcmantine is an NMDA antagonist approved for \ntreatment of Alzheimer dementia. Excessive activation ofNMDA"

            "Text": "C. GABA and Glycine \nGABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter mediating \nIPSPs in neurons in the brain; it is also imponant in the spinal \ncord. ~ receptor activation opens chloride ion channds. \nGABAii receptors (activated by badoko., a centrally acting muscle \nrelaxant) are coupled to G proteins that either open a potassium \nchannd that is shared with 5-HT1A receptors, or close calcium \nchannels. Fast IPSPs are blocked by GABAA receptor antagonists, \nand slow IPSPs are blocked by GABA 8 receptor antagonists. Drugs \nthat influence GABAA receptor systems include sedative-hypnotics \n(eg, barbiturat.cs, benzodiazepines, zolpidem) and some anti\u00ad\nconvulsants (eg, gabapentin, tiagabine, vigabatrin). Glycine \nreceptors, which are more numerous in the cord than in the brain, \nare blocked by strychnine, a spinal convulsant. \nD. Acetylchollne \nApproximately 5% of brain neurons have receptors for acetylcho\u00ad\nline (ACh). Most CNS responses to ACh are mediated by a large \nfamily of G-protein-coupled muscarinic M 1 receptors that lead to \nslow excitation when activated. The ionic mechanism of slow exci\u00ad\ntation involves a decrease in membrane potassium permeability . Of \nthe nicotinic receptors present in the CNS (they are less common \nthan muscarinic receptors), those on the Renshaw cells activated \nby motor axon collaterals in the spinal cord are the best charac\u00ad\nterized. Drugs affecting the activity of cholinergic systems in the \nbrain include the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used in Alzheimer \ndisease (eg, rivastigmine) and the muscarinic blocking agents used \nin parkinsonism (eg, benztropine). \nE.Dopamine \nDopamine exerts slow inhibitory actions at synapses in specific \nneuronal systems, commonly via G-protein-coupled activation of \npotassium channels (postsynaptic) or inhibition of calcium chan\u00ad\nnels (presynaptic). The D2 receptor is the main dopamine subtype \nin basal ganglia neurons, and it is widely distributed at the supra\u00ad\nspinal level. Dopaminergic pathwa}'li include the nigro-striatal, \nmesolimbic, and tuberoinfundibular tracts. In addition to the two \nreceptors listed in Table 21-1, three other dopamine receptor sub\u00ad\ntypes have been identified (D3, D4, and D5). Drugs that block \nthe activity of dopaminergic pathwa}'li include older antipsychotics \n(eg, chlorpromazine, haloperidol}, which may cause parkinsonian \nsymptoms. Drugs that increase synaptic dopaminergic activity \ninclude CNS stimulants (eg, amphetamine), and commonly used \nantiparkinsonism drugs (eg, levodopa). \nF. Norepinephrine \nNoradrenergic neuron cell bodies are mainly located in the brain \nstem and the lateral tegmental area of the pons. These neurons fan \nout broadly to provide most regions of the CNS with diffuse norad\u00ad\nrenergic input. Excitatory effects are produced by activation of a1 \nand ~1 receptors. Inhibitory effects are caused by activation of <Xi \nand ~2 receptors. Norepinephrine receptors appear to be involved \nin mood, appetite, and alertness. CNS stimulants (eg, amphet\u00ad\namines [used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD], \ncocaine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (eg, phenelzine), and CHAPTER 21 Introduction to CNS Pharmacology 187 \ntricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) are examples of drugs \nthat enhance the activity of noradrenergic pathwa}'li. \nG. Serotonin \nMost serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) pathways originate \nfrom cell bodies in the raphe or midline regions of the pons and \nupper brain stem; these pathways innervate most regions of the \nCNS. Multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified and, \nwith the exception of the 5-HT3 subtype, all are metabotropic. \n5-HT1A receptors and GABA8 receptors share the same potassium \nchannel. Serotonin can cause excitation or inhibition of CNS neu\u00ad\nrons depending on the receptor subtype activated. Both excitatory \nand inhibitory actions can occur on the same neuron if appropri\u00ad\nate receptors are present. Most of the agents used in the treatment \nof major depressive disorders affect serotonergic pathwa}'li to some \ndegree (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake \ninhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). The \nactions of some CNS stimulants and newer antipsychotic drugs \n(eg, olanzapine) also appear to be mediated via effects on seroto\u00ad\nnergic transmission. Reserpine, which may cause severe depression \nof mood, depletes vesicular stores of both serotonin and norepi\u00ad\nnephrine in CNS neurons. \nH. Peptide Transmitters \nMany peptides have been identified in the CNS, and some meet \nmost or all of the criteria for acceptance as neurotransmitters. The \nbest-defined peptides are the opioid peptides (IJ-end.orpbin, met\u00ad\nand leu-enkephalin, and dynorphin), which are distributed at all \nlevels of the neuraxis. Some of the important therapeutic actions \nof opioid analgesics (eg, morphine) are mediated via activation of \nreceptors for these endogenous peptides. Another peptide, sub\u00ad\nstance P, is a mediator of slow EPSPs in neurons involved in \nnociceptive sensory pathwa}'li in the spinal cord and brain stem. \nOrains are peptides associated with the sleep-wake cycle and \npromote wakefulness. Peptide transmitters differ from nonpep\u00ad\ntide transmitters in that (1) the peptides are synthesized in the cell \nbody and transported to the nerve ending via axonal transport, and \n(2) no reuptake or specific enzyme mechanisms have been identi\u00ad\nfied for terminating their actions. \nI. Endocannabinoids \nThese are widely distributed brain lipid derivatives (eg, 2-arachidonyl\u00ad\nglycerol) that bind to receptors for the cannabinoids found in \nmarijuana (see Chapter 60). They are synthesized and released \npostsynaptically after membrane depolarization but diffuse back\u00ad\nward (retrograde), acting presynaptically to decrease transmitter \nrelease, via their interaction with a specific cannabinoid receptor. \nJ. Other Transmitters \nHistamine receptors are widely distributed in the brain and \nappear to modulate arousal, appetite, and memory. Centrally act\u00ad\ning antihistamines have significant sedative and antimotion sick\u00ad\nness effects (see Chapter 16). Nittic oxide (NO) is not stored but \nsynthesized on demand. Nitric oxide synthase is found in several \ntypes of neurons but the role of NO in CNS function is poorly"

Certain drugs {eg, benzodiazepines) facilitate neuronal \nmembrane inhibition by actions at specific receptors. \nA. Benzodiazepines \nGABA is the transmitter most associated with inhibition in the \nCNS and the GABAA receptor mediates this effect. Receptors for \nbenzodiazepines {BZ receptors) are located on the GABAA recep\u00ad\ntor molecule and thus are present in many brain regions, includ\u00ad\ning the thalamus, limbic structures, and the cerebral cortex. The \nGABAA receptor-chloride ion channel macromolecular complex \nis a pentameric structure assembled from 5 subunits, each with 4 \ntransmembrane domains. A major isoform of the GABAA recep\u00ad\ntor consists of two a1, 2 Pi, and I y2 subunits. In this isoform, \nthe binding site for benzodiazepines is between an a1 and the y2 \nsubunit. However, benzodiazepines also bind to other GABAA \nreceptor isoforms that contain exi. a3, and <ls subunits. Binding \nof benzodiazepines facilitates the inhibitory actions of GABA, \nwhich are exerted through increased chloride ion conductance \n(Figure 22-1). GABAB receptors are coupled to potassium chan\u00ad\nnels; activation of these receptors, for example, by baclofen, opens \nthe channels and causes hyperpolarization . \nBenzodiazepines increase the frequency of GABA-mediated \nchloride ion channel opening. Flumazenil reverses the CNS \neffects of benzodiazepines and is classified as an antagonist at BZ \nreceptors. In contrast, certain P,.carbolines have a high affinity \nfor BZ receptors and can elicit anxiogenic and convulsant effects. \nThese drugs are classified as inverse agonist:s. \nB. Barbiturates \nBarbiturates depress neuronal activity in the midbrain reticular \nformation, facilitating and prolonging the inhibitory effects of \nGABA and glycine. Barbiturates also bind to multiple isoforms of \nthe GABAA receptor but at different sites from those with which \nbenzodiazepines interact. Their actions are not antagonized by flumazenil. Barbiturates increase the duration of GABA-mediated \nchloride ion channel opening. They may also block the excitatory \ntransmitter glutamic acid, and, at high concentration, sodium \nchannels. \ner \nGABA \nBenzodiazepines \nIntracellular \nFIGURE 22-1 A model of the GABA,. receptor-chloride ion \nchannel macromolecular complex.

GABA appears to interact at two sites between a and \nll subunits, triggering chlorlde channel opening with resulting mem\u00ad\nbrane hyperpolarization. Binding ofbenzodiazepines and the newer \nhypnotic drugs such as zolpldem occurs at a single site between a \nand 'Y subunits, facilitating the process of chloride ion channel open\u00ad\ning. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil also binds at this site \nand can reverse the hypnotic effects ofzolpidem. Note that these \nbinding sites are disti net from those of the barbiturates.

Other Drugs \nThe hypnotics zolpidem, weplon, and eszopiclone are not \nbenzodiazepines but appear to exen their CNS effects via interac\u00ad\ntion with certain benzodiazepine receptors, classified as BZ1 or (1)1 \nsubtypes. In contrast to benzodiazepines, these drugs bind more \nselectively, interacting only with GABAA receptor isoforms that \ncontain al subunits. Their CNS depressant effects can be antago\u00ad\nnized by flumazenil. Atypical drugs are discussed below. \nPHARMACODYNAMICS \nThe CNS effects of most sedative-hypnotics depend on dose, as \nshown in Figure 22-2. These effects range from sedation and relief \nof anxiety (anxiolysis), through hypnosis (facilitation of sleep), to \nanesthesia and coma. Depressant effects are additive when two or \nmore drugs are given together. The steepness of the dose-response \ncurve varies among drug groups; those with flatter curves, such as \nbenzodiazepines and the newer hypnotics (eg, zolpidem), are safer \nfor clinical use. \nA.Sedation \nSedative actions, with relief of anxiety, occur with all drugs in this \nclass. Anxiolysis is usually accompanied by some impairment of \npsychomotor functions, and behavioral disinhibition may also \noccur. In animals, most conventional sedative-hypnotics release \npunishment-suppressed behavior. \nB.Hypnosis \nSedative-hypnotics can promote sleep onset and increase the dura\u00ad\ntion of the sleep state. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration \nis usually decreased at high doses; a rebound increase in REM sleep \nmay occur on withdrawal from chronic drug use.

Anesthesia \nAt high doses of most older sedative-hypnotics, loss of conscious\u00ad\nness may occur, with amnesia and suppression of reflexes. Antero\u00ad\ngrade amnesia (inability to recall events that occur during the \ndrug's action) is more likely with benzodiazepines than with other \nsedative-hypnotics. Anesthesia can he produced by most barbitu\u00ad\nrates (eg, thiopental) and certain henzodiazepines (eg, midazolam). \nD. Antlconvulsant Actions \nSuppression of seizure activity occurs with high doses of most of \nthe barbiturates and some of the henzodiazepines, hut this is usu\u00ad\nally at the cost of marked sedation. Selective anticonvulsant action \n(ie, suppression of convulsions at doses that do not cause severe \nsedation) occurs with only a few of these drugs (eg, phenobarbi\u00ad\ntal, clonazepam). High doses ofintravenous diazepam, lorazepam, \nor phenobarbital are used in status epilepticus. In this condition, \nheavy sedation is desirable. \nE. Muscle Relaxation \nRelaxation of skeletal muscle occurs only with high doses of most \nsedative-hypnotics. However, diazepam is effective at sedative dose \nlevels for specific spasticity states, including cerebral palsy. Mepro\u00ad\nbamate also has some selectivity as a muscle relaxant. \nF. Medullary Depression \nHigh doses of conventional sedative-hypnotics, especially alcohols \nand barbiturates, can cause depression of medullary neurons, lead\u00ad\ning to respiratory arrest, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse. \nThese effects are the cause of death in suicidal overdose. \nSKILL KEEPER: LOADING DOSE \n(SEE CHAPTER 3) \nThree hours after ingestion of an unknown quantity of \ndiazepam, a patient was hospitalized and the drug concen\u00ad\ntration in the plasma was found to be 2 mg/L.

Cross-tolerance \nmay occur among different chemical subgroups. Psychological \ndependence occurs frequently with most sedative-hypnotics and is \nmanifested by the compulsive use of these drugs to reduce anxiety. \nPhysiologic dependence constitutes an altered state that leads to an \nabstinence syndrome (withdrawal state) when the drug is abruptly \ndiscontinued.

The dependence liability of zolpidem, \nzaleplon, and eszopiclone may be less than that of the benzodiaz\u00ad\nepines since withdrawal symptoms are minimal after their abrupt \ndiscontinuance. \nCLINICAL USES \nMost of these uses can be predicted from the pharmacodynamic \neffects outlined previously. \nA. Anxiety States \nBenzodiazepines are favored in the drug treatment of acute anxiety \nstates and for rapid control of panic attacks. Although it is dif\u00ad\nficult to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another, \nalprazolam and clonazepam have greater efficacy than other ben\u00ad\nzodiazepines in the longer term treatment of panic and phobic \ndisorders. There is increasing use of a different drug group, the \nnewer antidepressants, in the treatment of chronic anxiety states (see \nChapter 30). \nB. Sleep Disorders \nBenzodiazepines, including estazolam, flurazepam, and triazolam, \nhave been widely used in primary insomnia and for the man\u00ad\nagement of certain other sleep disorders. Lower doses should be \nused in older patients, who are often more sensitive to their CNS \ndepressant effects. More recently there has been increasing use of \nzolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone in insomnia, since they have \nrapid onset with minimal effects on sleep patterns and cause less \ndaytime cognitive impairment than benzodiazepines. Note that \nsedative-hypnotic drugs are not recommended for breathing\u00ad\nrelated sleep disorders, for example, sleep apnea. \nC. Other Uses \nThiopental was commonly used for the induction of anesthesia, \nand certain benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam, midazolam) are used \nas components of anesthesia protocols including those used in day \nsurgery. Special uses include the management of seizure disorders \n(eg, clonazepam, phenobarbital), bipolar disorder (eg, clonaz\u00ad\nepam), and treatment of muscle spasticity (cg, diazepam). Longer \nacting benzodiazepines (eg, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) are used \nin the management of withdrawal states in persons physiologically \ndependent on ethanol and other sedative-hypnotics. \nTOXICITY \nA. Psychomotor Dysfunction \nThis includes cognitive impairment, decreased psychomotor skills, \nand unwanted daytime sedation. These effects are particularly dan\u00ad\ngerous when driving or operating other machinery. These adverse \neffects are more common with benzodiazepines that have active \nmetabolites with long half-lives (eg, diazepam, flurazepam), but \ncan also occur after a single dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine \nsuch as triazolam. The dosage of a sedative-hypnotic should be CHAPTER22 Sedative-HypnoticDrugs 193 \nreduced in elderly patients, who are more susceptible to drugs that \ncause psychomotor dysfunction. In such patients excessive day\u00ad\ntime sedation has been shown to increase the risk of falls and frac\u00ad\ntures. Anterograde amnesia may also occur with benzodiazepines, \nespecially when used at high dosage, an action that forms the basis \nfor their criminal use in cases of \"date rape.\" Zolpidem and the \nnewer hypnotics cause modest day-after psychomotor depression \nwith few amnestic effects. However, all prescription drugs used as \nsleep aids may cause functional impairment, including \"sleep driv\u00ad\ning,\" defined as \"driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a \nsedative-hypnotic product, with no memory of the event.\" \nB. Additive CNS Depression \nAdditive depression occurs when sedative-hypnotics are used with \nother drugs in the class as well as with alcoholic beverages, first\u00ad\ngcneration antihistamines, antipsychotic drugs, opioid analgesics, \nand tricyclic antidepressants. This is the most common type of \ndrug interaction involving sedative-hypnotics. \nC. Overdosage \nOverdosage of sedative-hypnotic drugs causes severe respiratory \nand cardiovascular depression; these potentially lethal effects are \nmore likely to occur with alcohols, barbiturates, and carbamates \nthan with benzodiazepines or the newer hypnotics such as zolpi\u00ad\ndem. Management of intoxication requires maintenance of a pat\u00ad\nent airway and ventilatory support. Flumazenil may reverse CNS \ndepressant effects of benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zolpidem, and \nzaleplon but has no beneficial actions in overdosage with other \nsedative-hypnotics. \nD. Other Adverse Effects \nBarbiturates and carbamates (but not benzodiazepines, eszopi~ \nclone, zolpidem, or zaleplon) induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. \nThis enzyme induction may lead to multiple drug interactions. \nBarbiturates may also precipitate acute intermittent porphyria in \nsusceptible patients. Chloral hydrate may displace coumarins from \nplasma protein binding sites and increase anticoagulant effects. \nATYPICAL SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS \nA. Busplrone \nBuspirone is a selective anxiolytic, with minimal CNS depressant \neffects (it does not affect driving skills) and has no anticonvulsant \nor muscle relaxant properties. The drug interacts with the 5-HT lA \nsubclass of brain serotonin receptors as a partial agonist, but the \nprecise mechanism of its anxiolytic effect is unknown.

Only two of the drugs listed are used for insomnia, eszopi\u00ad\nclone and ramelteon. Eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem \nare related hypnotics that, though structurally different from \nbenzodiazepines, appear to have a similar mechanism of \naction. However, unlike benzodiazepines, these drugs are not \nused in seizures or in muscle spasticity states. Compared with \nbenzodiazepines, the newer hypnotics are less likdy to alter \nsleep patterns. Ramelteon activates melatonin receptors in the \nsuprachiasmatic nuclei; flumazenil does not reverse its effects. \nBuspirone is not a hypnotic! The answer is C. \n2. As a weak acid (pK. 7), phenobarbital will be more ionized \n(nonprotonated) in the urine at alkaline pH and less reab\u00ad\nsorbed in the renal tubule. Flumazenil is an antagonist at BZ \nreceptors and is used to reverse CNS depressant effects ofben\u00ad\nzodiazepines. The dose-response curve for benzodiazepines is \nflatter than that for barbiturates such as phenobarbital. The \nanswer is B. \n3. Buspirone is a selective anxiolytic with pharmacologic charac\u00ad\nteristics different from those of sedative-hypnotics. Buspirone \nhas minimal effects on cognition or memory; it is not addi\u00ad\ntive with ethanol in terms of CNS depression; tolerance is \nminimal; and it has no dependence liability. Buspirone is not \neffective in acute anxiety because it has a slow onset of action \n(-1 week). The answer is D. \n4. Benzodiazepines exert most of their CNS effects by increasing \nthe inhibitory effects of GABA, interacting with components \nof the GABAA receptor-chloride ion channel macromolecu\u00ad\nlar complex to increase the frequency of chloride ion channel CHAPTER22 Sedative-HypnoticDrugs 195 \nopening. Benzodiazepines do not affect GABA metabolism or \nrelease, and they do not interact directly with the binding site \nfor GABA. The answer is C. \n5. In elderly patients taking benzodiazepines, hypotension is far \nmore likely than an increase in blood pressure. Elderly patients \nare more prone to the CNS depressant effects of hypnotics; a \ndose reduction of 50% may still cause excessive sedation with \npossible ambulatory impairment. Additive CNS depression \noccurs commonly with drugs used in over-the-counter cold \nmedications, especially antihistamines, and rebound insom\u00ad\nnia can occur with abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines \nused as sleeping pills. Alcohol enhances psychomotor depres\u00ad\nsion and the amnestic effects of the benzodiazepines. The \nanswer is D. \n6. Flumazenil binds to the chloride channel macromolecular \ncomplex and competes with the benzodiazepines, eszopi\u00ad\nclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem. It does not reverse the action \nof barbiturates and has no effect on the antianxiety action of \nbuspirone. The answer is B. \n7. Alprazolam and clonazepam (not listed) are the most effective \nof the benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorders. \nEszopiclone, flurazepam, and ramelteon are used as hypnot\u00ad\nics. Propranolol is commonly used to attenuate excessive \nsympathomimetic activity in persons who suffer from perfor\u00ad\nmance anxiety (\"stage fright\"). The answer is A. \n8. Clonazepam and phenobarbital are both used in seizure disor\u00ad\nders. Chronic administration of phenobarbital (but not clon\u00ad\nazepam) increases the activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing \nenzymes, including several cytochrome P450 isozymes. This \ncan increase the rate of metabolism of drugs administered \nconcomitantly, resulting in decreases in the intensity and \nduration of their effects. The answer is D. \n9. The elimination of most benzodiazepines involves their \nmetabolism by liver enzymes, including cytochrome P450 \nisozymes. In a patient with liver dysfunction, lorazepam and \noxazepam, which are metabolized extrahepatically, are less \nlikdy to cause excessive CNS depression. Benzodiazepines are \nnot eliminated via the kidneys or lungs. Flumazenil is used to \nreverse excessive CNS depression caused by benzodiazepines. \nThe answer is B. \n10. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates {and other sedative-hypnot\u00ad\nics) are contraindicated in breathing-related sleep disorders \nbecause they further compromise ventilation. Obesity is a \nmajor cause of obstructive sleep apnea. The best prescription \nyou can give this patient is to lose weight. The answer is E. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: LOADING DOSE \n(SEE CHAPTER 3) \nBecause the half-life of diazepam is 2 days, one may assume \nthat the plasma concentration 3 h after drug ingestion is \nsimilar to the peak plasma level.

New York, NY: McGraw Hill; 2021 .) thought to occur at ethanol blood levds between 60 and 80 mg/ \nd.L. Blood levels of 120 to 160 mg/d.L are usually associated with \ngross drunkenness. Levds greater than 300 mg/dL may lead to \nloss of consciousness, anesthesia, and coma sometimes with fatal \nrespiratory and cardiovascular depression. Blood levds higher than \n500 mg/d.L are usually lethal. Individuals with alcohol dependence \nwho are tolerant to the effects of ethanol can function almost nor\u00ad\nmally at much higher blood concentrations than occasional drink\u00ad\ners, although the acutely lethal concentration is not elevated as \nmuch. Additive CNS depression occurs with concomitant inges\u00ad\ntion of ethanol and a wide variety of CNS depressants, including \nsedative-hypnotics, opioid agonists, and many drugs that block \nmuscarinic and H1 histamine receptors. The molecular mecha\u00ad\nnisms underlying the complex CNS effects of ethanol are not \nfully understood. Specific receptors for ethanol have not been \nidentified. Rather, ethanol appears to modulate the function of a \nnumber of signaling molecules. It facilitates the action of GABA \nat GABAA receptors, inhibits the ability of glutamate to activate \nNMDA (N-methyl-o-aspartate) receptors, and modifies the activi\u00ad\nties of adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channds. \n2. Other organ systems-Ethanol, even at relatively low blood \nconcentrations, significantly depresses the heart. Vascular smooth \nmuscle is relaxed, which leads to vasodilation, which in cold envi\u00ad\nronments causes marked hypothermia. \nC. Chronic Effects \n1. Tolerance and dependence-Tolerance occurs mainly as a \nresult of CNS adaptation and, to a lesser extent, by an increased \nrate of ethanol metabolism. There is cross-tolerance to sedative-\u00ad\nhypnotic drugs that facilitate GABA activity (eg, benzodiazepines \nand barbiturates). Both psychological and physical dependence are \nmarked and constitute akoho/-.use disorder or al.coho/ism. \n2. Uver-Liver disease is the most common medical complication \nof chronic alcohol abuse.

Excessive CNS depression-Acute ethanol intoxication is \nmanaged by maintenance of vital signs and prevention of aspira\u00ad\ntion associated with vomiting. Intravenous dextrose is standard. \nThiamine administration is used to protect against W ernicke\u00ad\nKorsakoff syndrome, and correction of electrolyte imbalance may \nbe required. \n2.

Peripheral effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and \narrhythmias. The withdrawal syndrome is managed by correc\u00ad\ntion of dectrolyte imbalance and administration of thiamine and \na sedative-hypnotic. A long-acting benzodiazepine (cg, diazepam, \nchlordiazepoxide) is usually used unless the patient has compro\u00ad\nmised liver function, in which case a short-acting benzodiazepine \nwith less complex metabolism (eg, lorazepam) is preferred. \n3. Treatment of alcohol-use disorder-Alcoholism is a com\u00ad\nplex sociomedical problem, characterized by a high rdapse rate. \nSeveral CNS neurotransmitter systems appear to be targets for drugs \nthat reduce the craving for alcohol. The opioid receptor antagonist \nnaltremne has proved to be useful in some patients, presumably \nthrough its ability to decrease the effects of endogenous opioid pep\u00ad\ntides in the brain (see Chapters 31 and 32). A long-acting depot \npreparation of naltrexone is approved for onre-monthly admin\u00ad\nistration. Several antidepressants have been reported to reduce \nalcohol craving in small studies, but are not approved for this indi\u00ad\ncation. Acamprosate, an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, \nis also FDA approved for treatment of alcoholism. The aldehyde \ndehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is used adjunctivdy in some \ntreatment programs. If ethanol is consumed by a patient who has \ntaken disulflram, acetaldehyde accumulation leads to nausea, head\u00ad\nache, flushing, and hypotension (Figure 23--1). \nOTHER ALCOHOLS \nA.Methanol \nMethanol {wood alcohol), a constituent of windshidd cleaners \nand \"canned heat,\" is sometimes ingested intentionally. Intoxica\u00ad\ntion causes visual dysfunction, gastrointestinal distress, shortness \nof breath, loss of consciousness, and coma. Methanol is metabo\u00ad\nlized to formaldehyde and formic acid, which causes severe acido\u00ad\nsis, retinal damage, and blindness. The formation of formaldehyde \nis reduced by prompt intravenous administration of fomepimle, \nan inhibitor of ADH, or ethanol, which competitively inhibits \nADH oxidation of methanol (Figure 23-2). \nB.

This man's regular rate of alcohol consumption is not high \nenough to put him at risk of long-term consequences such \nas Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, increased susceptibility to \nbacterial pneumonia, or alcohol withdrawal seizures. This \npattern of \"binge drinking\" does put him at increased risk of \ncardiac arrhythmia. The answer is B. \n2. This patient has symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy, \nincluding delirium, gait disturbances, and paralysis of the \nexternal eye muscles. The condition results from thiamine \ndeficiency but is rarely seen in the absence of alcoholism. The \ndiazepam is administered to prevent the alcohol withdrawal \nsyndrome. Glucosamine is primarily used for pain associated \nwith arthritis. The answer is E. \n3. The microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) con\u00ad\ntributes most to ethanol metabolism at relatively high blood \nalcohol concentrations (>100 mg/dL), when the alcohol \ndehydrogenase pathway is saturated due to depletion of \nNAD+. So, the MEOS system contributes most when the \nNAD+ concentration is low. NADPH and oxygen are cofac\u00ad\ntors for MEOS reactions. The concenuation of acetaldehyde \ndoes not appear to affect the rate of either the ADH or the \nMEOS reactions. The answer is C. \n4. The blood level of ethanol achieved in this individual is \nextremely high, probably associated with coma, and likely to \nresult in death due to respiratory arrest in a person who lacks \ntolerance to ethanol. The answer is C. 5. Behavioral disinhibition is a feature of early intoxication from \nethanol and most other alcohols but not the solvent, hexane. \nOcular dysfunction, including horizontal nystagmus and dip\u00ad\nlopia, is also a common finding in poisoning with alcohols, \nbut the complaint of \"flickering white spots before the eyes\" \nor \"being in a snowstorm\" is highly suggestive of methanol \nintoxication. In some cases, the odor of formaldehyde may be \npresent on the breath. In this patient, blood methanol levels \nshould be determined as soon as possible. The answer is E. \n6. In patients with suspected methanol intoxication, fomepizole \nis given intravenously to inhibit the ADH-catalyzed forma\u00ad\ntion of toxic metabolites. The answer is C. \n7. Chronic use of ethanol induces CYP2El, an isozyme that \nconverts acetaminophen to a cytotoxic metabolite . This \nappears to be the cause of the increased susceptibility to acet\u00ad\naminophen-induced hepatotoxicity found in individuals who \nregularly ingest alcohol. The answer is D. \n8. This woman's infant is at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome, a \nsyndrome associated with mental retardation, abnormalities \nof the head and face, and growth deficiency. This syndrome is \na leading cause of mental retardation. The answer is D. \n9. The nausea, hypotension, and ill feeling that result from \ndrinking ethanol while also taking disulfiram stems from \nacetaldehyde accumulation. Disulflram inhibits acetaldehyde \ndehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts acetaldehyde to \nacetate. The answer is A. \n10. Naltrexone, a competitive inhibitor of opioid receptors, \ndecreases the craving for alcohol in patients who are recover\u00ad\ning from alcoholism. The answer is D. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: ELIMINATION \nHALF-LIFE (SEE CHAPTER 1) \nDrug information resources do not provide data on the elimi\u00ad\nnation half-life of ethanol because, in the case of this drug, \nit is not constant. Ethanol elimination follows zero-ord\u2022r \nkinetics because the drug is metabolized at a constant rate \nirrespective of its concentration in the blood (see Chapter 3). \nThe pharmacokinetic relationship between ellmlnatlon half\u00ad\nlife, volume of distribution, and clearance, given by \n0.693xVd t112\"' ___ _ \nCL \nis not applicable to ethanol. Its rate of metabolism is con\u00ad\nstant, but its clearance decreases with an increase in blood \nlevel. The linear arithmetic plot of ethanol blood level versus \ntime follows a straight line (not exponential decay). Zero\u00ad\norder kinetics is also characteristic of aspirin and phenytoin in \nhigh concentrations. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The metabolism of phenytoin is enhanced in the pres\u00ad\nence ofinducers ofliver metabolism (eg, phenobarbital, rifampin) \nand inhibited by other drugs (eg, cimetidine, isoniazid). Phenyt\u00ad\noin itself induces hepatic drug metabolism, decreasing the effects \nof other antiseizure drugs including carbamazepine, clonazepam, \nand lamotrigine. Fruiphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug form of \nphenytoin that is used parenterally. \nB. carbamazepine \nCarbamazepine induces formation of liver drug-metabolizing \nenzymes that increase metabolism of the drug itself and may \nincrease the clearance of many other antiseizure drugs including \nclonazepam, lamotrigine, and valproate. Carbamazepine metabo\u00ad\nlism can be inhibited by other drugs (eg, propoxyphene, valpro\u00ad\nate). A related drug, oxca.rbuepine, is less likely to be involved in \ndrug interactions. \nC. Valproate \nIn addition to competing for phenytoin plasma protein binding \nsites, valproate inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine, etho\u00ad\nsuximide, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and lamotrigine. Hepatic \nbiotransformation of valproate leads to formation of a toxic \nmetabolite that has been implicated in the hepatotoxicicy of the \ndrug. The active form of the drug is the valproate ion, regardless of \nwhether valproic acid or sodium valproate are administered . \nD. Other Drugs \nGabapentin, pregabalin, levetiracetam, and vigabatrin are unusual \nin that they are eliminated by the kidney, largely in unchanged form. \nThese agents have vinually no drug-drug interactions. Tiagabine, \ntopiramate, and zonisamide undergo both hepatic metabolism and \nrenal elimination of intact drug. Perampanel has a long half-life and \nis metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 and subsequent glucuronida\u00ad\ntion. Lamotrigine is eliminated via hepatic glucuronidation; retiga\u00ad\nbine is eliminated by both glucuronidation and acetylation. MECHANISMS OF ACTION \nThe general effect of antiseizure drugs is to suppress repetitive \naction potentials in epileptic foci in the brain. Many different \nmechanisms are involved in achieving this effect. Sodium channel \nblockade is one. Figure 24-1 illustrates two other major strategies: \nenhancement of inhibitory GABA synapses (panel A) and inhi\u00ad\nbition of excitatory glutamate activity (panel B). In some cases, \nseveral mechanisms may contribute to the antiseizure activity of an \nindividual drug. Some of the recognized mechanisms are described \nnext. \nA. Sodium Channel Blockade \nAt therapeutic a:mcentrations, phenytoin, carbamuepine, lamotrig-\u00ad\nine, lamsamide, and zonisami.de block voltage-gated sodium chan\u00ad\nnels in neuronal membranes. Topiramate may also act, in part, by \nthis mechanism. This action is rate-dependent (ie, block increases with \nincreased frequency of neuronal discharge) and results in prolongation \nof the inactivated state of the Na+ channel and the refractory period \nof the neuron. Phenobarbital and valprom may exert similar effects \nat high doses. \nB. GABA-Related Targets \nAs described in Chapter 22, benwdiazcpines interact with specific \nreceptors on the GABAA receptor-chloride ion channel macromo\u00ad\nlecular complex. In the presence of benzodiazepines, the frequency \nof chloride ion channel openings is increased; these drugs facilitate \nthe inhibitory effects of GABA Phenobarbital and other barbi\u00ad\nturates also enhance the inhibitory actions of GABA but interact \nwith a different receptor site that results in an increased duration \nof chloride ion channel openings. \nGABA aminotransaminase (GABA-T) is an important enzyme \nin the termination of action of GABA. This enzyme is irrevers\u00ad\nibly inactivated by vigabattin at therapeutic plasma levels and \ncan also be inhibited by valproate at very high concentrations. \nTiagabine inhibits a GABA transporter (GAT-1) in neurons and \nglia, prolonging the action of the neurotransmitter.

            "Text": "208 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nCLINICAL USES \nDiagnosis of a specific seizure type is important for prescribing \nthe most appropriate antiseizure drug (or combination of drugs). \nDrug choice is usually made on the basis of established efficacy in \nthe specific seizure state that has been diagnosed, the prior respon\u00ad\nsiveness of the patient, the anticipated toxicity of the drug, and \npossible drug interactions. Treatment may involve combinations \nof drugs, following the principle of adding known effective agents \nif the preceding drugs are not sufficient. \nA. Generalized Tonlc-Clonlc Seizures \nLamotrigine, valproate, and topirarnate are the drugs of choice for \ngeneralized tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal) seizures. Phenobar\u00ad\nbital (or primidone) is now considered to be an alternative agent in \nadults but continues to be a primary drug in infants. Carbamaze\u00ad\npine, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and lacosamide are also approved \ndrugs for this indication, and several others may be used as an \nalternative treatment or adjunctively in refractory cases. \nB. Focal Seizures \nThe drugs of first choice are carbamazepine (or oxcarbazepine), \nlamotrigine, phenytoin, or levetiracetam. Alternatives include topi\u00ad\nramate, valproate, fdbamate, and phenobarbital. Many of the newer \nantiseizure drugs can be used adjunctively, including gabapentin \nand prcgabalin, a structural congener, and zonisamide. Because of \nits retinal toxicity, retigabine is used only when other agents are not \neffective. \nC. Generalized Absence Seizures \nEthosuximide or valproate are the preferred drugs because they \ncause minimal sedation. Ethosuximide is often used in uncom\u00ad\nplicated absence seizures if patients can tolerate its gastrointesti\u00ad\nnal side effects. V alproate is particularly useful in patients who \nhave concomitant generalized tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures. \nLamotrigine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide are also effective in \nabsence seizures. Clonazepam is effective as an alternative drug but \nhas the disadvantages of causing sedation and tolerance. \nD. Myoclonic and Atypical Absence Syndromes \nMyoclonic seizure syndromes are usually treated with valpro\u00ad\nate; lamotrigine is approved for adjunctive use, but is commonly \nused as monotherapy. Clonazepam can be effective, but the high \ndoses required cause drowsiness . Levetiracetam, topiramate, and \nzonisamide are also used as backup drugs in myoclonic syndromes. \nFelhamate has been used adjunctivdy with the primary drugs hut \nhas both hematotoxic and hepatotoxic potential. \nE. Status Eplleptlcus \nIntravenous diazepam or lorazepam is usually effective in terminat\u00ad\ning attacks and providing short-term control. For prolonged ther\u00ad\napy, intravenous phenytoin has often been used because it is highly \neffective and less sedating than benzodiazepines or barbiturates. \nHowever, phenytoin may cause cardiotoxicity (perhaps because of \nits solvent, propylene glycol), and fosphenytoin (water-soluble) is a safer parenteral agent. Phenobarbital has also been used in status \nepilepticus, especially in children. In very severe status epilepticus \nthat does not respond to these measures, general anesthesia may \nbe used. \nF. Other Cllnlcal Uses \nSeveral antiseizure drugs are effective in the management of bipo\u00ad\nlar affective disorders, especially valproate, which is now often \nused as a first-line drug in the treatment of mania. Carbamaze\u00ad\npine and lamotrigine have also been used successfully in bipolar \ndisorder. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice for trigeminal neu\u00ad\nralgia, and its congener oxcarbazepine may provide similar anal\u00ad\ngesia with fewer adverse effects. Gabapentin has efficacy in pain \nof neuropathic origin, including postherpetic neuralgia, and, like \nphenytoin, may have some value in migraine. T opiramate is also \nused in the treatment of migraine. Prcgabalin is also approved for \nneuropathic pain. \nTOXICITY \nChronic therapy with antiseizure drugs is associated with specific \ntoxic effects, the most important of which are listed in Table 24-1. \nA. Teratogenicity \nChildren born of mothers taking several antiseizure drugs have an \nincreased risk of congenital malformations. Neural tube defects \n(eg, spina bifida) are associated with the use of valproate; carba\u00ad\nmazepine has been implicated as a cause of craniofacial anoma\u00ad\nlies and spina bifida; and a fetal hydantoin syndrome has been \ndescribed after phenytoin use by pregnant women. \nB. Overdosage Toxicity \nMost of the commonly used antiseizure drugs are CNS depres\u00ad\nsants, and respiratory depression may occur with overdosage. \nManagement is primarily supportive (airway management, \nmechanical ventilation), and flumazenil may be used in benzodi\u00ad\nazepine overdose. \nC. Life-Threatening Toxicity \nFatal hepatotoxicity has occurred with valproate, with greatest \nrisk to children younger than 2 years and patients taking multiple \nantiseizure drugs. Lamotrigine has caused skin rashes and life\u00ad\nthreatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrol\u00ad\nysis. Children are at higher risk (1-2% incidence), especially if \nthey are also taking valproate. Zonisamide may also cause severe \nskin reactions. Reports of aplastic anemia and acute hepatic failure \nhave limited the use of felbamate to severe, refractory seizure states. \nD. Withdrawal \nWithdrawal from antiseizure drugs should be accomplished gradu\u00ad\nally to avoid increased seizure frequency and severity. In general, \nwithdrawal from antiabsence drugs is more easily accomplished \nthan withdrawal from drugs used in focal or generalized tonic\u00ad\nclonic seizure states. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Of the following drugs, which is most suitable \nfor long-term management of this patient? \n(A) Clonazepam \n(B) Ethosuximide \n(C) Felbamate \n(D) Phenytoin \n(E) Pregabalin ANSWERS \n1. This child suffers from absence seizures, and 2 of the drugs \nlisted are effective in this seizure disorder. Clonazepam is \neffective but exerts troublesome CNS-depressant effects, \nand tolerance develops with chronic use. Ethosuximide is \nnot excessively sedating, and tolerance does not develop to \nits antiseizure activity. Valproate (not listed) is also used in \nabsence seizures. The answer is C. \n2. Benzodiazepines facilitate GABA-mediated inhibitory actions. \nEthosuximide selectively blocks calcium channels in thalamic \nneurons. Phenobarbital produces multiple effects, mainly \nenhancement of GABA-chloride inhibitory activity. Zonisamide \nblocks voltage-gated Na\u2022 channels. Phenytoin selectively blocks \nthe Na\u2022 channel and prolongs the inactivated state. The answer \nis D. \n3. Read the question carefully. Several of these agents (car\u00ad\nbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) induce drug\u00ad\nmetabolizing enzymes and reduce the plasma concentration \nof other drugs. Valproate, an inhibitor of drug metabolism, \ncan increase the plasma levels of many drugs, including those \nused in seizure disorders such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, \nphenobarbital, and phenytoin. Benzodiazepines (including \nclonazepam and diazepam) as well as gabapentin and vigaba\u00ad\ntrin have no major effects on the metabolism of other drugs. \nThe answer is E. \n4. Ethosuximide and valproate are preferred drugs in absence \nseizures because they cause minimal sedation. However, etho\u00ad\nsuximide causes gastrointestinal distress and valproate causes \nweight gain and is potentially hepatotoxic. In addition, val\u00ad\nproate use in pregnancy has been associated with teratoge\u00ad\nnicity (neural tube defects). Peripheral neuropathy, including \ndiminished deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, \noccurs with the chronic use of phenytoin, not valproate. \nThe answer is C. \nS. The enzyme-inducing activity of phenytoin and carbamaze\u00ad\npine has led to symptoms of opioid withdrawa4 presumably \nbecause of an increase in the rate of metabolism of opioids. \nMonitoring of plasma concentration of phenytoin may be \ncritical in establishing an effective dosage because of nonlinear \nzero-order elimination kinetics at high doses. Valproate has \nno effect on porphyrin synthesis. Vigabatrin does not affect \nthe metabolism of oral contraceptives. Gabapentin has a rela\u00ad\ntively short half-life (5-8 h) and is given twice or three times \ndaily. Twice-daily dosage of ethosuximide reduces the severity \nof adverse gastrointestinal effects. The answer is B. \n6. Common adverse effects of phenytoin include nyscagmus, \ndiplopia, and ataxia. With chronic use, abnormalities of \nvitamin D metabolism, coarsening of facial features, gingival \novergrowth, and hirsutism may also occur. A major adverse \neffect of carbamazepine, tiagabine, and wnisamide is CNS \ndepression. The answer is C. \n7. Dose tapering is an important principle in antiseizure drug \nwithdrawal. As a rule, withdrawal from drugs used for absence \nseizures such as ethosuximide is easier than withdrawal from \ndrugs used for focal and tonic-clonic seizures. Withdrawal is \nmost difficult in patients who have been treated with barbitu\u00ad\nrates and benzodiazepines. The answer is C. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Automated EEG monitoring, an automated tech\u00ad\nnique based on quantification of anesthetic effects, is also useful. \nMECHANISMS OF ACTION \nThe mechanisms of action of general anesthetics are varied. As \nCNS depressants, these drugs usually increase the threshold for fir\u00ad\ning of CNS neurons. The potency of inhaled anesthetics is roughly \nproportional to their lipid solubility. Mechanisms of action \ninclude effects on ion channds by interactions with membrane lip\u00ad\nids or proteins with subsequent effects on central neurotransmitter \nmechanisms. Inhaled anesthetics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, \netomidate, and propofol facilitate y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\u00ad\nmediated inhibition at GABAA receptors. These receptors are \nsensitive to clinically rdevant concentrations of the anesthetic \nagents and exhibit the appropriate stereospeciflc effects in the case \nof enantiomeric drugs. Ketamine possibly acts via antagonism of \nthe action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid on the \nN-methyl-n-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Most inhaled anesthet\u00ad\nics also inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor isoforms at \nmoderate to high concentrations. The strychnine-sensitive glycine \nreceptor is another ligand-gated ion channel that may be a target \nfor certain inhaled anesthetics. CNS neurons in different regions \nof the brain have different sensitivities to general anesthetics; inhi\u00ad\nbition of neurons involved in pain pathways occurs before inhibi\u00ad\ntion of neurons in the midbrain reticular formation. \nINHALED ANESTHETICS \nA. Classification and Pharmacokinetics \nThe agents currently used in inhalation anesthesia are nitrous \noxide (a gas) and several easily vaporized liquid halogenated hydro\u00ad\ncarbons, including halotbanc, dcdluranc, cnfturanc, isofturanc, \nand scvofluranc. They are administered as gases; their partial pres\u00ad\nsure, or \"tension,\" in the inhaled air or in blood or other tissue is \na measure of their concentration. Because the standard pressure of \nthe total inhaled mixture is atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg at \nsea level), the partial pressure may also be expressed as a percent\u00ad\nage. Thus, 50% nitrous oxide in the inhaled air mixture would \nhave a partial pressure of 380 mm Hg. The speed of induction of \nanesthetic effects depends on several factors, discussed next. 1. Solubility- The more rapidly a drug equilibrates with the \nblood, the more quickly the drug passes into the brain to produce \nanesthetic effects. Drugs with a low blood:gas partition wcffi.cient \n(eg, nitrous oxide) equilibrate more rapidly than those with a higher \nblood solubility (eg, halothane), as illustrated in Figure 25-1. \nPartition coefficients for inhalation anesthetics are shown in \nTable 25-1. \n2. Inspired gas partial pressure-A high partial pressure of \nthe gas in the lungs results in more rapid achievement of anesthetic \nlevds in the blood. This effect can be put to use by the initial \nadministration of gas concentrations higher than those required \nfor maintenance of anesthesia. \n3. Ventilation rate-The greater the ventilation, the more rapid \nis the rise in alveolar and blood partial pressure of the agent and \nthe onset of anesthesia (Figure 25-2). This effect is exploited in \nthe induction of the anesthetic state. \n4. Pulmonary blood flow-At high pulmonary blood flows, \nthe gas's partial pressure rises at a slower rate; thus, the speed of \nonset of anesthesia is reduced. At low flow rates, onset is faster. \nIn circulatory shock, this effect may accelerate the rate of onset of \nanesthesia with agents of high blood solubility. \n5. Arferiovenous concentration gradient-Uptake of soluble \nanesthetics into highly perfused tissues may decrease gas tension \nin mixed venous blood. This can influence the rate of onset of \nanesthesia because achievement of equilibrium is dependent on the \ndifference in anesthetic tension between arterial and venous blood. \nB. Ellmlnatlon \nInhaled anesthesia is terminated by redistribution of the drug from \nthe brain to the blood, from the blood to the alveolar air, and elim\u00ad\nination of the drug through the lungs. The rate of recovery from \nanesthesia using agents with low blood:gas partition coefficients \nis faster than that of anesthetics with high blood solubility. This \nirnponant property has led to the introduction of several newer \ninhaled anesthetics (eg, desflurane, sevoflurane), which, because \nof their low blood solubility, are characterized by recovery times \nthat are considerably shoner than is the case with older agents. \nHalothane is metabolized by liver enzymes to a significant extent"

In this schematic \ndiagram, solubility is represented by the size of the blood compartment (the more soluble the gas, the larger is the compartment). For a given \nconcentration or partial pressure of the 2 anesthetic gases in the ins pi red air, it will take much longer with halothane than with nitrous oxide for \nthe blood partial pressure to rise to the same partial pressure as in the alveoli. Because the concentration in the brain can rise no faster than the \nconcentration in the blood, the onset of anesthesia will be much slower with halothane than with nitrous oxide.

Metabolism of halothane has only a minor influ\u00ad\nence on the speed of recovery from the anesthetic effect but does \nplay a role in potential toxicity. \nC. Minimum Alveolar Anesthetic Concentration \nThe potency of inhaled anesthetics is best measured by the mini\u00ad\nmum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC), defined as the \nalveolar concentration required to eliminate the response to a stan\u00ad\ndardized painful stimulus in 50% of patients. Each anesthetic has a \ndefined MAC (Table25-l), but this value mayvaryamongpatients \ndepending on age, cardiovascular status, and use of adjuvant drugs. \nEstimations of MAC value suggest a relatively steep dose-response \nrelationship for inhaled anesthetics.

            "Text": "Although nitrous oxide has low anesthetic potency (ie, a high \nMAC), it exerts marked analgesic and amnestic actions. \n2. Cardiovascular effects-Most inhaled anesthetics decrease \narterial blood pressure moderately. Enflurane and halothane are \nmyocardial depressants that decrease cardiac output, whereas iso\u00ad\nflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane cause peripheral vasodilation. \nNitrous oxide is less likely to lower blood pressure than are other \ninhaled anesthetics. Blood flow to the liver and kidney is decreased \nby most inhaled agents. Inhaled anesthetics depress myocardial \nfunction-nitrous oxide least. Halothane, and to a lesser degree \nisoflurane, may sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic \neffects of catecholamines. \n3. Respiratory effects-Although the rate of respiration may be \nincreased, all inhaled anesthetics cause a dose-dependent decrease in \ntidal volume and minute ventilation, leading to an increase in arte\u00ad\nrial C02 tension. Inhaled anesthetics decrease ventilatory response to \nhypoxia even at subanesthetic concentrations (eg, during recovery). \nNitrous oxide has the smallest effect on respiration. Most inhaled \nanesthetics are bronchodilators, but desflurane is a pulmonary irri\u00ad\ntant and may cause bronchospasm. The pungency of enflurane \ncauses breath-holding, which limits its use in anesthesia induction. \n4. Toxicity-Postoperative hepatitis has occurred (rarely) after \nhalothane anesthesia in patients experiencing hypovolemic shock \nor other severe stress. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is unclear \nbut may involve formation of reactive metabolites that cause direct \ntoxicity or initiate immune-mediated responses. Fluoride, possibly \nreleased by the metabolism of enflurane and sevoflurane, may \ncause renal insufficiency after prolonged anesthesia. Prolonged \nexposure to nitrous oxide decreases methionine synthase activity \nand may lead to megaloblastic anemia. Susceptible patients may \ndevelop malignant hyperthermia {see Table 16-2) when anes\u00ad\nthetics are used together with neuromuscular blockers (especially \nsuccinylcholine). A premonitory sign of malignant hyperthermia \nis trismus {masseter hypertonia) . This rare condition is thought in \nsome cases to be due to mutations in the gene loci corresponding \nto the ryanodine receptor (RyRl). Other chromosomal loci for \nmalignant hyperthermia include mutant alleles of the gene encod\u00ad\ning skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels. The uncontrolled \nrelease of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle \nleads to muscle spasm, hyperthermia, and autonomic lability. \nDantrolene is indicated for the treatment of this life-threatening \ncondition, with supportive management. \nSKILL KEEPER: SIGNALING MECHANISMS \n(SEE CHAPTER 2) \nLike most drugs, general anesthetics appear to act via \ninteractions with specific receptor molecules involved in cell \nsignaling. For review purposes, list the major types of trans\u00ad\nmembrane signaling mechanisms relevant to the actions \nof drugs that act via receptors. The Ski I I Keeper Answers \nappear at the end of the chapter. CHAPTER 25 General Anesthetics 217 \nINTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS \nA.Propofol \nPropofol produces anesthesia as rapidly as the intravenous barbitu\u00ad\nrates, and recovery is more rapid. Propofol has antiemetic actions, \nand recovery is not delayed after prolonged infusion. The drug is \nvery commonly used as a component of balanced anesthesia and \nas an anesthetic in outpatient surgery. Propofol is also effective \nin producing prolonged sedation in patients in intensive care set\u00ad\ntings. Propofol may cause marked hypotension during induction \nof anesthesia, primarily through decreased peripheral resistance. \nTotal body clearance of propofol is greater than hepatic blood \nflow, suggesting that its elimination includes other mechanisms \nin addition to metabolism by liver enzymes. Fospropofol, a water\u00ad\nsoluble prodrug form, is broken down in the body by alkaline \nphosphatase to form propofol. However, onset and recovery are \nboth slower than propofol. Although fospropofol appears to cause \nless pain at injection sites than the standard form of the drug, \nmany patients experience paresthesias. \nB. Barbiturates \nTbiopental and mcthobaital have high lipid solubility, which \npromotes rapid entry into the brain and results in surgical anes\u00ad\nthesia in one circulation time (<1 min). These drugs are used for \ninduction of anesthesia and for short surgical procedures. The \nanesthetic effects of thiopental are terminated by redistribution \nfrom the brain to other highly perfused tissues (Figure 25-3), but \nhepatic metabolism is required for elimination from the body. \nBarbiturates are respiratory and circulatory depressants; because \nthey depress cerebral blood flow, they can also decrease intracra\u00ad\nnial pressure. \nC. Benzodiazepines \nMidazolam is widely used adjunctively with inhaled anesthetics \nand intravenous opioids. The onset of its CNS effects is slower \nthan that of thiopental, and it has a longer duration of action. \nCases of severe postoperative respiratory depression have occurred. \nThe benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, accelerates \nrecovery from midazolam and other benzodiazepines. \nD.Ketamlne \nThis drug produces a state of \"dissociative anesthesia\" in which \nthe patient remains conscious but has marked catatonia, analgesia, \nand amnesia. Ketamine is a chemical congener of the psychoto\u00ad\nmimetic agent, phencyclidine (PCP), and inhibits NMDA gluta\u00ad\nmate transmission. The drug is a cardiovascular stimulant, and this \naction may lead to an increase in intracranial pressure. Emergence \nreactions, including disorientation, excitation, and hallucinations, \nwhich occur during recovery from ketamine anesthesia, can be \nreduced by the preoperative use of benzodiazepines. \nE.Oplolds \nMorphine and fentanyl are used with other CNS depressants \n(nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines) in anesthesia regimens and are \nespecially valuable in high-risk patients who might not survive a"

CHAPTER 25 General Anesthetics 219 \nThe new agent described here resembles nitrous oxide but is \nmore potent, as indicated by its low MAC value. Not all halo\u00ad\ngenated anesthetics undergo significant hepatic metabolism or \nrelease fluoride ions. The answer is D. \n2. Propofol has an antiemetic effect. Halothane and other \ninhaled anesthetics have been used in the management of \nstatus asthmaticus; they do not cause bronchoconstriction. \nEnflurane, not isoflurane, is associated with muscle twitching. \nOpioids such as fentanyl may cause truncal rigidity. Thiopen\u00ad\ntal has a rapid redistribution and recovery from anesthesia is \nnot prolonged. The answer is B. \n3. lsoflurane sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamines, \nas does halothane (not listed). Arrhythmias may occur in \npatients with cardiac disease who have high circulating levels \nof epinephrine and norcpinephrine (cg, patients with pheo\u00ad\nchromocytoma). Other newer inhaled anesthetics are consid\u00ad\nerably less arrhythmogenic. The answer is C. \n4. Anemia has not been reported in patients exposed to nitrous \noxide anesthesia for periods as long as 6 h. Nitrous oxide is the \nleast potent of the inhaled anesthetics, and the compound has \nnot been implicated in malignant hyperthermia. More than \n98% of the gas is eliminated via the lungs. The answer is A \n5. MAC value is inversely related to potency; a low MAC means \nhigh potency. MAC gives no information about the slope of \nthe dose-response curve. Use of opioid analgesics or other \nCNS depressants with inhaled anesthetics lowers the MAC \nvalue. As with most CNS depressants, the elderly patient is \nmore sensitive, so MAC values are lower. Halothane has the \nlowest MAC value of the inhaled anesthetics described in this \nchapter. The answer is D. \n6. Intravenous opioids (eg, fentanyl) are widely used in anes\u00ad\nthesia for cardiac surgery because they provide full analge\u00ad\nsia and cause less cardiac depression than inhaled anesthetic \nagents. The opioids are not cardiac stimulants, and fentanyl \nis more likdy to cause skdetal muscle rigidity than rdaxation. \nDisadvantages of this technique are patient recall (which can \nbe decreased by concomitant use of a benzodiazepine) and \nthe occurrence of hypertensive responses to surgical stimu\u00ad\nlation. The addition of vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside) or a \n~blocker ( eg, esmolol} may be needed to prevent intraoperative \nhypertension. Opioid effects arc readily reversed by naloxonc. \nThe answer is A \n7. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but life..threatening reaction \nthat may occur during general anesthesia with halogenated \nanesthetics and skeletal muscle relaxants, particularly succi\u00ad\nnylcholine and tubocurarine. Release of calcium from skeletal \nsarcoplasmic reticulum leads to muscle spasms, hyperther\u00ad\nmia, and autonomic instability. Predisposing genetic fac\u00ad\ntors include clinical myopathy associated with mutations in \nthe gene loci for the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor or \nL-type calcium receptors . Nitrous oxide is not metabolized! \nThe answer is D. \n8. The drug of choice in malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, \nwhich reduces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic \nreticulum of skeletal muscle cells. Appropriate measures must \nbe taken to lower body temperature, control hypertension, \nand restore acid-base and electrolyte balance. The answer is C."

Subgroups within the local anesthetics are based on this \nchemical characteristic and on duration of action. The commonly \nused local anesthetics are weak bases with at least one ioni7.ablc amine \nfunction that can become charged through the gain of a proton (H'). \nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the degree of ioni7.ation is a function of the \npK. of the drug and the pH of the medium. Because the pK. of most \nlocal anesthetics is between 8.0 and 9.0 (benzocaine is an ex.ception), \nvariations in pH associated with infection (infected tissues can be as \nlow as 6.4) can have significant cffi:cts on the proportion ofionizcd to \nnonionizcd drug. The question of the active fonn of the drug (ionized \nversus nonion.iu:d) is discussed later. \nPHARMACOKINETICS \nMany shoner-acting local anesthetics are readily absorbed into the \nblood from the injection site after administration. The duration \nof local action is therefore limited unless blood flow to the area is \n222 Long action \n(buplvacaine, \nroplvacalne) Amides \nI \nMedium action \n(lldocalne) \nreduced. This can be accomplished by administration of a vaso\u00ad\nconstrictor (usually an a-agonist sympathomimctic) with the local \nanesthetic agent. Cocaine is an important exception because it has \nintrinsic sympathomimctic action due to its inhibition of norepi\u00ad\nncphrine reuptake into nerve terminals. The longer-acting agents \n(eg, bupivacaine, ropivacainc, tctracainc) arc also less depen\u00ad\ndent on the coadministration of vasoconstrictors. Surface activ\u00ad\nity (ability to reach superficial nerves when applied to the surface \nof mucous membranes} is a property of certain local anesthetics, \nespecially cocaine and benzocaine (both only available as topical \nforms}, lidocaine, and tctracaine. \nMetabolism of ester local anesthetics is carried out by plasma \ncholinesterases (pseudocholinesterascs} and is very rapid fur procaine \n(half-life, 1-2 min}, slower fur cocaine, and very slow fur tetracaine. \nThe amides are metaboli7.ed in the liver, in part by cytochrome P450 \nisozymes. The half-lives of lidoc:aine and prilocaine are approxi\u00ad\nmately 1.5 h. Bupivacainc and ropivacainc arc the longest-acting \namide local anesthetics with half-lives of 3.5 and 4.2 h, respec\u00ad\ntively.

Sodium ions are not able to pass through the channel when the drug is bound to the receptor. \nThe local anesthetic diffuses within the membrane in its uncharged form. In the aqueous extracellular and intracellular spaces, the charged form \n(Drugi is also present. \nAcidification of the urine promotes ionization of local anes\u00ad\nthetics; the charged forms of such drugs are more rapidly excreted \nthan nonionized forms. \nMECHANISM OF ACTION \nLocal anesthetics block voltage-dependent sodium channels and \nreduce the influx of sodium ions, thereby preventing depolar\u00ad\nization of the membrane and blocking conduction of the action \npotential. Local anesthetics gain access to their receptors from the \ncytoplasm or the membrane (Figure 26-1). Because the drug mol\u00ad\necule must cross the lipid membrane to reach the cytoplasm, the \nmore lipid-soluble (nonionized, uncharged) form reaches effec\u00ad\ntive intracellular concentrations more rapidly than does the ion\u00ad\nized form. On the other hand, once inside the axon, the ionized \n(charged) form of the drug is the more effective blocking entity. \nThus, both the nonionized and the ionized forms of the drug play \nimportant roles---the first in reaching the receptor site and the second in causing the effect. The affinity of the receptor site within \nthe sodium channel for the local anesthetic is a function of the \nstate of the channel, whether it is resting, open, or inactivated, and \ntherefore follows the same rules of use dependence and voltage \ndependence that were described for the sodium channel-blocking \nantiarrhythmic drugs (see Chapter 14).

            "Text": "224 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nfibers arc blocked more easily than unmyelinatcd fibers. Activated \npain fibers fire rapidly; thus, pain sensation appears to be sdec\u00ad\ntively blocked by local anesthetics. Fibers located in the periphery \nof a thick nerve bundle are blocked sooner than those in the core \nbecause they are exposed earlier to higher concentrations of the \nanesthetic. \nB. Other Tissues \nThe effects of these drugs on the heart are discussed in Chapter 14 \n(see group 1 antiarrhythmic agents}. Most local anesthetics also \nhave weak blocking effects on skeletal muscle neuromuscular \ntransmission, but these actions have no clinical application. The \nmood elevation induced by cocaine reflects actions on dopamine \nor other amine-mediated synaptic transmission in the CNS rather \nthan a local anesthetic action on membranes. \nCLINICAL USE \nThe local anesthetics are commonly used for minor surgical pro\u00ad\ncedures, often in combination with vasoconstrictors such as epi\u00ad\nnephrine. Onset of action may be accelerated by the addition of \nsodium bicarbonate, which enhances intracellular access of these \nweakly basic compounds. Articaine has the fastest onset of action. \nLocal anesthetics are also used in spinal anesthesia and to produce \nautonomic blockade in ischemic conditions. Slow epidural infu\u00ad\nsion at low concentrations has been used successfully for postop\u00ad\nerative analgesia (in the same way as epidural opioid infusion; see \nChapter 31). Repeated epidural injection in anesthetic doses may \nlead to tachyphylaxis. Intravenous local anesthetics may be used \nfor reducing pain in the perioperative period. Oral and parenteral \nforms oflocal anesthetics are sometimes used adjunctively in neu\u00ad\nropathic pain states. \nTOXICITY \nA. CNS Effects \nThe important toxic effects of most local anesthetics are in the \nCNS. All local anesthetics are capable of producing a spectrum of \ncentral effects, including light-headedness or sedation, restlessness, \nnystagmus, and tonic-clonic convulsions. Severe convulsions may \nbe followed by coma with respiratory and cardiovascular depres\u00ad\nsion. Rarely, intrathecal local anesthetics may cause neuronal \ninjury. \nB. Cardiovascular Effects \nWith the exception of cocaine, all local anesthetics are vasodila\u00ad\ntors. Patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease may develop \nheart block and other disturbances of cardiac electrical function at \nhigh plasma levels oflocal anesthetics. Bupivacaine, a racemic mix\u00ad\nture of two isomers, may produce severe cardiovascular toxicity, \nincluding arrhythmias and hypotension. The (S) isomer, levobu\u00ad\npivacaine, is less cardiotoxic. Cardiotoxicity has also been rcponed \nfor ropivacaine when used for peripheral nerve block. The abil\u00ad\nity of cocaine to block norepinephrine reuptake at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions and the drug's vasoconstricting actions \ncontribute to cardiovascular toxicity. When cocaine is used as a \ndrug of abuse, its cardiovascular toxicity includes severe hypenen\u00ad\nsion with cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocar\u00ad\ndial infarction. \nC. Other Toxic Effects \nPrilocaine is metabolized to products that include o-toluidine, an \nagent capable of converting hemoglobin to methemoglobin. \nThough tolerated in healthy persons, even moderate methemoglo\u00ad\nbinemia can cause decompensation in patients with cardiac or pul\u00ad\nmonary disease. The ester-type local anesthetics are metabolized to \nproducts that can cause antibody formation in some patients. \nAllergic responses to local anesthetics are rare and can usually be \nprevented by using an agent from the amide subclass. In high con\u00ad\ncentrations, local anesthetics may cause a local neurotoxic action \n(especially important in the spinal cord) that includes histologic \ndamage and permanent impairment of function. \nSKILL KEEPER: CARDIAC TOXICITY OF \nLOCAL ANESTHETICS (SEE CHAPTER 14) \nExplain how hyperkalemia facilitates the cardiac toxicity of \nlocal anesthetics. The Skill Keeper Answer appears at the \nend of the chapter. \nD. Treatment of Toxicity \nSevere toxicity is treated symptomatically; there are no antidotes. \nConvulsions are usually managed with intravenous diazepam or a \nshort-acting barbiturate such as thiopental. Hyperventilation with \noxygen is helpful. Occasionally, a neuromuscular blocking drug \nmay be used to control violent convulsive activity. The cardio\u00ad\nvascular toxicity of bupivacaine overdose is difficult to treat and \nhas caused fatalities in young adults; intravenous administration \noflipid (\"lipid resuscitation\") has been reponed to be ofbeneflt. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

Local anesthetics bind preferentially to sodium channels in \nthe open and inactivated states. Recovery from drug-induced \nblock is I 0-1000 times slower than recovery of channels from \nnormal inactivation. Resting channels have a lower affinity \nfor local anesthetics. The answer is D. \n2. Because the drug is a weak base, it is more ionized (proton\u00ad\nated) at pH values lower than its pK,,. Because the pH given is \n1 log unit lower (more acid) than the pK,,, the ratio of ionized \nto nonionized drug will be approximately 90: I 0. The answer \nis B. (Recall from Chapter I that at a pH equal to pK,,, the \nratio is 1: 1; at 1 log unit difference, the ratio is approximately \n90: 1 O; at 2 log units difference, 99: 1; and so on.) \n3. Myelinated nerve fibers are blocked by local anesthetics more \nreadily than unmyelinated ones. See the Skill Keeper answer \nfor an explanation of the effects ofhypocalcemia and hyperka\u00ad\nlemia on nerve blockade by local anesthetics. The answer is B. \n4. Of the effects listed, the most important in local anesthetic \noverdose (of both amide and ester types) concern the CNS. \nSuch effects can include sedation or restlessness, nystagmus, \ncoma, respiratory depression, and seizures. Intravenous diaz\u00ad\nepam is commonly used for seizures caused by local anesthet\u00ad\nics. Methemoglobinemia is caused by a prilocaine metabolite. \nThe answer is D. \nS. Local anesthetics are poor substrates for acetylcholinester\u00ad\nase, and the activity of this enzyme does not play a part in \nterminating the actions of local anesthetics. Ester-type local \nanesthetics are hydrolyzed by plasma (and tissue) pseudocho\u00ad\nlinesterases. Persons with genetically based defects in pseudo\u00ad\ncholinesterase activity are unusually sensitive to procaine and \nother esters. The answer is A. \n6. The fact that you have 10 mL of the solution of lidocaine is \nirrelevant. A 2% solution of any drug contains 2 g/100 mL. \nThe amount of lidocaine in I mL of a 2% solution is thus \n0.02 g, or 20 mg. The answer is D. \n7. Acidosis resulting from tissue hypoxia favors local anesthetic \ntoxicity because these drugs bind more avidly (or dissociate \nmore slowly) from the sodium channel binding site when \nthey are in the charged state. (Note that onset of therapeutic \neffect may be slower because charged local anesthetics pen\u00ad\netrate the membrane less rapidly; see text.) Hyperkalemia \ndepolarizes the membrane, which also favors local anesthetic \nbinding. Oxygenation reduces both acidosis and hyperkale\u00ad\nmia. Bupivacaine may cause severe cardiotoxicity including \narrhythmias. Rapid administration of a lipid emulsion may \nimprove recovery from bupivacaine and levobupivacaine. \nThe answer is B."

Mechanism of action-Nondepolariz.ing drugs prevent the \naction of ACh at the skeletal muscle end plate (Figure 27-1). They \nact as surmountable blockers. (Thus, the blockade can be over\u00ad\ncome by increasing the amount of agonist [ACh] in the synaptic \ncleft.) They behave as though they compete with ACh at the recep\u00ad\ntor, and their effect is reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors. Some \ndrugs in this group may also act directly to plug the ion channel \noperated by the nicotinic ACh receptor. Post-tetanic potentiation \nis preserved in the presence of these agents, but tension during the \ntetanus fades rapidly. See Table 27-1 for additional details. Larger \nmuscles (eg, abdominal, diaphragm) are more resistant to neuro\u00ad\nmuscular blockade, but they recover more rapidly than smaller \nmuscles (eg, facial, hand). Of the available nondepolarizing drugs, \nrocuronium has the most rapid onset time (60-120 s) and is used \nfor endotracheal intubation. \nC. Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs \nf. Pharmacokinetics-Succinylcholine is composed of two \nACh molecules linked end to end. Succinylcholine is metabolized \nby a cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase or pseudocholinester\u00ad\nase) in the liver and plasma but is largely resistant to acetylcho\u00ad\nlinesterase. It has a duration of action of only a few minutes if \ngiven as a single dose. Blockade may be prolonged in patients with \ngenetic variants of plasma cholinesterase that metabolize succinyl\u00ad\ncholine very slowly. Such variant cholinesterases are resistant to \nthe inhibitory action of dibucaine, which can be used to detect \nthe mutant form. Succinylcholine is not rapidly hydrolyzed by \nacetylcholinesterase. \n2. Mechanism of action-Succinylcholine is a nicotinic agonist \nand depolarizes the neuromuscular end plate (Figure 27-1). \nThe initial depolarization is often accompanied by twitching \nand fasciculations (prevented by pretreatment with small doses of \na nondepolarizing blocker). Because tension cannot be maintained \nin skeletal muscle without periodic repolarization and depolari7.a \u00ad\ntion of the end plate, continuous depolarization results in muscle \nrelaxation and paralysis. Succinylcholine may also plug the end \nplate channels.

Bottom, right: \nA depolarizing blocker, eg, succinylcholine (blue), both occupying \nthe receptor and blocking the channel. Normal closure of the channel \ngate is prevented and the blocker may move rapidly in and out of the \npore.

An additional \neffect of drugs on the end plate channel may occur through changes \nin the lipid environment surrounding the channel (not shown). Gen\u00ad\neral anesthetics and alcohols may impair neuromuscular transmission \nby this mechanism. (Reproduced with permission from Katzung BG, \nVanderah TW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15th ed.

Reversal of Blockade \nSugammada is a chemical antagonist of rocuronium and also has \nactivity against vecuronium. The sugammadex-NM blocker chda\u00ad\ntion product is then excreted in the urine. Sugammadex is usually \nwell tolerated. However, sugarnmadex may rarely cause anaphy\u00ad\nlaxis, marked bradycardia, and coagulopathy. \nThe action of all nondepolarizing blockers is readily reversed by \nincreasing the concentration of normal transmitter at the receptors. \nThis is best accomplished by administration of cholinesterase inhibi\u00ad\ntors such as neostigmine or pyridostigmine. In contrast, the paralysis \nproduced by the depolarizing blocker succinylcholine is increased by \ncholinesterase inhibitors during phase I. During phase II, the block \nproduced by succinylcholine is usually reversible by cholinesterase \ninhibitors. \nE. Toxicity \nf. Respiratory paralysis-The action of full doses of neu\u00ad\nromuscular blockers leads directly to respiratory paralysis. If \nmechanical ventilation is not provided, the patient will asphyxiate. \n2. Autonomic effects and histamine release-Autonomic \nganglia are stimulated by succinylcholine and weakly blocked by \ntubocurarine. Succinylcholine activates cardiac muscarinic recep\u00ad\ntors, whereas pancuronium is a moderate blocking agent and \ncauses tachycardia. Tubocurarine and mivacurium (withdrawn in \nthe USA) are the most likely of these agents to cause histamine \nrelease, but it may also occur to a slight extent with atracurium and \nsuccinylcholine. Vecuronium and several newer nondepolarizing drugs (cisatracurium, doxacurium, pipecuronium, rocuronium) \nhave no significant effects on autonomic functions or histamine \nrelease. A summary of the autonomic effects of neuromuscular \ndrugs is set forth in Table 27-2. \n3. Specific effects of succinylcholine-Muscle pain is a com\u00ad\nmon postoperative complaint, and muscle damage may occur. \nSuccinylcholine may cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients \nwith burns or spinal cord injury, peripheral nerve dysfunction, or \nmuscular dystrophy. Increases in intragastric pressure caused by \nfasciculations may promote regurgitation with possible aspiration \nof gastric contents. \n4. Drug interactions-Inhaled anesthetics, especially isoflu\u00ad\nrane, strongly potentiate and prolong neuromuscular blockade. \nA rare interaction of succinylcholine with inhaled anesthetics can \nresult in malignant hyperthermia (see Table 16-2). An early sign \nof this potentially life-threatening condition is contraction of the \njaw muscles (trismus). Aminoglycoside antibiotics and antiar\u00ad\nrhythmic drugs may potentiate and prolong the relaxant action of \nneuromuscular blockers to a lesser degree. Because sugarnmadex \nbinds the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium \nand vecuronium, it can also block other steroidal drugs. The two \nmost important of these are progesterone-based contraceptives and \nthe selective estrogen receptor modulator toremifene. Therefore, \nbackup contraception methods are recommended for 7 days after \nsugarnmadex exposure. \n5. Effects of aging and diseases-Older patients (>75 years) \nand those with myasthenia gravis are more sensitive to the actions \nof the nondepolarizing blockers, and doses should be reduced in \nthese patients. Conversely, patients with severe burns or who suf\u00ad\nfer from upper motor neuron disease are less responsive to these \nagents, probably as a result of proliferation of extrajunctional nico\u00ad\ntinic receptors.

Bladder control and anal sphincter control are \nalso affected in most cases and may require autonomic drugs for \nmanagement. In other circumstances, acute injury or inflamma\u00ad\ntion of muscle leads to spasm and pain. Such temporary spasm can \nsometimes be reduced with appropriate drug therapy. \nThe goal of spasmolytic therapy in both chronic and acute \nconditions is reduction of excessive skeletal muscle tone without \nreduction of strength. Reduced spasm results in reduction of pain \nand improved mobility. \nA. Drugs for Chronic Spasm \n1. Classification- The spasmolytic drugs, in contrast to the \nNM blockers, do not resemble ACh in structure or effect. They \nact in the CNS and in one case in the skeletal muscle cell rather \nthan at the neuromuscular end plate. The spasmolytic drugs used \nin treatment of the chronic conditions mentioned previously \ninclude diaupam, a benzodiazepine (see Chapter 22); badofen, \na y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist; thanidine, a congener of \nclonidine; and dantrolene, an agent that acts on the sarcoplasmic \nreticulum of skeletal muscle. These agents are usually administered by the oral route. Refractory cases may respond to chronic intra\u00ad\nthecal administration of baclofen. Botulinum toxin injected into \nselected muscles can reduce pain caused by severe spasm (see \nChapter 6) and also has application for ophthalmic purposes and \nin more generalized spastic disorders (eg, cerebral palsy). Gabar \npentin and pregabalin, antiseizure drugs, have been shown to be \neffective spasmolytics in patients with multiple sclerosis. \n2. Mechanisms of action-The spasmolytic drugs act by several \nmechanisms. Three of the drugs (baclofen, diazepam, and tizani\u00ad\ndine) act in the spinal cord (Figure 27-2). \nBaclofen acts as a GABA 8 agonist (see Chapter 22) at both \npresynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, causing membrane hyper\u00ad\npolarization. Presynaptically, baclofen decreases the rdease of the \nexcitatory transmitter glutamic acid by increasing K\u2022 effiux and \nreducing calcium influx. At postsynaptic receptors, baclofen facili\u00ad\ntates the inhibitory action of GABA. Diazepam facilitates GABA\u00ad\nmediated inhibition via its interaction with GABAA receptors (see \nChapter 22). Tizanidine, an imidazoline related to clonidine with \nsignificant <Xi agonist activity, reinforces presynaptic inhibition in \nthe spinal cord. All three drugs reduce the tonic output of the pri\u00ad\nmary spinal motoneurons. Idrocilamide and riluzole are newer \ndrugs for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that \nappear to have spasm-reducing effects, possibly through inhibition \nof glutamatergic transmission in the CNS. \nDantrolene acts in the skeletal muscle cell to reduce the release \nof activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via interac\u00ad\ntion with the ryanodine receptor (RyRl) channel. Cardiac muscle \nand smooth muscle are minimally depressed. Dantrolene is also \neffective in the treatment of malignant hypertbermia, a disor\u00ad\nder characterized by massive calcium rdease from the sarcoplasmic \nreticulum of skdetal muscle. Though rare, malignant hyperther\u00ad\nmia can be triggered by general anesthesia protocols that include \nsuccinylcholine or tubocurarine (see Chapter 25). In this emer\u00ad\ngency condition, dantrolene is given intravenously to block cal\u00ad\ncium release (see Table 16-2). \n3. Toxicity- The sedation produced by diazepam is significant \nbut milder than that produced by other sedative-hypnotic drugs \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

MPTP (l-methyl-4-\nphenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a byproduct of the attempted \nsynthesis of an illicit meperidine analog, causes irreversible par\u00ad\nkinsonism through destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the \nnigrostriatal tract.

Mechanisms-Because dopamine has low bioavailability \nand does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, its precursor, \nL-dopa (levodopa), is used. This amino acid enters the brain via \nan L-amino acid transporter (LA n and is converted to dopamine \nby the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (dopa decar\u00ad\nboxylase), which is present in many body tissues, including the \nbrain. Levodopa is usually given with carbiclopa, a drug that does \nnot cross the blood-brain barrier but inhibits dopa decarboxylase \nin peripheral tissues (Figure 28-2). With this combination, the \nplasma half-life is prolonged, lower doses oflevodopa are effective, \nand there are fewer peripheral side effects.

However, the drug does not cure parkinsonism, \nand responsiveness fluctuates and gradually decreases with time, \nwhich may reflect progression of the disease. Clinical response fluc\u00ad\ntuations may, in some cases, be rdated to the timing of levodopa \ndosing. In other cases, unrelated to dosing, off-periods of akine\u00ad\nsia may alternate over a few hours with on-periods of improved \nmobility but often with dyskinesias (on-off phenomena). In some \ncases, off-periods may respond to apomorphine or to a newer \nagent, istradefylline. lstradefylline is an analog of caffeine and a \nsdective antagonist of the adenosine A2A. receptor. \nAlthough drug holidays sometimes reduce toxic effects, they \nrardy affect response fluctuations and are no longer recom\u00ad\nmended. In contrast, catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT) \ninhibitors are often used adjunctively to reduce fluctuations in \nlevodopa responses in some patients (see below). \n3. Toxicity-Most adverse effects are dose dependent. Gastro\u00ad\nintestinal effects include anorexia, nausea, and emesis and can \nbe reduced by taking the drug in divided doses. Tolerance to the \nemetic action of levodopa usually occurs after several months. Postural hypotension is common, especially in the early stage of \ntreatment. Other cardiac effects include tachycardia, asystole, and \ncardiac arrhythmias (rare). \nDyskinesias occur in up to 80% of patients, with choreoath\u00ad\netosis of the face and distal extremities occurring most often. \nSome patients may exhibit chorea, ballismus, myoclonus, tics, and \ntremor. \nBehavioral effects may include anxiety, agitation, confusion, \ndelusions, hallucinations, and depression. Lcvodopa is contraindi\u00ad\ncated in patients with a history of psychosis. \nB. Dopamine Agonlsts \n1. Pramlpexole-This non-ergot drug has high agonist affin\u00ad\nity for the dopamine D3 receptor. It is effective as monotherapy \nin mild parkinsonism and can be used together with levodopa \nin more advanced disease. Pramipexole is administered orally 3 \ntimes daily and is excreted largdy unchanged in the urine. The \ndose of pramipexole may require reduction in patients with renal \ndysfunction. Adverse effects include anorexia, nausea and vomit\u00ad\ning, postural hypotension, and dyskinesias. Mental disturbances \n(confusion, delusions, hallucinations, compulsive disorders, eg, \ngambling) are toxicities and are more common with pramipexole \n(and ropinirole) than with levodopa. In rare cases, an uncontrolla\u00ad\nble tendency to fall asleep may occur. The drug is contraindicated \nin patients with active peptic ulcer disease, psychotic illness, or \nrecent myocardial infuction. Pramipexole may be neuroprotective \nbecause it is reponed to act as a scavenger for hydrogen peroxide. \n2. Ropinirole-Another non-ergot, this drug has high agonist \naffinity for the dopamine D2 receptor. It is effective as monother\u00ad\napy and can also be used with levodopa to smooth out response \nfluctuations. The standard form is given 3 times daily, but a pro\u00ad\nlonged release form can be taken once daily. Ropinirole is metabo\u00ad\nlized by hepatic CYP1A2, and other drugs metabolized by this \nisoform (cg, caffeine, warfarin) may reduce its clearance. Adverse \neffects and contraindications are similar to those of pramipex:ole. \n3. Apomorphine-A potent dopamine receptor agonist, apo\u00ad\nmorphine injected subcutaneously may provide rapid (within \n10 min) but temporary relief (1-2 h) of off-periods of akinesia \nin patients on optimized dopaminergic therapy. Because of severe \nnausea, pretreatment for 3 days with antiemetics (eg, trimethoben\u00ad\nzamide) is necessary. Other side effects of apomorphine include \ndyskinesias, hypotension, drowsiness, and sweating. \n4. Rotigotine-Rotigotine is a newer dopamine agonist that is \nadministered via a transdermal patch. It is proposed that it pro\u00ad\nvides a slower and more continuous action than the oral dopamine \nagonists. \n5. Bromocriptine-An ergot alkaloid, bromocriptine acts as a \npartial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. The drug \nincreases the functional activity of dopamine neurotransmitter \npathways, including those involved in extrapyramidal functions \n(Figure 28-2). Pergolide is similar."

            "Text": "238 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nBromocriptine has been used as monotherapy, in combinations \nwith levodopa (and with anticholinergic drugs), and in patients \nwho are refractory to or cannot tolerate levodopa. Common \nadverse effects include anorexia, nausea and vomiting, dyskine\u00ad\nsias, and postural hypotension. Behavioral effects, which occur \nmore commonly with bromocriptine than with newer dopa\u00ad\nmine agonists, include confusion, hallucinations, and delusions. \nErgot-related effects include erythromelalgia and pulmonary infil\u00ad\ntrates. Bromocriptine is now considered obsolete in patients with \nParkinson disease. \nC. Monoamlne Oxldase Inhibitors \n1. Mechanism-Selegiline and ruagiline are selective inhibi\u00ad\ntors of monoamine oxidase type B, the form of the enzyme that \nmetabolizes dopamine (Figure 28-2). Hepatic metabolism of \nselegiline results in the formation of desmethylselegiline (possi\u00ad\nbly neuroprotective) and amphetamine. Safinamide is a similar \nMAO-B-selective inhibitor that has been recently approved. \n2. Clinical use-Selegiline has minimal efficacy in parkinson\u00ad\nism if given alone but can be used adjunctively with levodopa. \nRasagiline is more potent and has been used as monotherapy in \nearly symptomatic parkinsonism as well as in combinations with \nlevodopa. Safinamide appears to have no efficacy in monotherapy. \n3. Toxicity and drug Interactions-Adverse effects and inter\u00ad\nactions of monoamine oxidase inhibitors include insomnia, mood \nchanges, dyskinesias, gastrointestinal distress, and hypotension. \nCombinations of these drugs with meperidine have resulted in agi\u00ad\ntation, delirium, and mortality. Sdegiline has been implicated in \nthe serotonin syndrome when used with serotonin selective reup\u00ad\ntake inhibitors (SSRis; see Chapter 16). \nD. Catechol-0-methyltransferase Inhibitors \n1. Mechanism of action-Entacapone and tolcapone are \ninhibitors ofCOMT, the enzyme in both the CNS and peripheral \ntissues (Figure 28-2) that converts levodopa to 3-0-methyldopa \n(3-0MD). Increased plasma levels of 3-0MD are associated with \npoor response to levodopa partly because the compound competes \nwith levodopa fur active transport into the CNS. Entacapone acts \nonly in the periphery. Opicapone is a similar COMT inhibitor \nthat has recently been approved in Europe and the USA. \n2. Clinical uses-The drugs are used as adjuncts to levodopa\u00ad\ncarbidopa, decreasing fluctuations, improving response, and pro\u00ad\nlonging on-time. Tolcapone is taken 3 times daily, entacapone \n5 times daily. A formulation combining levodopa, carbidopa, and \nentacapone is available, simplifying the drug regimen. \n3. Toxicity-Adverse effects related partly to increased levels of \nlevodopa include dyskinesias, gastrointestinal distress, and pos\u00ad\ntural hypotension. Levodopa dose reductions may be needed \nfur the first few days of COMT inhibitor use. Other side effects \ninclude sleep disturbances and orange discoloration of the urine. Tolcapone increases liver enzymes and has caused acute hepatic \nfailure, necessitating routine monitoring ofliver function tests and \nsigned patient consent fur use in the United States. \nE. Amantadlne \n1. Mechanism of actlon-Amantadine enhances dopaminer\u00ad\ngic neurotransmission by unknown mechanisms that may involve \nincreasing synthesis or release of dopamine or inhibition of dopa\u00ad\nmine reuptake. The drug also has muscarinic blocking actions. \n2. Phannacologic effects-Amantadine may improve brady\u00ad\n.kinesia, rigidity, and tremor but is usually effective fur only a few \nweeks. Amantadine also has antiviral effects. \n3. Toxicity-Behavioral effects include restlessness, agitauon, \ninsomnia, confusion, hallucinations, and acute toxic psychosis. \nDermatologic reactions include livedo reticularis. Miscellaneous \neffects may include gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary reten\u00ad\ntion, and postural hypotension. Amantadine also causes peripheral \nedema, which responds to diuretics. \nF. Acetylchollne-Blocklng (Antlmuscarlnlc) Drugs \n1. Mechanism of action-These drugs (eg, benztropine, biper\u00ad\niden, orphenadrine) decrease the excitatory actions of cholinergic \nneurons on cells in the striatum by blocking muscarinic receptors. \n2. Clinical effects-- These drugs may improve the tremor and \nrigidity of par.kinsonism but have little effect on bradykinesia. \nThey are used adjunctivdy in parkinsonism and also alleviate \nthe reversible extrapyramidal symptoms caused by antipsychotic \ndrugs. \n3. Toxicity-CNS toxicity includes drowsiness , inattention, con\u00ad\nfusion, delusions, and hallucinations. Peripheral adverse effects \nare typical of atropine-like drugs (see Chapter 8). These agents \nexacerbate tardive dyskinesias that result from prolonged use of \nantipsychotic drugs. \nG. Other Drugs \nOther drugs may be needed to treat the behavioral signs of \nadvanced par.kinsonism.

Physiologic and Essential Tremor \nPhysiologic and essential tremor are clinically similar conditions \ncharacterized by postural tremor. The conditions may be accentu\u00ad\nated by anxiety, fatigue, and certain drugs, including bronchodila\u00ad\ntors, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium. They may be alleviated \nby ~-blocking drugs including propranolol. Beta blockers should \nbe used with caution in patients with heart failure, asthma, dia\u00ad\nbetes, or hypoglycemia. Metoprolol, a ~1-selective antagonist, is \nalso effective, and its use is preferred in patients with concomi\u00ad\ntant pulmonary disease. Antiepileptic drugs including gabapentin, \nlevetiracetam, primidone, topiramate, certain benzodiazepines \n(eg, alprazolam}, and intramuscular injection ofbotulinum toxin, \nhave also been used to treat essential tremor. \nB. Huntington Disease and Tourette Syndrome \nHuntington disease, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of \nthe huntingtin gene, results from a brain neurotransmitter imbal\u00ad\nance such that GABA functions are diminished and dopaminer\u00ad\ngic functions are enhanced (Figure 28-1). There may also be a \ncholinergic deficit because choline acetyltransferase is decreased \nin the basal ganglia of patients with this disease. However, phar\u00ad\nmacologic attempts to enhance brain GABA and acetylcholine \nactivities have not been successful in patients with this disease. \nDrug therapy usually involves the use of amine-depleting drugs \n(eg, tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine}, which inhibit the vesic\u00ad\nular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Dopamine receptor \nantagonists (eg, haloperidol, perphenazine) are sometimes useful \nand olanzapine is also used (see Chapter 29). \nT ourette syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause that fre\u00ad\nquently responds to haloperidol and other dopamine D2 receptor \nblockers, including pimozide. Though less effective, carbamaze\u00ad\npine, clonazepam, and clonidine have also been used. \nC. Drug-Induced Dyskinesias \nParkinsonism symptoms caused by antipsychotic agents (see \nChapter 29) are usually reversible by lowering drug dosage, chang\u00ad\ning the therapy to a drug that is less toxic to extrapyramidal func\u00ad\ntion, or treating with a muscarinic blocker. In acute dystonias, \nparenteral administration of benztropine or diphenhydramine is \nhelpful. Levodopa and bromocriptine are not useful because dopa\u00ad\nmine receptors are blocked by the antipsychotic drugs. Tardive \ndyskinesias that develop from therapy with older antipsychotic \ndrugs are possibly a form of denervation supersensitivity. They are \nnot readily reversed; but deutetrabenazine and valbenazine show \npromise and are in accelerated clinical trials. \nD. Wilson Disease \nThis recessively inherited disorder of copper metabolism results in \ndeposition of copper salts in the liver and other tissues. Hepatic \nand neurologic damage may be severe or fatal. Treatment involves \nuse of the chelating agent penicillamine (dimethylcysteine}, which \nremoves excess copper. Toxic effects of penicillarnine include gastrointestinal distress, myasthenia, optic neuropathy, and blood \ndyscrasias. Trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have also been used. \nE. Restless Legs Syndrome \nThis syndtome, of unknown cause, is characterized by an unpleas\u00ad\nant creeping discomfort in the limbs that occurs particularly when \nthe patient is at rest. The disorder is more common in pregnant \nwomen and in uremic and diabetic patients. Dopaminergic therapy \nis the preferred treatment, and both pramipaole and ropinirole \nare approved for this condition. Opioid analgesics, benzodiaz\u00ad\nepines, and certain anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin) are also used. \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1 and 2. Bradykinesia has made drug treatment neces\u00ad\nsary in a 60-year-old man with Parkinson disease, and therapy is \nto be initiated with levodopa. \nI. Regarding the anticipated actions oflevodopa, the least likely \ntoxicity is \n(A) Dizziness, especially when standing \n(B) Nausea (he should take the drug in divided doses) \n(C) Llvedo reticularis \n(D) Slow chorciform movements \n(E) Sudden uncontrollable muscle jerks \n2. The prescribing physician will (or should) know that levodopa \n(A) Should be given in increased dosage if given together \nwith a dtug that inhibits hepatic dopa decarboxylase \n(B) Fluctuates in its effectiveness with increasing frequency \nas treatment continues \n(C) Prevents extrapyramidal adverse effects of antipsychotic \ndrugs \n(D) Protects against cancer in patients with melanoma \n(E) Has toxic effects, which include pulmonary infiltrates \n3. Which statement about pramipexole is most accurate? \n(A) Effectiveness in Parkinson disease requires its metabolic \nconversion to an active metabolite \n(B) It should not be administered to patients taking anti\u00ad\nmuscarinic drugs \n(C) Pramipexole causes fewer mental disturbances than \nlevodopa \n(D) The drug selectivdy activates the dopamine D3 receptor \nsubtype \n(E) W arfarin may enhance the actions of pramipexole \n4. A patient with parkinsonism is being treated with levodopa. \nHe suffers from irregular, involuntary muscle jerks that affect \nthe proximal muscles of the limbs. Which of the following \nstatements about these symptoms is most accurate? \n(A) Coadministration of muscarinic blockers prevents \nthe occurrence of dyskinesias during treatment with \nlevodopa \n(B) Drugs that activate dopamine receptors can exacerbate \ndyskinesias in a patient taking levodopa \n(C) Dyskinesias are less likely to occur if levodopa is admin\u00ad\nistered with carbidopa \n(D) Symptoms are likely to be alleviated by continued treat\u00ad\nment with levodopa \n(E) The symptoms are usually reduced if the dose oflevodopa \nis increased"

A \ndrug used to \"rescue\" the patient that provides temporary \nrelief is \n(A) Apomorphine \n(B) Benz.tropine \n(C) Carbidopa \n(D) Pramipexole \n(E) Selegiline \n6. Concerning the drugs used in parkinsonism, which statement \nis most accurate? \n(A) Dopamine receptor agonists should never be used in \nParkinson disease before a trial of levodopa \n(B) Levodopa causes mydriasis and may precipitate an acute \nattack of glaucoma \n(C) Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of COMT \n(D) The primary benefit of antimuscarinic drugs in parkin\u00ad\nsonism is their ability to relieve bradykinesia \n(E) Therapeutic effects of amantadine continue for several \nyears \n7. A previously healthy 40-ycar-old woman begins to suffer \nfrom slowed mentation, lack of coordination, and brief writh\u00ad\ning movements of her hands that are not rhythmic. In addi\u00ad\ntion, she has delusions of being persecuted. The woman has \nno history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders but several \nrelatives have had similar symptoms. Although further diag\u00ad\nnostic assessment should be made, it is very likely that the \nmost appropriate drug for treatment will be \n(A) Amantadine \n(B) Bromocriptine \n(C) Diaz.epam \n(D) Haloperidol \n(E) Levodopa \n8. With respect to pramipexole, which of the following is most \naccurate? \n(A) Activates brain dopamine D3 receptors \n(B) Effective as monotherapy in mild parkinsonism \n(C) May cause postural hypotension \n(D) Not an ergot derivative \n(E) All of the above \n9. Tolcapone may be of value in patients being treated with \nlevodopa-carbidopa because it \n(A) Activates COMT \n(B) Decreases the formation of 3-0-methyldopa \n(C) Inhibits monoamine oxidase type A \n(D) Inhibits neuronal reuptake of dopamine \n(E) Releases dopamine from nerve endings \n10. Which of the following drugs is most suitable for manage\u00ad\nment of essential tremor in a patient who has pulmonary \ndisease? \n(A) Diaz.epam \n(B) Levodopa \n(C) Metoprolol \n(D) Propranolol \n(E) Terbutaline ANSWERS \n1. In prescribing levodopa, the patient should be informed \nabout adverse effects, including gastrointestinal distress, pos\u00ad\ntural hypotension, and dyskinesias. It is reasonable to advise \nthe patient that therapeutic benefits cannot be expected to \ncontinue indefinitely. Livedo reticularis (a netlike rash) is an \nadverse effect of treatment with amantadine. The answer is C. \n2. Levodopa causes less peripheral toxicity but more CNS or \nbehavioral side effects when its conversion to dopamine is \ninhibited outside the CNS. The drug is not effective in antag\u00ad\nonizing the akinesia, rigidity, and tremor caused by treatment \nwith antipsychotic agents. Levodopa is a precursor of melanin \nand may activate malignant melanoma. Use oflevodopa is not \nassociated with pulmonary dysfunction. The answer is B. \n3. Pramipexole is a dopamine D3 receptor activator and docs not \nrequire bioactivation. It is excreted in unchanged form. Con\u00ad\nfusion, delusions, and hallucinations occur more frequently \nwith dopamine receptor activators than with levodopa. (Rop\u00ad\ninirole is similar but has greater affinity for the D2 receptor.) \nThe use of dopaminergic agents in combination with anti\u00ad\nmuscarinic drugs is common in the treatment of parkinson\u00ad\nism. Warfarin may enhance the action of ropinirole, another \ndopamine receptor agonist. The answer is D. \n4, The form and severity of dyskincsias resulting from levodopa \nmay vary widely in individual patients. Dyskinesias occur in \nup to 80% of patients receiving levodopa for long periods. \nWith continued treatment, dyskinesias may develop at a \ndose of levodopa that was previously well tolerated. Musca\u00ad\nrinic receptor blockers do not prevent their occurrence. They \noccur more commonly in patients treated with levodopa in \ncombination with carbidopa or with other dopamine receptor \nagonises. The answer is B. \n5. Apomorphine, via subcutaneous injection, is used for tempo\u00ad\nrary relief of off-periods of akinesia (rescue) in parkinsonian \npatients on dopaminergic drug therapy. Pretreatment with \nthe antiemetic trimethobenzamide for 3 days is essential to \nprevent severe nausea. The answer is A. \n6. The non-ergot dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) \nare sometimes used prior to levodopa in mild parkinsonism. \nThe mydriatic action of levodopa may increase intraocular \npressure; the drug should be used cautiously in patients with \nopen-angle glaucoma and is contraindicated in those with \nangle-closure glaucoma. Antimuscarinic drugs may improve \nthe tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism but have little \neffect on bradykinesia. Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of \nMAO type B. Amantadine is effective for only a few weeks. \nThe answer is B. \n7. Although further diagnosis is desirable, choreoathetosis with \ndecreased mental abilities and psychosis (paranoia) suggests \nthat this patient has the symptoms of Huntington disease. \nDrugs that may be beneficial include agents that deplete \ndopamine (eg, tetrabenazine) or that block dopamine recep\u00ad\ntors (eg, haloperidol). The answer is D. \n8. Pramipexole is a non-ergot agonist at dopamine receptors and \nhas greater selectivity for D3 receptors in the striatum. Prami\u00ad\npexole (or the D2 receptor agonise ropinirolc) is often cho\u00ad\nsen for monotherapy of mild parkinsonism, and these drugs \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

This improves patient response by increas\u00ad\ning levodopa levels and by decreasing competition between \n3-0MD and levodopa for active transport into the brain by \nL-amino acid carrier mechanism.

            "Text": "244 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS \nA. Classification \nThe first-generation antipsychotic drugs constitute several chemi\u00ad\ncal subgroups including the phenothiazines (cg, chlorpromazine, \nthioridazine, fluphenazine), the thiou.nthene.s (eg, thiothixene), \nand the butyropbenooes (eg, haloperidol). \nThe established second-generation atypical antipsyc:hotic drugs \nhave varied heterocyclic structures and include clcnapine, olanzap\u00ad\nine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripipraz.ole. Some very \nrecently approved second-generation agents are listed in Table 29-1. \nIn some patients, these atypical antipsychotic drugs may be some\u00ad\nwhat more effective and are often less toxic than the older drugs. \nSeveral are now available in generic form. \nB. Pharmacokinetics \nThe antipsychotic drugs are well absorbed when given orally, and \nbecause they are lipid-soluble, they readily enter the central ner\u00ad\nvous system (CNS) and most other body tissues. Many are bound \nextensively to plasma proteins. These drugs require metabolism \nby liver enzymes before elimination and have long plasma half\u00ad\nlives that permit once-daily dosing. In some cases, other drugs \nthat inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes can prolong the half-lives \nof antipsychotic agents. Parenteral forms of some agents (eg, flu\u00ad\nphenazine, haloperidol, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) \nare available for rapid initiation of therapy, use in uncooperative \npatients, or depot treatment. \nC. Mechanism of Action \n1. Dopamine hypothesis-The dopamine hypothesis of schizo\u00ad\nphrenia proposes that the disorder is caused by a relative excess \nof functional activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine in spe\u00ad\ncific mesoconical tracts in the brain. This hypothesis is based on \nseveral observations. First, many antipsychotic drugs block brain \ndopamine receptors (especially D2 receptors). Second, dopamine \nagonise drugs (eg, amphetamine, levodopa) exacerbate schizophre\u00ad\nnia. Third, an increased density of dopamine receptors has been \ndetected in prefrontal cortical brain regions of untreated schizo\u00ad\nphrenic patients. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is \nnot fully satisfactory because antipsychotic drugs are only partly \neffective in most patients and many effective drugs have a higher \naffinity for other receptors, than for D2 receptors. Phencyclidine \n(PCP) causes a psychotic syndrome but has no effect on dopamine \nreceptors. \n2. Dopamine receptors-Five different dopamine receptors \n(D1-D5) have been characterized. Each is G protein-coupled and \ncontains 7 transmembrane domains. The D2 receptor, found in the \ncaudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, cerebral cortex, and hypo\u00ad\nthalamus, is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The therapeu\u00ad\ntic efficacy of the older antipsychotic drugs correlates with their \nrelative affinity for the D2 receptor. Unfortunately, the blockade of \nthe D2 receptors in the basal ganglia often leads to extrapyramidal \n(eg, tremor, slurred speech, akathisia, dystonia, etc) effects. 3. Other receptors-Most of the second-generation (atypi\u00ad\ncal) antipsychotic agents have higher affinities for other receptors \nthan for the D2 receptor. For example, ex adrenoceptor-blocking \naction correlates well with antipsychotic effect for many of the \ndrugs (Table 29-1). Clompioe, a drug with significant D4 and \n5-HT2 receptor-blocking actions, has virtually no affinity for D2 \nreceptors. As noted in the introduction to this chapter, many of \nthe atypical drugs (eg, olam.apioe, quetiapioe, aseoapioe, ilo\u00ad\npcridooe, lurasidonc, palipcridonc, and riapcridonc) also have \nhigh affinity for 5-HT 2A receptors, although they may also interact \nwith D2 and other receptors. Zipruidooc is an antagonist at the \nD2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HTrn receptors and an agonist at the 5-HT1A \nreceptor. The newer antipsychotic agent aripipruole is a panial \nagonist at D2 and 5-HT IA receptors but is a strong antagonist at \n5-HT 2A receptors. Aseoapioe and lurasidonc also act as panial \nagonists at the 5-HT1A receptor along with antagonist activity at \n5-HT 2A and D2 receptors. The receptor-binding characteristics \nof the newer antipsychotic drugs have led to a serotonin hypoth\u00ad\nesis as an alternative to the dopamine hypothesis of the nature of \nschizophrenia. Most of the atypical drugs cause less extrapyramidal \ndysfunction than the first-generation agents. With the exception \nof haloperidol, lurasidone, and iloperidone, all antipsychotic drugs \nblock H1 receptors to some degree. \nD. Effects \nDopamine receptor blockade is the major effect that correlates \nwith therapeutic benefit for first-generation antipsychotic drugs. \nDopaminergic tracts in the brain include the mesocortical\u00ad\nmesolimbic pathways (regulating mentation and mood), nigrostriatal \ntract (extrapyramidal function), tuberoinfundibular pathways (con\u00ad\ntrol of prolactin release), and chemoreceptor trigger zone (emesis). \nMesocortical-mesolimbic dopamine receptor blockade presumably \nunderlies antipsychotic effects, and a similar action on the chemo\u00ad\nreceptor trigger zone leads to the useful antiemetic properties of \nsome antipsychotic drugs. Adverse effects resulting from receptor \nblockade in the other dopaminergic tracts, a major problem with \nfirst-generation drugs, include extra.pyramidal dysfunction and \nhyperprolactinemia (see later discussion). Note that many antipsy\u00ad\nchotic agents block both a1 and histamine H1 receptors to some \nextent. The relative receptor-blocking actions of various antipsy\u00ad\nchotic drugs are shown in Table 29-1. \nE. Clinical Use \n1. Treatment of schizophrenio-Antipsychotic drugs reduce \nsome of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including hyper\u00ad\nactivity, bizarre ideation, hallucinations, and delusions. Con\u00ad\nsequently, they can facilitate functioning in both inpatient and \noutpatient environments. Beneficial effects may take several weeks \nto develop. Overall efficacy of the antipsychotic drugs is, for the \nmost part, equivalent in terms of the management of the floridly \npsychotic forms of the illness, although individual patients may \nrespond best to a specific drug. However, clozapine is effective \nin some schizophrenic patients resistant to treatment with other \nantipsychotic drugs. First-generation drugs are still commonly \nused, partly because of their low cost compared with newer agents. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Newer atypical \ndrugs are reported to improve some of the negative symptoms of \nschizophrenia, including emotional blunting, social withdrawal, \nand lack of motivation. \n2. Other psychiatric and neurologic indications-The \nnewer antipsychotic drugs are often used with lithium in the ini\u00ad\ntial treatment of mania. Several second-generation drugs (as well \nas benzodiazepines) are approved for treatment of acute mania; \nthree of these (aripiprazole, olanzapine, and asenapine} are also \napproved for maintenance prevention of the manic phase of bipolar \ndisorder. Several are also approved for the prevention of bipolar \ndepression (quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, cariprazine). The \nantipsychotic drugs are also used in the management of psychotic \nsymptoms of schizoaffective disorders, in Gilles de la Tourette \nsyndrome, and for management of toxic psychoses caused by over\u00ad\ndosage of certain CNS stimulants. Molindone is used mainly in \nT ourette syndrome; it is rarely used in schizophrenia. The newer \natypical antipsychotics have also been used to allay psychotic \nsymptoms in patients with Alzheimer disease and in parkinsonism. 3. Nonpsychlatrlc Indications-With the exception of thiorid\u00ad\nazine, most phenothiazines have antiemetic actions; prochlorpera\u00ad\nzine is promoted solely for this indication. H1-receptor blockade, \nmost often present in short side-chain phenothiazines, provides \nthe basis for their use as antipruritics and sedatives and contributes \nto their antiemetic effects. \nF. Toxicity \n1. Revenlble neurologlc effects-Dose-dependent extra\u00ad\npyramidal effects include a Parkinson-like syndrome with bra\u00ad\ndykinesia, rigidity, and tremor (Table 29-2). This toxicity may \nbe reversed by a decrease in dose and may be antagonized by \nconcomitant use of muscarinic blocking agents. Extrapyramidal \ntoxicity occurs most frequently with haloperidol and the more \npotent piperazine side-chain phenothiazines (eg, fluphenazine, \ntrifluoperazine). Parkinsonism occurs infrequently with clozapine \nand is much less common with the other second-generation drugs \nthan with first-generation agents. Other reversible neurologic dys\u00ad\nfunctions that occur more frequently with older agents include \nakathisia and dystonias; these usually respond to treatment with \ndiphenhydramine or muscarinic blocking agents."

It is more common with first-generation \nagents. Tardive dyskinesias tend to develop after several years of \nantipsychotic drug therapy but have appeared as early as 6 months. \nAntimuscarinic drugs that usually ameliorate other extrapyramidal \neffects generally increase the severity of tardive dyskinesia symp\u00ad\ntoms. There is no effective approved drug treatment for tardive \ndyskinesia although some investigational drugs appear promising \n(dcutettabenazine and valbenazinc, sec Chapter 28). Switching \nto clozapinc does not exacerbate the condition. Tardivc dyskincsia \nmay be attenuated temporarily by increasing neuroleptic dosage; \nthis suggests that tardive dyskinesia may be caused by dopamine \nreceptor sensitization. \n3. Autonomic effeds-Autonomic effects result from blockade \nof peripheral muscarinic receptors and ex adrenoceptors and are \nmore difficult to manage in elderly patients. Tolerance to some of \nthe autonomic effects occurs with continued therapy. Of the older \nantipsychotic agents, thioridazine has the strongest autonomic \neffects and haloperidol the weakest. Clozapine and most of the \nother atypical drugs have intermediate autonomic effects. \nAtropine-like effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary reten\u00ad\ntion, and visual problems) are often pronounced with the use of \nthioridazine and phenothiaz.ines with aliphatic side chains (eg, \nchlorpromazine). These effects also occur with clozapine and most \nof the atypical drugs but not with ziprasidone or aripiprazole. \nCNS effects from block of M receptors may include a toxic confu\u00ad\nsional state similar to that produced by atropine and the tricyclic \nantidepressants. \nPostural hypotension caused by a blockade is a common mani\u00ad\nfestation of many of the older drugs, especially phenothiazines. \nIn the elderly, measures must be taken to avoid f.tlls resulting \nfrom postural fainting. The atypical drugs, especially clozapine \nand ziprasidone, also block a receptors and can cause orthostatic \nhypotension. Failure to ejaculate is common in men treated with \nthe phenothiazines. \n4. Endocrine and metabolic effects-Endocrine and meta\u00ad\nbolic effects include hyperprolactinemia, gynecomastia, the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, and infertility. Most of these \nadverse effects are predictable manifestations of dopamine D2 \nreceptor blockade in the pituitary; dopamine is the normal inhibi\u00ad\ntory regulator of prolactin secretion. Elevated prolactin is promi\u00ad\nnent with risperidone. Significant weight gain and hyperglycemia \ndue to a diabetogenic action occur with several of the second\u00ad\ngeneration agents, especially clozapine and olanzapine. These \neffects may be especially problematic in pregnancy. Aripiprazole \nhas little or no tendency to cause hyperglycemia, hyperprolac\u00ad\ntinemia, or weight gain. \n5. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome-Patients who are par\u00ad\nticularly sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic \ndrugs may develop a malignant hyperthcrmic syndrome. The \nsymptoms include muscle rigidity, impairment of sweating, hyper\u00ad\npyrexia, and autonomic instability, which may be life threatening. \nDrug treatment involves the prompt use of dantrolene, diazepam, \nand dopamine agonists (see also Table 16-2). \n6. Sedation-This is more marked with phenothiazines (espe\u00ad\ncially chlorpromazine) than with other antipsychotics; this effect \nis usually perceived as unpleasant by nonpsychotic persons. Flu\u00ad\nphenazine and haloperidol arc the least sedating of the older drugs; \naripiprazole and lurasidone appear to be the least sedating of the \nsecond-generation agents. \n7. Miscellaneous toxicities-Visual impairment caused by \nretinal deposits has occurred with thioridazinc; at high doses, \nthis drug may also cause severe conduction defects in the heart \nresulting in fatal ventricular arrhythmias.

            "Text": "seizures, which are usually managed with diazepam or phenytoin. \nThioridazine (and possibly ziprasidone) overdose, because of car\u00ad\ndiotoxicity, is more difficult to treat. \nLITHIUM & OTHER DRUGS USED \nIN BIPOLAR (MANIC-DEPRESSIVE) \nDISORDER \nLithium is effective in treatment of the manic phase of bipolar \ndisorder and continues to be used for acute-phase illness and for \nprevention of recurrent manic and depressive episodes. \nA. Pharmacokinetics \nLithium is absorbed rapidly and completely from the gut. The \ndrug is distributed throughout the body water and cleared by \nthe kidneys at a rate one fifth that of creatinine. The half-life of \nlithium is about 20 h. Plasma levels should be monitored, espe\u00ad\ncially during the first weeks of therapy, to establish an effective \nand safe dosage regimen. For acute symptoms, the target therapeu\u00ad\ntic plasma concentration is 0.8-1.2 mEq/L and for maintenance \n0.4-0.7 mEq/L. Plasma levels of the drug may be altered by \nchanges in body water. Dehydration, or treatment with thiazides, \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin\u00ad\nconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), and loop diuretics, may \nresult in an increase of lithium in the blood to toxic levels. Caf\u00ad\nfeine and theophylline increase the renal clearance of lithium. \nB. Mechanism of Action \nThe mechanism of action of lithium is not well defined. The drug \ninhibits several enzymes involved in the recycling of neuronal \nmembrane phosphoinositides. This action may result in depletion \nof the second-messenger source, phosphatidylinositol bisphos\u00ad\nphate (PIP:i), which, in turn, would decrease generation of ino\u00ad\nsitol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These second \nmessengers are important in amine neurotransmission, including \nthat mediated by central adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors \n(Figure29-1). Inhibition of glycogen synthasekinase-3 (GSK-3) is \nanother important result and inhibition of P-catenin, a messenger \ninvolved in insulin-like growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic \nfactor (BDNF), and the Wnt pathway, has been implicated. \nC. Clinical Use \nLithium carbonate continues to be used for the treatment of \nbipolar disorder (manic-depressive disease) although other drugs \nincluding some anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsy\u00ad\nchotics are equally effective (see text that follows). Maintenance \ntherapy with lithium decreases manic behavior and reduces both \nthe frequency and the magnitude of mood swings. Antipsychotic \nagents and/or benzodiazepines are commonly required at the initi\u00ad\nation of treatment because both lithium and valproate have a slow \nonset of action. Olanzapine, quetiapine, cariprazine, asenapine, CHAPTER 29 Antipsychotic & Bipolar Disorder Agents 247 \nReceptor \nFIGURE 29-1 Postulated effect oflithium on the inositol tri\u00ad\nsphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system. \nThe schematic diagram shows the synaptic membrane of a neuron \nin the brain. PLC, phospholipase C; G, coupling protein; Pl, PIP, PIP21 \nIP21 IP1, intermediates in the production of IP3\u2022 By interfering with \nthis cycle, lithium may cause a use-dependent reduction of synap-\ntic transmission . (Reproduced with permission from Katzung BG, \nVanderah TW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15th ed. New York, NY: \nMcGraw Hill; 2021.) \naripiprazole, risperidone, and ziprasidone are also approved for \nacute mania. \nAlthough lithium has protective effects against suicide and self\u00ad\nharm, antidepressant drugs are often used concurrently during \nmaintenance. Note that monotherapy with antidepressants can \nprecipitate mania in bipolar patients. \nD. Toxicity \nAdverse neurologic effects of lithium include tremor, sedation, \nataxia, and aphasia. Thyroid enlargement may occur, but hypo\u00ad\nthyroidism is rare. Reversible nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \noccurs commonly at therapeutic drug levels. Edema is a common \nadverse effect of lithium therapy; acneiform skin eruptions occur; \nand leukocytosis is always present. The issue of dysmorphogenesis \nis not settled. The use of lithium during pregnancy is thought to \nincrease the incidence of congenital cardiac anomalies (Ebstein \nanomaly). Recent analyses suggest that the teratogenic risk is low, \nbut in pregnancy it appears to contribute to low Apgar scores in \nthe neonate. Consequently, lithium should be withhdd 24-48 h \nbefore delivery, and its use is contraindicated in nursing mothers. \nE. Other Drugs Used in Bipolar Disorder \nThe manic phase in bipolar disorder can be treated with antipsy\u00ad\nchotic drugs (Table 29-3) as noted previously. Several antisei\u00ad\nzure drugs are used in bipolar disorder. Valproate has antimanic \neffects equivalent to those of lithium and is now widely used in the \nUnited States for this indication, often as a first choice in acute \nillness. V alproate may be effective in patients who fail to respond \nto lithium, and in some instances it has been used in combination \nwith lithium. The antiseizure drugs carbamazepine and lamotrig\u00ad\nine are also used both in acute mania and for prophylaxis in the \ndepressive phase. For more information on antiseizure drugs, \nsee Chapter 24."

Alpha, \n4, 5-HT;iA \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. CHAPTER 29 Antipsychotic & Bipolar Disorder Agents 249 \nANSWERS \n1. Although most first-generation antipsychotic drugs block D2 \nreceptors, this action is not a requirement for antipsychotic \naction. Aripiprazole, clozapine, and most newer second\u00ad\ngeneration drugs have a very low affinity for such receptors, \nbut a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. There are \nno reports of decreased serotonin receptors in the brains of \nschizophrenics. The CNS effects of phencyclidine (PCP) \nclosely parallel an acute schizophrenic episode, but PCP has \nno actions on brain dopamine receptors. Dopamine receptor \nblockers cause extrapyramidal dysfunction. The answer is C. \n2. Phenothiazines such as trifluoperazine cause sedation and \nare antagonists at muscarinic and a. adrenoceptors. Postural \nhypotension, blurring of vision, and dry mouth are com\u00ad\nmon autonomic adverse effects, as is constipation. Effects on \nthe male libido may result from increased prolactin or from \nincreased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. \nThe answer is C. \n3. Olanzapine has minimal dopamine receptor-blocking action \nand is unlikely to cause acute dystonias. Muscarinic block\u00ad\ners such as atropine exacerbate tardive dyskinesias. Akathi\u00ad\nsias (uncontrollable restlessness) resulting from antipsychotic \ndrugs may be relieved by a rtduction in dosage. Retinal pig\u00ad\nmentation may occur from treatment with thioridazine. \nThe answer is D. \n4. In addition to its use in schizophrenia and acute mania, halo\u00ad\nperidol has been used in the management of intoxication due \nto PCP and in Tourette syndrome. Hyperprolactinemia and \nthe amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome may occur as a4vtr1t \neffects during treatment with antipsychotic drugs, especially \nthose like haloperidol that strongly antagonize dopamine \nreceptors in the tuberoinfundibular tract. The answer is B. \n5. Clinical effects of lithium are slow in onset and may not be \napparent before 1 or 2 weeks of daily treatment. High urinary \nlevels of sodium inhibit renal tubular reabsorption of lithium, \nthus decreasing its plasma levels. Lithium clearance is decreased \nby distal tubule diuretics (eg, thiazides) because natriuresis \nstimulates a reflex increase in the proximal tubule reabsorp\u00ad\ntion of both lithium and sodium. Any drug that can cross the \nblood-brain barrier can cross the placental barrier! Teratogenic \nrisk is low, but use of lithium during pregnancy may contrib\u00ad\nute to low Apgar score in the neonate. The answer is C. \n6. Confusion, mood changes, decreased sexual interest, and \nweight gain are symptoms that may be unrelated to drug \nadministration. On the other hand, psychiatric drugs are \noften responsible for such symptoms. Tremor and symptoms \nof nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are characteristic adverse \neffects of lithium that may occur at blood levels within the \ntherapeutic range. The answer is C. \n7. Acute dystonic reactions are usually very painful and should \nbe treated immediately with parenteral administration of a \ndrug that blocks muscarinic receptors such as benztropine. \nAdding risperidone is not protective, and fluphenazine is as \nlikely as haloperidol to cause acute dystonia. Oral administra\u00ad\ntion of diphenhydramine is a possibility, but the patient may \nfind it difficult to swallow and it would take a longer time to \nact. The answer is D."

The amine hypothesis is largely based on \nstudies showing that many drugs capable of alleviating symptoms of \nmajor depressive disorders enhance the actions of the central nervous \nsystem (CNS) neurotransmitters 5-HT and NE. Difficulties with this \nhypothesis include the facts that (1) posnnortem studies of patients do \nnot reveal decreases in the brain levels of NE or 5-HT; (2) although \nantidepressant drugs may cause changes in brain amine activity within \nhours, clinical response requires weeks; (3) most antidepressants ulti\u00ad\nmatdy cause a doumregulation of amine receptors; (4) bupropion has \nminimal effects on brain NE or 5-HT; (5) brain-derived neurotrophic \nfuctor (BDNF) is depressed in the brains of depressed patients; (6) \nchronic use of antidepressants reduces glutamatergic transmission and \nkctamine, a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has a \nnotable, rapid, antidepressant action. \n252 5-HT-NE \nreuptake \ninhibitors \n(duloxetine, \nvenlafaxine) 5-HT \nantagonists \n(nefazodone, \ntrazodone) \n----~ L Selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors \n(escitalopram, \nfluoxetine, \nfluvoxamine, \nparoxetine, J \nsertraline) \nDRUG CLASSIFICATION & \nPHARMACOKINETICS \nA.

Heterocyclics \nThese drugs have varied structures and include the serotonin\u00ad\nnorepinepbrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRis, duloxetine, \nvcnlatUine, levomilnacipra.n), 5-HT2 receptor antagonists \n(nefuod.one, trazodone) and miscellaneous other heterocyclic \nagents including amoxapine, bupropion, maprotiline, and mir\u00ad\ntazapine. The pharmacokinetics of most of these agents are similar \nto those of the TCAs. N efazodone and trazodone are exceptions; \ntheir half-lives are short and usually require administration 2 or \n3 times daily. \nD. Monoamlne Oxldase Inhibitors \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOls; eg, phenelzine, tran\u00ad\nylcypromine) are structurally rdated to amphetamines and are \norally active. The older, standard drugs inhibit both MAO-A \n(monoamine oxidase type A), which metabolizes NE, 5-HT, \nand tyramine, and MAO-B (monoamine oxidase type B), which \nmetabolizes dopamine. Tranylcypromine is the fastest in onset of \neffect but has a shorter duration of action (about 1 week) than \nother MAOls (2-3 weeks). In spite of these prolonged actions, \nthe MAOis are given daily. They are inhibitors of hepatic drug\u00ad\nmetabolizing enzymes and cause drug interactions. Selegiline, \na selective inhibitor of MAO type B, was recently approved for \ntreatment of depression. \nE. Other Drugs With Antidepressant Actions \nAs mentioned earlier, ketamine, which is approved for dissocia\u00ad\ntive anesthesia, has been shown to have a prompt antidepressant \naction. When given as a single intravenous injection, its antide\u00ad\npressant effects may persist as long as one week. Recently a new, \nactive S( +) enantiomer of ketamine called esketamine became available for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults \nwho are treatment resistant. Esketamine is used as a nasal spray \nin conjunction with an oral antidepressant. It acts primarily as a \nnoncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist and may also block \nreuptake of dopamine. Esketamine undergoes extensive metabo\u00ad\nlism by the liver with a half-life of 2.5 h. Due to the risk of seri\u00ad\nous adverse outcomes resulting from sedation and dissociation, \nas well as the potential for abuse and misuse, esketamine is only \navailable under an FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy \n(REMS). In 2019, brexanolone (also known as allopregnanolone) \nwas approved for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) \nin adults. Brexanolone is given by continuous intravenous infu\u00ad\nsion over 60 hours with some patients experiencing excessive tired\u00ad\nness or sudden loss of consciousness. Brexanolone is also available \nunder the REMS program. \nMECHANISMS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT \nACTION \nPotential sites of action of antidepressants at CNS synapses are \nshown in Figure 30-1. By means of several mechanisms, most \nantidepressants cause potentiation of the neurotransmitter actions \nof NE, 5-HT, or both. However, nefazodone and trazodone are \nweak inhibitors of NE and 5-HT transporters, and their main \naction appears to be antagonism of the 5-HT 2A receptor. Long\u00ad\nterm use of tricyclics and MAOis, but not SSRis, leads to down\u00ad\nregu/ation of P adrenoceptors. \nA. Tricyclic Antidepressants \nThe acute effect of tricyclic drugs is to inhibit the reuptake trans\u00ad\nporters responsible for the termination of the synaptic actions of \nboth NE and 5-HT in the brain. This presumably results in poten\u00ad\ntiation of their neurotransmitter actions at synaptic receptors."

Inhibition of neuronal uptake ofnoreplnephrlne (NE) and serotonin (5-Hn \nincreases the synaptic activities of these neurotransmitters. lnh ibition of select S HT 2A serotonin receptors modulates certain 5-HT effects. I nhibi\u00ad\ntlon of monoamlne oxldase Increases the presynaptlc stores of both NE and 5-HT, wh lch leads to Increased neu rotransmltter effects. Blockade of \nthe presynaptic a:i autoreceptor prevents feedback inhibition of the release of NE. Note: These are acute actions of antidepressants. \nB. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors \nThe acute effect of SSRis is a highly selective action on the sero\u00ad\ntonin transporter (SERT). SSRis allosterically inhibit the trans\u00ad\nporter, binding at a site other than that of serotonin. They have \nminimal inhibitory effects on the NE transporter, or bloclcing \nactions on adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. \nC. Serotonln-Noreplnephrlne Reuptake Inhibitors \nSNRis bind to transporters for both serotonin and NE, presum\u00ad\nably enhancing the actions of both neurotransmitters . Venlafax\u00ad\nine has less affinity for the NE transporter than desvenlafaxine or \nduloxetine. The SNRis differ from the TCAs in lacking significant \nblocking effects on peripheral receptors; ie, they do not block his\u00ad\ntamine H1, muscarinic, or a-adrenergic receptors. \nD. Serotonin 5-HT 2 Receptor Antagonists \nThe major antidepressant actions of nefuzodone and trazodone \nappear to result from block of the 5-HT 2A receptor, a G-protein\u00ad\ncoupled receptor located in several CNS regions including the \nneocortex. Antagonism of this receptor is associated with both the \nantianxiety and antidepressant actions of these drugs. \nE. Other Heterocyclic Antidepressants \nMirtazapine has a unique action to increase amine release from \nnerve endings by antagonism of presynaptic <X:z adrenoceptors \ninvolved in feedback inhibition. The drug is also an antagonist \nat serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. The mechanism of antidepressant \naction ofbupropion is unknown-the drug has no effect on either \n5-HT or NE receptors or on amine transporters. F. Monoamlne Oxldase Inhibitors \nThe MAOis increase brain amine levels by interfering with their \nmetabolism in the nerve endings, resulting in an increase in the \nvesicular stores of NE and 5-HT. When neuronal activity dis\u00ad\ncharges the vesicles, increased amounts of the amines are released, \npresumably enhancing the actions of these neurotransmitters. \nPHARMACOLOGIC EFFECTS \nA. Amine Uptake Blockade \nThe drugs that block NE transporters in the CNS {eg, tricyclics, \nmaprotiline, venlafaxine) also inhibit the reuptake of NE at nerve \nendings in the autonomic nervous system. Likewise, MAOis \nincrease NE in sympathetic nerve terminals. In both cases, this can \nlead to peripheral autonomic sympathomimetic effects. However, \nchronic use of MAO Is can decrease blood pressure (Chapter 11). \nB. Sedation \nSedation is a common CNS effect of tricyclic drugs and some \nheterocyclic agents, especially mirtazapine and the 5-HT2 recep\u00ad\ntor antagonists nefazodone and trazodone {Table 30--1), the lat\u00ad\nter commonly prescribed for this purpose and as a sleeping aid. \nMAOis, SSRis, and bupropion are more likely to cause CNS\u00ad\nstimulating effects. \nC.

Because of more tolerable side effects and safety \nin overdose (sec later discussion), the newer drugs (SSRls, SNRis, \n5-HT ancagonists , and certain heterocyclics) are now the most \nwidely prescribed agents. However, none of the newer antidepres \u00ad\nsants have been shown to be more effective overall than tricyclic \ndrugs. As alternative agents, tricyclic drugs continue to be most \nuseful in patients with psychomotor retardation , sleep distur\u00ad\nbances, poor appetite, and weight loss. MAOis arc thought to be \nmost useful in patients with significant anxiety, phobic features, \nand hypochondriasis. Selegiline, the MAO type B inhibitor used \nin parkinsonism (see Chapter 28), is now available in a skin-patch \nformulation fur treatment of depression. SSRis, SNRls, and newer \nheterocyclics may increase suicide risk in children and adolescents. \nB. Other Cllnlcal Uses \nTC.As are also used in the treatment of migraine, bipolar affective \ndisorders, acute panic attacks, phobic disorders, enuresis, atten\u00ad\ntion deficit hyperactivity disorder, and chronic pain states. The \nSNRis (cg, duloxetine , venlafaxine) are effective in patients with \nneuropathic pain and fibromyalgia; duloxetine is also approved \nfor the pain of diabetic neuropathy . Clomipramine and the \nSSRis are effective in obsessive-compulsive disorders. SSRis are \napproved for patients who suffer from generalized anxiety dis\u00ad\norders, panic attacks, social phobias, post-traumatic stress dis\u00ad\norder (PTSD), bulimia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. \nBupropion is used for management of patients attempting to \nwithdraw from nicotine dependence and trazadone is often used \nfor its sedative effects. Hence, antidepressants have a broad spec\u00ad\ntrum of use in medicine. \nTOXICITY & DRUG INTERACTIONS \nA. Trlcydlc Antidepressants \nThe adverse effects of TC.As arc largely predictable from their phar\u00ad\nmacodynamic actions. These include (1) excessive sedation, lassi\u00ad\ntude, fatigue, and occasionally, confusion; (2) sympathomimetic \neffects, including tachycardia, agitation, sweating, and insomnia; \n(3) anticholinergic effects; (4) orthostatic hypotension, electrocar\u00ad\ndiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and cardiomyopathies; (5) tremor \nand paresthesias; and (6) weight gain. Overdosage with tricyclics is \nextremely hazardous, and the ingestion of as little as a 2-week sup\u00ad\nply has been lethal. Manifestations include (I) agitation, delirium, \nneuromuscular irritability , convulsions , and coma; (2) respiratory \ndepression and circulatoty collapse; (3) hyperpyrexia; and (4) car\u00ad\ndiac conduction defects and severe arrhythmias . The \"3 Cs\"\u00ad\ncoma, convulsions, and cardiotoxicity--Qfe characteristic. \nTricyclic drug interactions (Table 30-2) include additive \ndepression of the CNS with central depressants , including ethanol, \nbarbiturates , benzodiazep ines, and opioids. Tricyclics may also \ncause reversal of the antihypertensive action of guancthidine by \nblocking its transport into sympathetic nerve endings. Less com\u00ad\nmonly, tricyclics may interfere with the antihypertensiv e actions of \nmcthylnorcpinephrinc (the active metabolite of methyldopa) and \nclonidinc.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Toxicity \nFluoxetine and the other SSRis may cause nausea, headache, anxi\u00ad\nety, agitation, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Jittcriness can \nbe alleviated by starting with low doses or by adjunctive use of \nbcnzodiazepines. Extrapyramidal effects early in treatment may \ninclude akathisia, dyskinesias , and dystonic reactions. Seizures are \na consequence of gross overdosage . Cardiac effects of citalopram \noverdose include QT prolongation . A withdrawal syndrome has \nbeen described for SSRls, which includes nausea, dizziness, anxi\u00ad\nety, tremor, and palpitations. \nCertain SSRis are inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P450 iso\u00ad\nzymes, an action that has led to increased activity of other drugs, \nincluding TCAs and warfarin (Table 30-2). Fluoxetine inhibits \nCYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 isofurms; fluvoxamine \ninhibits CYP1A2 and paroxetine CYP2D6. Through its inhibi\u00ad\ntion of CYP2D6, fluoxetinc can increase plasma levels of several \ndrugs including dextromethorphan, propranolol , tamoxifcn, and \nthe TCAs. Citalopram causes fewer drug interactions than other \nSSRis. \nA serotonin syndrome was flrst described for an interaction \nbetween fluoxetine and an MAOI (sec later discussion). This life\u00ad\nthreatening syndrome includes severe muscle rigidity, myoclonus, \nhyperthermia, cardiovascular instability , and marked CNS stimula~ \ntory effects, including seizures. Drugs implicated include MAOis, \nTCAs, dextromethorphan, mcpcridinc, triptans, St. John's wort, \nand possibly illicit recreational drugs such as MOMA (\"ecstasy\"). \nAntiseizure drugs, muscle relaxants, blockers of 5-HT receptors \n(cg, cyproheptadine), and specifically dantrolene have been used \nin the management of the syndrome ; see also Table 16-2. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Amoxapine, maprotiline, mirtazapine, and trazodone \ncause some autonomic effects. Amoxapinc is also a dopamine \nreceptor blocker and may cause akathisia, parkinsonism, and the \namenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome. Adverse effects of bupropion \ninclude anxiety, agitation, dizziness, dry mouth, aggravation of \npsychosis, and, at high doses, seizures. Seizures and cardiotoxicity \nare prominent features of overdosagc with amoxapine and mapro\u00ad\ntilinc.

Though rare, nefazodonc has caused \nlife-threatening hepatotoxicity requiring liver transplantation . \nDuloxetine is also reported to cause liver dysfunction. \nD. MAOI Toxicity \nAdverse effects of the traditional MAOis include hypertensive reac\u00ad\ntions in response to indirectly acting sympathomimctics, hyperthcr\u00ad\nmia, and CNS stimulation leading to agitation and convulsions. \nHypertensive crisis may occur in patients taking MAOis who con\u00ad\nsume food that contains high concentrations of the indirect sympa\u00ad\nthomimetic tyramine. In the absence of indirect sympathomimetics, \nMAOis typically lower blood pressure; overdosage with these drugs \nmay result in shock, hyperthermia, and seizures.

All the statements are appropriate regarding the initiation of \ntreatment with sertraline or any other SSRI in a depressed \npatient. The SSRis have CNS-stimulating effects and may \ncause agitation, anxiety, \"the jitters,\" and insomnia, especially \nearly in treatment. Consequently, the evening is not the best \ntime to take SSRI drugs. The answer is E. \n2. The mechanism of action of bupropion is unknown, but the \ndrug does not inhibit either NE or 5-HT transporters. Lev\u00ad\nels of NE and 5-HT metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid \nof depressed patients before drug treatment are not higher \nthan normal. Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, the \nenzyme form that metaboli7.es dopamine (see Chapter 28). \nNefazodone is a highly selective antagonist at the 5-HT2 \nreceptor subtype. Downregulation of adrenoceptors appears to \nbe a common feature of chronic treatment of depression with \ntricyclic drugs such as amitripcyline. The answer is B. \n3. The SSRis (cg, fluoxetine) and venlafaxine (an SNRI) can \ncause sexual dysfunction with decreased libido, erectile dys\u00ad\nfunction, and anorgasmia. TCAs may also decrease libido \nor prevent ejaculation. Bupropion is the antidepressant \nleast likely to affect sexual performance. The drug is also purportedly useful in withdrawal from nicotine dependence, \nwhich could be helpful in this patient. The answer is B. \n4. No antidepressant has been shown to increase hepatic drug \nmetabolism. MAO inhibitors (not TCAs), though now \nused infrequently, are the drugs most likely to be effective in \ndepression with attendant anxiety, phobic features, and hypo\u00ad\nchondriasis. SSRis are usually associated with weight loss, at \nleast during the first 6 months of treatment. There is no evi\u00ad\ndence that any SSRI is more effective than another, or more \neffective overall than a tricyclic drug, in treatment of major \ndepressive disorder. The answer is E. \n5. Overdose with imipramine or any other tricyclic antidepres\u00ad\nsant drug is a medical emergency. The \"3 Cs\" -coma, convul\u00ad\nsions, and cardiac problems--are the most common causes of \ndeath. Widening of the QRS complex on the ECG is a major \ndiagnostic feature of cardiac toxicity. Arrhythmias resulting \nfrom cardiac toxicity require the use of drugs with the least \neffect on cardiac conductivity (cg, lidocaine). Hemodialysis \ndoes not increase the rate of elimination of tricyclic antide\u00ad\npressants in overdose. The answer is C. \n6. All of the drugs listed are effective hypnotic drugs, but only \ntrazodone is an antagonist at 5-HT2 receptors. Trazodone has \nwide use as a sleeping aid, especially in patients with symp\u00ad\ntoms of affective disorder. The answer is C. \n7. Older patients are more likely to be sensitive to antidepres\u00ad\nsant drugs that cause sedation, atropine-like adverse effects, \nor postural hypotension. Tricyclics and MAO inhibitors cause \nmany autonomic side effects; mirt.azapine and trazodone are \nhighly sedating. Citalopram (or another SSRI) is often the \nbest choice in such patients. The answer is B. \n8. The SSRis are not effective in chronic pain of neuropathic \norigin. All the other uses of SSRis are approved indications \nwith clinical effectiveness equivalent or superior to that of tri\u00ad\ncyclic drugs. In addition to treatment of chronic pain states \nand depression the tricyclics are also used to treat enuresis and \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The answer is B. \n9. Clomipramine, a tricyclic agent, is a more selective inhibi\u00ad\ntor of5-HT reuptake than other drugs in the tricyclic group. \nThis activity appears to be important in the treatment of \nobsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the SSRis have now \nbecome the drugs of choice for this disorder because they are \nsafer in overdose than tricyclics. The answer is C. \n10. Fluoxetine is an inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450s, espe\u00ad\ncially CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4. Dosages of \nseveral drugs may need to be reduced if given concomitantly \nwith fluoxetine. In the case of tamoxifen, however, its anti\u00ad\nneoplastic action is dependent on its conversion to an active \nmetabolite by CYP2D6. The answer is C. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Strength of Analgesia \nOn the basis of their relative abilities to relieve pain, the analgesic \nopioids may be classified as strong, moderate, and weak agonists. \nThis classification is independent of potency. Strong agonists vary \n260 markedly in potency; thus morphine is only one-hundredth as \npotent as fentanyl (0.1 mg fentanyl is as analgesic as 10 mg mor\u00ad\nphine), and is estimated to be less than one-thousandth as potent as \ncarfentanil, a veterinary large animal opioid that has recently been \ndetected as an adulterant in street heroin.

Ratio of Agonlst to Antagonist Effects \nOpioid drugs may be classified as agonists (full or partial recep\u00ad\ntor activators), antagonists {receptor blockers), or mixed agonist\u00ad\nantagonists, which are capable of activating one opioid receptor \nsubtype and blocking another subtype. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Absorption and Distribution \nMost drugs in this class are well absorbed when taken orally, hut \nmorphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone undergo extensive \nfirst-pass metabolism. In most cases, opioids can be given paren\u00ad\nterally, and sustained-rdease forms of some drugs are now avail\u00ad\nable, including morphine and oxycodone. Fentanyl is available as a \ntransdermal patch. Opioid drugs are widdy distributed to body tis\u00ad\nsues including the CNS. They cross the placental barrier and exert \neffects on the fetus that can result in both respiratory depression \nand, with continuous exposure, physical dependence in neonates. \nB. Metabolism \nWith few exceptions, the opioids are metabolized by hepatic \nenzymes, usually to inactive glucuronide conjugates, before their \nelimination by the kidney. However, morphine-6-glucuronide \nhas analgesic activity equivalent to that of morphine, and mor\u00ad\nphine-3-glucuronide (the primary metabolite) is neuroexcitatory. \nCodeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone are metaholiz.ed by cyto\u00ad\nchrome CYP2D6, an isozyme exhibiting genotypic variability. In \nthe case of codeine, this may be responsible for variability in analge\u00ad\nsic response because the drug is demethylated by CYP2D6 to form \nthe active metabolite, morphine. The ingestion of alcohol causes \nmajor increases in the peak serum levels of several opioids includ\u00ad\ning hydromorphone and oxymorphone. Meperidine is metabolized \nto normeperidine, which may cause seizures at high plasma levels. \nDepending on the specific drug, the duration of their analgesic \neffects ranges from 1-2 h (cg, fentanyl, sufentanil) to 6-8 h (eg, \nbuprenorphine). However, long-acting formulations of some drugs \nmay provide analgesia for 24 h or more. The dimination half-life of \nopioids increases in patients with liver or kidney disease. Remifent\u00ad\nanil (an ester) and alfentanil, congeners offentanyl, are metabolized \nrapidly and have very short half-lives (minutes to tens of minutes). \nMECHANISMS OF ACTION \nA. Receptors \nMany of the effects of opioid analgesics have been interpreted in \nterms of their interactions with specific receptors that endogenous peptides act upon in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Certain opi\u00ad\noid receptors are located on primary afferents and spinal cord pain \ntransmission neurons (ascending pathways) as well as on neurons in \nthe midbrain and medulla (descending pathwa}'li) that function in \npain modulation {Figure 31-1). Other opioid receptors that may \nbe involved in altering reactivity to pain are located on neurons in \nthe basal ganglia, the hypothalamus, the limbic structures, and the \ncerebral cortex. Three major opioid receptor subtypes have been \nextensively characterized pharmacologically: \u00b5 (mu), 5 (delta), \nand le (kappa) receptors. All three receptor subtypes appear to he \ninvolved in antinociceptive and analgesic mechanisms at both spi\u00ad\nnal and supraspinal levds. The \u00b5-receptor activation plays a major \nrole in the respiratory depressant actions of opioids and together \nwith le-receptor activation slows gastrointestinal transit; le-receptor \nactivation also appears to be involved in diuresis and sedation and \nhas d}'liphoric actions; &-receptor activation may play a role in \nthe development of tolerance. A receptor that appears to medi\u00ad\nate pronociceptive stimuli has been termed the orphanin opioid\u00ad\nreceptor-like subtype I (ORLI) receptor. It is activated by the \nendogenous peptide nociceptin, which is structurally related to \ndynorphin. \nB. Opioid Peptides \nOpioid receptors are thought to be activated by endogenous pep\u00ad\ntides under physiologic conditions. These peptides, which include \n~cndorpbin, cnkephalina, and dynorphina, are synthesized in \nthe neuronal cdl body and are transported to the nerve endings \nwhere they accumulate in synaptic vesicles. On rdease from nerve \nendings, they bind to opioid receptors and can he displaced from \nbinding by opioid antagonists. Endorphins have highest affinity \nfor \u00b5 receptors, enkephalins for 5 receptors, and dynorphins for \nle receptors. Although it remains unclear whether these peptides \nfunction as classic neurotransmitters, they appear to modulate \ntransmission at many sites in the brain, spinal cord, and in primary \nafferents. Opioid peptides are also found in the adrenal medulla \nand neural plexus of the gut. \nC. Receptor Mechanisms \nOpioid analgesics inhibit synaptic activity partly through direct \nactivation of opioid receptors and partly through release of the"

            "Text": "mixed agonist-antagonist actions (eg, buprenorphine, see below) \nmay antagonize the analgesic actions of full agonists and should \nnot be used concomitantly. Codeine, hydrocodone, and oxyc:o\u00ad\ndone are partial agonists with mild to moderate analgesic efficacy. \nThey are commonly available in combinations with acetamino\u00ad\nphen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Pro\u00ad\npoxyphene, a very weak agonist drug, is also available combined \nwith acetaminophen. \nB. Sedation and Euphoria \nThese effects may occur at doses lower than those required for \nmaximum analgesia. The sedation is additive with other CNS \ndepressants, but there is little amnesia. Some patients experience \ndysphoric effects most often from kappa opioid drugs. At higher \ndoses, the drugs may cause mental clouding and result in a stupor\u00ad\nous, or even a comatose state. \nC. Respiratory Depression \nOpioid actions in the medulla lead to inhibition of the respira\u00ad\ntory center, with decreased response to carbon dioxide challenge. \nDepression may be less marked with 1C receptor-selective agonists. \nWith full agonists, respiratory depression may be seen at conven\u00ad\ntional analgesic doses. Increased Pco2 may cause cerebrovascular \ndilation, resulting in increased blood flow and increased intracra\u00ad\nnial pressure. Hence, opioid analgesics are relatively contraindi\u00ad\ncated in patients with head injuries. \nD. Antitussive Actions \nSuppression of the cough reflex by unknown mechanisms is the \nbasis for the clinical use of opioids as antitussives. This action can \nbe obtained with the use of doses lower than those needed for \nanalgesia. \nE. Nausea and Vomiting \nNausea and vomiting are caused by opioid activation of the che\u00ad\nmoreceptor trigger zone and are increased by ambulation. \nF. Gastrointestinal Effects \nConstipation occurs through decreased intestinal peristalsis, \nwhich is probably mediated by effects on opioid receptors in the \nenteric nervous system. This powerful action is the basis for the \nclinical use of these drugs as antidiarrheal agents. Loperamide and \ndiphenoxylate are weak \u00b5 opioid agonists that are designed to \neither not cross the blood brain barrier or be combined with atro\u00ad\npine, respectively, for the treatment of diarrhea. \nG. Smooth Muscle \nOpioids (with the exception of meperidine) cause contraction of \nbiliary tract smooth muscle, which can result in biliary colic or \nspasm, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, but a reduc\u00ad\ntitm in uterine tone, which may contribute to prolongation oflabor. \nH. Mlosls \nPupillary constriction (miosis) is a characteristic effect of all opi\u00ad\noids except meperidine, which has a muscarinic blocking action. CHAPTER 31 Opioid Analgesics & Antagonists 263 \nLlttle or no tolerance to the miosis occurs. Miosis is blocked by the \nopioid antagonist naloxone and by atropine. \nI. Miscellaneous \nTruncal rigidity occurs in response to several opioids and can cause \nsignificant resistance to mechanical ventilation. Opioid analgesics, \nespecially morphine, can cause flushing and pruritus through his\u00ad\ntamine release. They cause release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) \nand prolactin but may inhibit the release of luteinizing hormone \n(LH). Exaggerated responses to opioid analgesics may occur in \npatients with adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. \nSKILL KEEPER: OPIOID PEPTIDES AND \nSUBSTANCE P (SEE CHAPTERS 6 AND 17) \nThese peptides are relevant to understanding the analgesic \nactions of opioid analgesic drugs in terms of CNS function. \nWhat are the roles of these peptides in peripheral tissues? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nCHRONIC EFFECTS \nA. Tolerance \nMarked tolerance can develop to the just-mentioned acute phar\u00ad\nmacologic effects, with the exception of miosis and constipation. \nThe mechanism of opioid tolerance development may involve \nreceptor uncoupling. Antagonists of glutamate N-methyl-o\u00ad\naspartate (NMDA) receptors (eg, ketamine}, as well as &-receptor \nantagonists, are reported to block opioid tolerance. Although there \nis cross-tolerance between different opioid agonists, it is not com\u00ad\nplete. This provides the basis for \"opioid rotation,\" whereby anal\u00ad\ngesia is maintained (eg, in cancer patients) by changing from one \ndrug to another. \nB. Dependence \nPhysical dependence is an anticipated physiologic response to \nchronic therapy with drugs in this group, particularly the strong \nagonists. Physical dependence is revealed on abrupt discontinuance \nas an abstinence syndrome, which includes rhinorrhea, lacrima\u00ad\ntion, chills, gooseflesh, muscle aches, diarrhea, yawning, anxiety, \nand hostility. A more intense state of precipitated withdrawal \nresults when an opioid antagonist is administered to a physically \ndependent individual. \nC. Hyperalgesia \nWhen used for a prolonged period, some opioids, including mor\u00ad\nphine, fentanyl, and remifentanil, may exacerbate pain. Release of \ndynorphin in the spinal cord and increased inflammatory factors \nas well as activation of bradykinin and NMDA receptors may be \nresponsible for this very undesirable effect."

            "Text": "264 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nCLINICAL USES \nA. Analgesia \nTreatment of relatively constant moderate to severe pa.in (eg, frac\u00ad\ntures, cancer pa.in, etc) is the major indication. Although paren\u00ad\nteral and oral formulations are most commonly used, buccal and \nsuppository forms of some drugs are available. In the acute setting, \nstrong agonists are usually given parenterally. Prolonged analgesia, \nwith some reduction in adverse effects, can be achieved with epi\u00ad\ndural administration of certain strong agonist drugs (eg, fentanyl \nand morphine). Fentanyl has also been used by the transdermal \nroute providing analgesia for up to 72 h. For less severe pa.in and in \nthe chronic setting, moderate agonists are given by the oral route, \nsometimes in combinations with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. \nB. Cough Suppression \nUseful oral antitussive drugs include codeine and dextromethor\u00ad\nphan. The latter, an over-the-counter drug, has recently been the \nsubject of FDA warnings regarding its abuse potential. Large doses \nof dextromethorphan may cause hallucinations, confusion, excita\u00ad\ntion, increased or decreased pupil size, nystagmus, seizures, coma, \nand decreased ventilation. These effects are due to dextromethor\u00ad\nphan acting at a multitude of additional sites including glutamate \nreceptors and sigma receptors, and inhibiting reuptake of sero\u00ad\ntonin and norepinephrine. \nC. Treatment of Diarrhea \nSelective antidiarrheal opioids include diphenoxylate and loper\u00ad\namide. Diphenoxylate is mixed with atropine to help prevent its \nmisuse whereas loperamide (unscheduled) does not effectively \ncross the blood-bra.in barrier. These agents also interact with other \nreceptor types. They are given orally. \nD. Management of Acute Pulmonary Edema \nMorphine (parenteral) may be useful in acute pulmonary edema \nbecause of its hemodynamic actions; its calming effects probably \nalso contribute to relief of the pulmonary symptoms. \nE. Anesthesia \nOpioids are used as preoperative medications, and as intraopera\u00ad\ntive adjunctive agents in balanced anesthesia protocols. High-dose \nintravenous opioids (eg, morphine, fentanyl) are often the major \ncomponent of anesthesia for cardiac surgery. \nF. Opioid Dependence \nMethadone, one of the longer acting opioids, as well as Suboxone, \na mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone, are used in the manage\u00ad\nment of opioid withdrawal states and in maintenance programs for \naddicts. In withdrawal states, methadone permits a slow tapering \nof opioid effect that diminishes the intensity of abstinence symp\u00ad\ntoms. Buprenorphine (see later discussion) has an even longer \nduration of action and is sometimes used in withdrawal states. In \nmaintenance programs, the prolonged action of methadone blocks \nthe euphoria-inducing effects of doses of shorter acting opioids \n(eg, heroin, morphine). TOXICITY \nMost of the adverse effects of the opioid analgesics (eg, nausea, \nconstipation, respiratory depression) are predictable extensions of \ntheir pharmacologic effects. In addition, overdose and drug inter\u00ad\naction toxicities are very imponant. \nA.overdose \nA triad of pupillary constriction, comatose state, and respiratory \ndepression is characteristic; the latter is responsible for most fatali\u00ad\nties. Diagnosis of overdosage is confirmed if intravenous injec\u00ad\ntion or nasal insufflation of naloxone, an antagonist of the opioid \nreceptors, results in prompt signs of recovery. Treatment of over\u00ad\ndose involves the use of antagonists such as naloxone and other \ntherapeutic measures, especially ventilatory support. \nB. Drug Interactions \nThe most imponant drug interactions involving opioid analgesics \nare additive CNS depression with ethanol, sedative-hypnotics, \nanesthetics, antipsychotic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and \nantihistamines. Concomitant use of certain opioids (eg, meperi\u00ad\ndine) with monoamine oxidase inhibitors increases the incidence \nof hyperpyrexic coma. Meperidine, tramadol, and tapentadol have \nalso been implicated in the serotonin syndrome when used with \nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRis). \nAGONIST-ANTAGONIST DRUGS \nA. Analgesic Activity \nThe analgesic activity of mixed agonist-antagonists varies with the \nindividual drug but is somewhat less than that of strong full ago\u00ad\nnists like morphine. Bupreoorphine, butorphanol, and nalbu\u00ad\nphine afford greater analgesia than pentazocine, which is similar \nto codeine in analgesic efficacy. \nB. Receptors \nButorphanol, nalbuphine, and pentazocine are x: agonists, with \nweak p.-receptor agonistlantagonist activity. Butorphanol, buprenor\u00ad\nphine, and nalbuphine tend to act more as a partial agonist at the \np. receptor whereas pentazocine acts more as an antagonist at the p. \nreceptor. \nBuprenorphine is a p.-receptor partial agonist with weak antag\u00ad\nonist effects at 1C and 5 receptors. These characteristics can lead \nto decreased analgesia, or even precipitate withdrawal symptoms, \nwhen such drugs are used in patients taking conventional full \np.-receptor agonists. Buprenorphine has a long duration of effect, \nbinding strongly to p. receptors. Although prolonged activity of \nbuprenorphine may be clinically useful ( eg, to suppress withdrawal \nsigns in dependency states), this property renders its effects resis\u00ad\ntant to naloxone reversal, since the antagonist drug has a short \nhalf-life. In overdose, respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine \nmay also be resistant to naloxone reversal. Naloxone is included \nin some formulations (ie, Suboxone) of these agonist-antagonist \ndrugs to discourage abuse. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "C. Effects \nThe mixed agonist-antagonist drugs often cause sedation at anal\u00ad\ngesic doses. Dizziness, sweating, and nausea may also occur, and \nanxiety, hallucinations, and nightmares are possible adverse effects. \nRespiratory depression may be less intense than with pure agonists \nbut is not predictably reversed by naloxone. Tolerance develops \nwith chronic use hut is less than the tolerance that develops to the \nfull agonists, and there is minimal crosMolerance. Physical depen\u00ad\ndence occurs, but the abuse liability of mixed agonise-antagonist \ndrugs is less than that of the full agonises. \nD. Miscellaneous \nTramadol is a moderate to weak \u00b5-receptor agonise only partially \nantagonized by naloxone. Its analgesic activity is mainly based on \nblockade of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. T rama\u00ad\ndol is effective in treatment of moderate pain and has been used \nas an adjunct to opioid analgesics in chronic pain syndromes. The \ndrug is relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of sei\u00ad\nzure disorders, and there is risk of the serotonin syndrome if it is \nco-administered with SSRis. No significant effects on cardiovascu\u00ad\nlar functions or respiration have been reported. \nTapentadol has strong norepinephrine reuptake-inhibiting \nactivity (blocked by a. antagonists) and only modest \u00b5-opioid \nreceptor affinity. It is less effective than oxycodone in the treat\u00ad\nment of moderate to severe pain but causes less gastrointestinal dis\u00ad\ntress and nausea. T apentadol has been implicated in the serotonin \nsyndrome and should be used with caution in seizure disorders. \nOPIOID ANTAGONISTS \nNalomne, nalmefcne, and naltraonc are pure opioid recep\u00ad\ntor antagonists that have few other effects at doses that produce \nmarked inhibition of agonise effects. These drugs have greater \naffinity for \u00b5 receptors than for other opioid receptors. A major \nclinical use of the opioid antagonists is in the management of acute \nopioid overdose. Naloxone and nalmefene are given intravenously. \nBecause naloxone has a short duration of action (1-2 h), mul\u00ad\ntiple doses may be required in opioid analgesic overdose. A nasal \ninsuffiation preparation of naloxone has recently been made avail\u00ad\nable to first responders who must treat opioid overdose promptly. \nNalmefene has a duration of action of 8-12 h. Naltrexone has a \nlong elimination half-life, blocking the actions of strong agonises \n(eg, heroin) for up to 48 h after oral use. Naltrexone decreases the \ncraving for ethanol and is approved for adjunctive use in alcohol \ndependency programs. U nli.ke the older drugs, two new antago\u00ad\nnists, methylnaltraonc and alvimopan, do not cross the blood\u00ad\nbrain harrier. These agents block adverse effects of strong opioids \non peripheral \u00b5 receptors, including those in the gastrointestinal \ntract responsible for constipation, with minimal effects on anal\u00ad\ngesic actions and without precipitating an abstinence syndrome. \nNaloxcgol, a pegylated form of naloxone, is also used to reverse \nopioid constipation. CHAPTER 31 Opioid Analgesics & Antagonists 265 \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions l and 2. A 63-year-old man is undergoing radiation \ntreatment as an outpatient for metastatic bone cancer. His pain \nhas been created with a fixed combination of oxycodone plus acet\u00ad\naminophen taken orally. Despite increasing doses of the analgesic \ncombination, the pain is getting worse. \nl. The most appropriate oral medication for relief of his increas\u00ad\ning pain is \n(A) Buprenorphine \n(B) Codeine plus aspirin \n(C) Hydromorphone \n(D) Pentazocine \n(E) Tramadol \n2. It is possible that this patient will have to increase the dose of \nthe analgesic as his condition progresses as a result of develop\u00ad\ning tolerance. However, tolerance will not develop to a signifi\u00ad\ncant extent with respect to \n(A) Biliary smooth muscle \n(B) Emesis \n(C) Pupillary constriction \n(D) Sedation \n(E) Urinary retention \n3.

He informs the \nattending physician that he uses \"street drugs\" and that he gave \nhimself an intravenous \"fix\" approximately 12 h ago. After an \ninitial period of contentment and relaxation, he now has chills and \nmuscle aches and has also been vomiting. His symptoms include \nhyperventilation and hyperthermia. The attending physician \nnotes that his pupil size is larger than normal. \n6. What is the most likely cause of these signs and symptoms? \n(A) The patient had injected dextroamphetamine \n(B) The patient has hepatitis B \n(C) The patient has overdosed with an opioid \n(D) The signs and symptoms are those of the opioid absti\u00ad\nnence syndrome \n(E) These are early signs of toxicity due to contaminants in \n\"street heroin\" \n7. Which drug will be most effective in alleviating the symptoms \nexperienced by this patient? \n(A) Buprenorphine \n(B) Codeine \n(C) Methadone \n(D) Naltrcxone \n(E) Tramadol \n8. Which statement about nalbuphine is most accurate? \n(A) Activates \u00b5 receptors \n(B) Does not cause respiratory depression \n(C) Is a nonsedating opioid \n(D) Pain-relieving action is not superior to that of codeine \n(E) Response to naloxone in overdose may be unreliable \n9. Which drug does not activate opioid receptors, has been pro\u00ad\nposed as a maintenance drug in treatment programs fur opi\u00ad\noid addicts, and with a single oral dose, will block the effects \nof injected heroin fur up to 48 h? \n(A) Fentanyl \n(B) Nalbuphine \n(C) Naloxone \n(D) Naltrcxone \n(E) Propoxyphene \n10. Which drug is a full agonist at opioid receptors with analgesic \nactivity equivalent to morphine, a longer duration of action, \nand fewer withdrawal signs on abrupt discontinuance than \nmorphine? \n(A) Fentanyl \n(B) Hydromorphone \n(C) Methadone \n(D) Nalbuphine \n(E) Oxycodone \nANSWERS \n1. In most situations, pain associated with metastatic carcinoma \nultimately necessitates the use of an opioid analgesic that is \nequivalent in strength to morphine, so hydromorphone, oxy\u00ad\nmorphone, or levorphanol would be indicated. Pentazocine \nor the combination of codeine plus salicylate would not be \nas effective as the original drug combination. Propoxyphene \nis even less active than codeine alone. Buprenorphine, a \nmixed agonist-antagonist, is not usually recommended fur cancer-associated pain because it has a limited maximum \nanalgesic effect (\"ceiling\") and because of possible dysphoric \nand psychotomimetic effects. The answer is C. \n2. Chronic use of strong opioid analgesics leads to the develop\u00ad\nment of tolerance to their analgesic, euphoric, and sedative \nactions. Tolerance also develops to their emetic effects and \nto effects on some smooth muscle, including the biliary and \nthe urethral sphincter muscles. However, tolerance does not \ndevelop significantly to the constipating effects or the miotic \nactions of the opioid analgesics. The answer is C. \n3. Codeine and nalbuphine could decrease gastrointestinal \nperistalsis, but not without marked side effects (and a pre\u00ad\nscription). Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant. The \nother 2 drugs listed are opioids with antidiarrheal actions. \nDiphenoxylate is not available over the counter because it is a \nconstituent of a proprietary combination that includes atro\u00ad\npine sulfate {Lomotil). The answer is D. \n4. Concomitant administration of meperidine and monoamine \noxidase inhibitors such as isocarboxazid or phenelzine has \nresulted in life-threatening hyperpyrexic reactions that may cul\u00ad\nminate in seizures or coma. Such reactions have occurred even \nwhen the MAO inhibitor was administered more than a week \nafter a patient had been treated with meperidine. Note that \nconcomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and \nmeperidine has resulted in the serotonin syndrome, another life.. \nthreatening drug interaction (see Chapter 16). The answer is D. \n5. Codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone are metabolized by \nthe cytochrome P450 isofurm CYP206, and variations in \nanalgesic response to these drugs have been attributed to geno\u00ad\ntypic polymorphisms in this isozyme. In the case of codeine, \nthis may be especially important since the drug is demethyl\u00ad\nated by CYP206 to form the active metabolite, morphine \n(see Chapter 5). An ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine given a \nnormal dose may suffer symptoms of severe opioid overdose. \nThe answer is B. \n6. The signs and symptoms are those of withdrawal in a patient \nphysically dependent on an opioid agonist, especially mor\u00ad\nphine or heroin. They usually start within 6-10 h after the \nlast dose; their intensity depends on the degree of physi\u00ad\ncal dependence, and peak effects usually occur at 36--48 h. \nMydriasis is a prominent feature of the abstinence syndrome; \nother symptoms include rhinorrhca, lacrimation, piloercction, \nmuscle jerks, and yawning. An overdose of dextroamphet\u00ad\namine would not produce an initial feeling of contentment \nand relaxation. The answer is D. \n7. Prevention of signs and symptoms of withdrawal after chronic \nuse of a strong opiate like heroin requires replacement with \nanother strong opioid analgesic drug. Methadone is most \ncommonly used, but other strong \u00b5-receptor agonists would \nalso be effective. Acetaminophen and codeine will not be \neffective. Beneficial effects of diazepam are restricted to relief \nof anxiety and agitation. The antagonist drug naltrexone may \nexacerbate withdrawal symptoms. The answer is C. \n8. Nalbuphine and butorphanol are 1C agonists, with weak \n\u00b5-receptor antagonist activity. They have analgesic efficacy \nsuperior to that of codeine, but not equivalent to that of \nstrong \u00b5-receptor agonists. Although these mixed agonist\u00ad\nantagonist drugs are less likdy to cause respiratory depres\u00ad\nsion than strong J.l activators, if depression does occur, reversal \nwith opioid antagonists such as naloxone is unpredictable. \nSedation is common.

Seizures are not uncommon and may \nbe life-threatening. \nTreatment of sedative-hypnotic withdrawal involves adminis\u00ad\ntration of a long acting sedative-hypnotic (eg, chlordiazepoxide \nTABLE 32-2 Signs and symptoms of overdose and \nwithdrawal from selected drugs of abuse. \nAmphetamines, \nmethylphenidate, \ncocaine\" \nBarbiturates, benzo\u00ad\ndiazepines, ethanolb \nHeroin, other strong \nopioids Agitation, hyperten\u00ad\nsion, tachycardia, \ndelusions, hallucina\u00ad\ntions, hyperthermia, \nseizures, death \nSlurred speech, \ndrunken behavior, \ndilated pupils, weak \n;md rapid pulse, \ndammy skin, shallow \nrespiration, coma, \ndeath \nConstricted puplls, \nclammy skin, nausea, \ndrowsiness, respira\u00ad\ntory depression, \ncoma, death Wlthdrawal \nSymptoms \nApathy, Irritabil-\nity, increased sleep \ntime, disorientation, \ndepression \nAnxiety, insomnia, \ndelirium, tremors, \nseizures, death \nNausea, chills, \ncramps, lacrimation, \nrhlnorrhea, yawning, \nhyperpnea, tremor \n\"Cardiac arrhythmias, myocardlal Infarction, and stroke occur more frequently ln \ncocaine overdose. \nbEthanol withdrawal Includes the excited hallucfnatory state of dellrfum tremens.

Oonidine or propranolol may \nalso he of value to suppress sympathetic overactivity. The opioid \nreceptor antagonist naltrexone, and a.cam.pro.sate, an antagonist \nat N-methyl-o-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, are both \nused in the treatment of alcoholism (see Chapter 23). \nA syndrome of therapeutic withdrawal has occurred on dis\u00ad\ncontinuance of sedative-hypnotics after long-term therapeutic \nadministration. In addition to the symptoms of classic withdrawal \npresented in Table 32-2, this syndrome includes weight loss, par\u00ad\nesthesias, and headache. (See Chapters 22 and 23 for additional \ndetails.) \nOPIOID ANALGESICS \nA. Effects \n& described in Chapter 31, the primary targets underlying the \nactions of the opioid analgesics are the \u00b5, K, and ~ receptors. \n\u00b5-Opioid receptor activation results in euphoria while K receptor \nactivation results in dysphoria. However, the opioids have other \nactions including disinhihition in dopaminergic pathways in the \nCNS. The most commonly abused drugs in this group are heroin, \nmorphine, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, meperidine, \nand fcntanyl. The effects of intravenous heroin are described by \nabusers as a \"rush\" or orgasmic feeling followed by euphoria and \nthen sedation. Intravenous administration of opioids is associated \nwith rapid development of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. \nOral administration or smoking of opioids causes milder effects, \nwith a slower onset of tolerance and dependence. Overdose of opi\u00ad\noids leads to respiratory depression progressing to coma and death \n(Table 32-2). Overdose is managed with parenteral naloxone or \nnalmefene and ventilatory support. Kratom, a crude plant extract \nwith poorly defined opioid effects, has apparently been misused by \nmany because it is available as a botanical over a counter. \nB. Withdrawal \nDeprivation of opioids in physiologically dependent individuals \nleads to an abstinence syndrome that includes lacrimation, rhinor\u00ad\nrhea, yawning, sweating, weakness, gooseflesh {\"cold turkey\"), nau\u00ad\nsea and vomiting, tremor, muscle jerks (\"kicking the habit\"), and \nhyperpnea (Table 32-2). Although extremely unpleasant, with\u00ad\ndrawal from opioids is rarely fatal (unlike withdrawal from sedative-\u00ad\nhypnotics). Treatment involves replacement of the illicit drug with \na pharmacologically equivalent agent (eg, methadone), followed by \nslow dose reduction. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist at \u00b5 opioid \nreceptors and a longer acting opioid (half-life >40 h}, is also used \nto suppress withdrawal symptoms and as substitution therapy for \nopioid addicts. The administration of naloxone to a person who is \nusing strong opioids {but not overdosing} may cause more rapid \nand more intense symptoms of withdrawal (precipitated with\u00ad\ndrawal). Neonates born to mothers physiologically dependent \non opioids (neonatal abstinence) require special management of \nwithdrawal symptoms to prevent serious adverse events includ\u00ad\ning seizures, breathing problems, and even sudden infant death \nsyndrome."

            "Text": "272 PART V Drugs That Act in the Central Nervous System \nSTIMULANTS \nA. Caffeine and Nicotine \nf. Effects-Caffeine (in beverages) and nicotine (in tobacco or \n\"vaping\" products) are legal in most Western cultures even though \nthey have adverse medical effects. In the United States, cigarette \nsmoking is a major preventable cause of death; tobacco use is \nassociated with a high incidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, \nand neoplastic disease. Addiction (psychological dependence) to \ncaffeine and nicotine has been recognized for some time. More \nrecently, demonstration of abstinence signs and symptoms has \nprovided evidence of dependence. \n2. Withdrawal-Withdrawal from caffeine is accompanied \nby lethargy, irritability, and headache. The anxiety and mental \ndiscomfort experienced from discontinuing nicotine are major \nimpediments to quitting the habit. Varenidine, a partial agonist \nat the a4j32 subtype nicotinic receptors, and nicotine replace\u00ad\nment therapy (cg, nicotine patches and gum) both help occlude \nthe rewarding effects of nicotine, and are used for smoking cessa\u00ad\ntion. Bupropion, an antidepressant (see Chapter 30), has also been \napproved for nicotine cessation. \n3. Toxicity-Acute toxicity from overdosage of caffeine or nico\u00ad\ntine includes excessive CNS stimulation with tremor, insomnia, \nand nervousness; cardiac stimulation with arrhythmias; and, in \nthe case of nicotine, respiratory paralysis (see Chapters 6 and 7). \nSevere toxicity has been reported in small children who ingest dis\u00ad\ncarded nicotine gum or nicotine patches or vaping solutions which \nare used as substitutes for tobacco products. \nB. Amphetamines \nf. Effects-Amphetamines alter amine transporter activity of \nthe CNS including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, \nand can increase their release (see Chapter 9). They cause a feel\u00ad\ning of euphoria and self-confidence that contributes to the rapid \ndevelopment of addiction. Drugs in this class include datroam\u00ad\nphetamine and methamphetamine (\"speed\"), a crystal form of \nwhich (\"ice\") can be smoked. Chronic high-dose abuse leads to \na psychotic state (with delusions and paranoia) that is difficult to \ndifferentiate from schizophrenia. Symptoms of overdose include \nagitation, restlessness, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, \nand possibly seizures (Table 32-2). There is no specific antidote, \nand supportive measures are directed toward control of body tem\u00ad\nperature and protection against cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. \nChronic abuse of amphetamines is associated with the develop\u00ad\nment of necrotizing arteritis, leading to cerebral hemorrhage and \nrenal failure. \n2. Tolerance and withdrawal-Tolerance can be marked, \nand an abstinence syndrome, characterized by increased appetite, \nsleepiness, exhaustion , and mental depression, can occur on with\u00ad\ndrawal. Antidepressant drugs may be indicated for treatment of \nwithdrawal-induced depression. 3. Congeners of amphetamines-Several chemical congeners \nof amphetamines have hallucinogenic properties. These include \n2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM [STP]), methylene \ndioxyamphetamine (MDA), and methylene dioxymethamphet\u00ad\namine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\"). MDMA has a more selective action \nthan amphetamine on the serotonin transporter in the CNS. The \ndrug is purported to facilitate interpersonal communication and \nact as a sexual enhancer. Positron emission tomography studies of \nthe brains of regular users ofMDMA show a depletion of neurons \nin serotonergic tracts. Overdose toxicity includes hypenhermia, \nsymptoms of the serotonin syndrome (see Chapter 30), and sei\u00ad\nzures. A withdrawal syndrome with protracted depression has been \ndescribed in chronic users of MDMA. \nC.Cocaine \n1. Effects-Cocaine, an inhibitor of the CNS transporters of dopa\u00ad\nmine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, has marked amphetamine\u00ad\nlike effects (\"super-speed\"). Its abuse continues to be widespread \nin the United States partly because of the availability of a free-base \nform (\"crack\") that can be smoked. The euphoria, self-confidence, \nand mental alertness produced by cocaine are short-lasting and \npositively reinforce its continued use. \nOverdoses with cocaine commonly result in fatalities from \narrhythmias, seizures, or respiratory depression (see Table 32-2). \nCardiac toxicity is partly due to blockade of norepinephrine \nreuptake by cocaine; its local anesthetic action contributes to the \nproduction of seizures. In addition, the powerful vasoconstric\u00ad\ntive action of cocaine may lead to severe hypertensive episodes, \nresulting in myocardial infarcts and suokes. No specific antidote \nis available. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is associated with \nincreased fetal morbidity and mortality. \n2. Withdrawal- The abstinence syndrome associated with \nwithdrawal from cocaine is similar to that after amphetamine dis\u00ad\ncontinuance. Severe depression of mood is common and strongly \nreinforces the compulsion to use the drug. Antidepressant drugs \nmay be indicated. Infants born to mothers who abuse cocaine (or \namphetamines) have possible teratogenic abnormalities (cystic \ncortical lesions) and increased morbidity and mortality and may \nbe cocaine dependent. The signs and symptoms of CNS stimulant \noverdose and withdrawal are listed in Table 32-2. \nHALLUCINOGENS \nA. Phencyclidine \nThe arylcyclohexylamine drugs include phencyclidine (PCP; \n\"angel dust\") and ketamine (\"special K\"), which are antagonists \nat the glutamate NMDA receptor (see Chapter 21). Unlike most \ndrugs of abuse, they have no actions on dopaminergic neurons \nin the CNS. PCP is probably the most dangerous of the halluci\u00ad\nnogenic agents. Psychotic reactions are common with PCP, and \nimpaired judgment often leads to reckless behavior. This drug \nshould be classified as a psychotomimetic. Effects of overdosage \nwith PCP include both horizontal and vertical nystagmus, marked \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "hypertension, and seizures, which may be fatal. Parenteral benzo\u00ad\ndiazepines (eg, diazepam, lorazepam) are used to curb excitation \nand protect against seizures. \nB. Miscellaneous Hallucinogenic Agents \nSeveral drugs with hallucinogenic effects have been classified as \nhaving abuse liability, including lysergic acid diethylamide \n(LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin. Hallucinogenic effects may \nalso occur with scopolamine and other antimuscarinic agents. \nNone of these drugs has actions on dopamincrgic pathways in the \nCNS and, interestingly, they do not cause dependence. Terms that \nhave been used to describe the CNS effects of such drugs include \n\"psychedelic\" and \"mind revealing.\" The perceptual and psycho\u00ad\nlogical effects of such drugs are usually accompanied by marked \nsomatic effects, particularly nausea, weakness, and paresthesias. \nPanic reactions (\"bad trips\") may also occur. \nMARIJUANA \nA. Classlflcatlon \nMarijuana (\"grass\" or \"pot\") is a collective term for the psychoac\u00ad\ntive constituents in crude extracts of the plant Cannabis sativa and \nC indica, the active principles of which include the cannabinoid \ncompounds tetrabydroc:annabinol (TIIC), cannabidiol (CBD), \nand cannabinol (CBN). The Cannabis sativa plant has further sub\u00ad\nspecies that include the hemp plant, which has low levels of THC \nand high levels of CBD, and medical marijuana flowering/bud \nplants, which tend to have higher THC vs CBD levels. Hashish is \na partially purified THC-containing material that is more potent. \nB. cannabinoids \nEndogenous cannabinoids in the CNS, which include anan\u00ad\ndamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol, are released postsynaptically \nand act as retrograde messengers to inhibit presynaptic release of \nconventional transmitters including dopamine. The receptors for \nthese compounds are thought to be the targets for exogenous can\u00ad\nnabinoids present in marijuana. \nC. Effects \nCNS effects of marijuana include a feeling of being \"high,\" with \neuphoria, disinhibition, uncontrollable laughter, changes in per\u00ad\nception, and achievement of a dream-like state. Mental concentra\u00ad\ntion may be difficult. Vasodilation occurs, and the pulse rate is \nincreased. Habitual users show a reddened conjunctiva. A with\u00ad\ndrawal state has been noted only in heavy users of marijuana. The \ndangers of marijuana use concern its impairment of judgment \nand reflexes, effects that arc potentiated by concomitant use of \nsedative-hypnotics , including ethanol. Legalization of marijuana \nuse in several states and perceived risk of automobile accidents has \nled to interest in the development of roadside tests of \"driving \nwhile high.\" Potential therapeutic effects of marijuana include its \nability to decrease intraocular pressure, its analgesic effect, and its CHAPTER 32 Drugs of Abuse 273 \nantiemetic actions (see Chapter 60). Dronabinol (a controlled\u00ad\nsubstance formulation of THC) and nabilone (a synthetic can\u00ad\nnabinoid similar to THC) are used to combat severe nausea and as \nadjuncts for chronic pain. Rimonabant, an inverse agonist at can\u00ad\nnabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), was approved fur use in the treat\u00ad\nment of obesity in Europe but has been withdrawn worldwide . \nINHALANTS \nCertain gases or volatile liquids are abused because they provide a \nfeeling of euphoria or disinhibition. \nA. Anesthetics \nThis group includes nitrous oxide, chloroform, and dicthylcther. \nSuch agents are hazardous because they affect judgment and \ninduce loss of consciousness. Inhalation of nitrous oxide as the \npure gas (with no oxygen) has caused asphyxia and death. Ether is \nhighly flammable. \nB. Industrial Solvents \nSolvents and a wide range of volatile compounds are present in \ncommercial products such as gasoline, paint thinners, aerosol pro\u00ad\npellants, glues, rubber cements, and shoe polish. Because of their \nready availability, these substances are most frequently abused by \nchildren in early adolescence. Active ingredients that have been \nidentified include benzene, hexane, methylethylketone, toluene, \nand trichloroethylene. Many of these are toxic to the liver, kid\u00ad\nneys, lungs, bone marrow, and peripheral nerves and have been \nshown to cause brain damage in animals. \nC. Organic Nitrites \nAmyl nitrite, isobutyl nitrite, and other organic nitrites are referred \nto as \"poppers\" and are mainly used as sexual intercourse enhanc\u00ad\ners. Inhalation of the nitrites causes dizziness, tachycardia, hypo\u00ad\ntcnsion, and flushing. With the exception of mcthemoglobinemia, \nfew serious adverse effects have been reponed. \nSTEROIDS \nIn many countries, including the United States, anabolic steroids \nare controlled substances based on their potential for abuse. Effects \nsought by abusers are increase in muscle mass and strength rather \nthan euphoria. However, excessive use can have adverse behav\u00ad\nioral, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal effects. Acne (sometimes \nsevere), premature closure of the epiphyses, and masculinization \nin females are anticipated androgenic adverse effects. Hepatic dys\u00ad\nfunction has been reported, and the anabolic steroids may pose an \nincreased risk of myocardial infarction. Behavioral manifestations \ninclude increases in libido and aggression (\"raid rage\"). A with\u00ad\ndrawal syndrome has been described with fatigue and depression \nof mood."

            "Text": "ANSWERS \n1. Therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines may lead to depen\u00ad\ndence with withdrawal symptoms including anxiety and agi\u00ad\ntation observable on abrupt discontinuance after a few weeks \nof treatment. Like most sedative-hypnotics, benzodiazepines \nare schedule-controlled, exhibiting dependence liability and \nthe development of tolerance. Additive depression occurs \nwith ethanol and many other CNS drugs. The answer is E. \n2. This patient is probably withdrawing from dependence on \nboth alprazolam and alcohol use. In addition to the symp\u00ad\ntoms described previously, abrupt withdrawal from sedative\u00ad\nhypnotic dependence may include hyperrefle:xia progressing \nto seizures, with ensuing coma and possibly death. The risk of \na seizure is increased if the patient abruptly withdraws from \nethanol use at the same time. Depending on severity of symp\u00ad\ntoms, initial management may require parenteral diazepam \nor lorazepam, with the latter drug often favored in hepatic \ndysfunction. The answer is D. \n3. Acamprosate is an antagonist ofNMDA glutamate receptors \nused together with counseling in alcohol treatment programs. \nVarenicline, a partial agonist at nicotinic receptors, blocks the \nrewarding effects of nicotine and is used in smoking cessation \nprograms. However, the drug may cause psychiatric changes \nand in overdose has caused seizures. The answer is E. \n4. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal usually begin within 6-8 h, \nand the acute course may last 6--8 d. However, a secondary \nphase of heroin withdrawal, characterized by bradycardia, hypo\u00ad\ntension, hypothermia, and mydriasis, may last 26-30 weeks. \nMethadone is commonly used in detoxification of the heroin \naddict because it is a strong agonist, has high oral bioavailability, \nand has a relatively long half-life. The answer is D. \n5. Overdoses with amphetamines or cocaine have many signs \nand symptoms in common. However, the ability of cocaine \nto block the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve \nterminals results in greater cardiotoxidty. Tachycardia is the \nrule, with the possibility of an arrhythmia, infarct, or stroke. \nThe answer is B. \n6. Psilocybin, mescaline, and LSD have similar central (via sero\u00ad\ntonergic systems) and peripheral (sympathomimetic) effects, \nbut no actions on dopaminergic receptors in the CNS. None \nof the hallucinogenic drugs have been shown to have terato\u00ad\ngenic potential. Unlike most hallucinogens, PCP (not LSD) \nacts as a positive reinforcer of self-administration in animals. \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: \nD Identify the major drugs that are commonly abused. CHAPTER 32 Drugs of Abuse 275 \nEmergence reactions can occur after use ofketamine, but they \nare not signs of withdrawal. Scopolamine blocks muscarinic \nreceptors. The answer is A. \n7. Male preteens are most likely to \"experiment\" with solvent \ninhalation. This can result in central and peripheral neurotox\u00ad\nicity, liver and kidney damage, and pulmonary disease. Opi\u00ad\noids, including fentanyl and meperidine, are the most widely \nabused by medical personnel working in hospitals. Industrial \nsolvents rarely cause methemoglobinemia, but this (and head\u00ad\naches, flushing, and hypotension) occur after excessive use of \nnitrites. The answer is E. \n8. Two of the most characteristic signs of marijuana use are \nincreased pulse rate and reddening of the conjunctiva. \nDecreases in blood pressure and in psychomotor performance \noccur. Pupil size is not changed by marijuana. The answer is B. \n9. The signs and symptoms point to PCP intoxication. The \npresence of both horizontal and vertical nystagmus is pathog\u00ad\nnomonic. The answer is E. \n10. Management of PCP overdose involves ventilatory support \nand control of seizures (with a benzodiazepine), hyperten\u00ad\nsion, and hyperthermia. Anti psychotic drugs ( eg, haloperidol} \nmay also be useful fur psychosis. None of the drugs listed are \nof value. Atropine may cause hyperthermia! PCP is a weak \nbase, and its renal elimination may be accelerated by urinary \nacidification, not alkalinization! A large percentage of PCP \nis secreted into the stomach, so removal of the drug may be \nhastened by activated charcoal or nasogastric suction. The \nanswer is E. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: DRUG OF ABUSE \nOVERDOSE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS \n(SEE CHAPTERS 22 AND 31) \nReadily detectable markers that may assist in diagnosis of \nthe cause of drug overdose toxicity include changes in heart \nrate, blood pressure, respiration , body temperature , sweating, \nbowel sounds, and pupillary responses. For example, tachy\u00ad\ncardia, hypertension , Increased body temperature, decreased \nbowel sounds, and mydriasis are common characteristics \nof overdose of CNS stimulants, including amphetamines , \ncocaine, and most hallucinogens. \nD Describe the signs and symptoms of overdose with, and withdrawal from, CNS stimu\u00ad\nlants, opioid analgesics, and sedative-hypnotics, including ethanol. \nD Describe the general principles of the management of overdose of commonly abused \ndrugs. \nD Identify the most likely causes of death from commonly abused drugs."

Iron and Vitamin Deficiency Anemias \nMicrocytic hypochromic anemia, caused by iron deficiency, is the \nmost common type of anemia. Megaloblastic anemias are a sub\u00ad\nset of the macrocytic anemias and are caused by a deficiency of \nvitamin B12 or folic acid, cofactors required for the normal matu\u00ad\nration of red blood cells. Pernicious anemia, the most common \ntype of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, is caused by a defect in \nthe synthesis of intrin.tic factor, a protein required for efficient \nabsorption of dietary vitamin Bl2> or by surgical removal of that \npart of the stomach that secretes intrinsic factor. \nB. Other Blood Cell Deficiencies \nDeficiency in the concentration of the various lineages of blood \ncells can be a manifestation of a disease or an adverse effect of \nradiation or cancer chemotherapy. Recombinant DNA-directed \nsynthesis of hematopoietic growth factors now makes possible the \ntreatment of more patients with deficiencies in erythrocytes, neu\u00ad\ntrophils, and platelets. Some of these growth factors also play an \nimportant role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \nC. Anemia caused by Erythrocyte Destruction \nSickle cell disease is a genetic cause of hemolytic anemia due to \nincreased erythrocyte destruction. Patients with sickle cell disease are homozygous for the aberrant ~hemoglobin S (HbS) allele. \nDeo:xygenated HhS chains form polymeric structures that dramat\u00ad\nically change erythrocyte shape (sickle), reduce deformability , and \nelicit membrane permeability changes that promote hemoglobin \npolymerization, eventually leading to veno-occlusive events caus\u00ad\ning pain and organ ischemia. \nVoxelotor is the first FDA-approved hemoglobin oxygen\u00ad\naffinity modulator. It is an oral drug that binds HbS and reduces \nsickling by increasing its affinity for oxygen; Voxdotor has been \nshown to have disease-modifying potential by increasing hemo\u00ad\nglobin levels and decreasing hemolysis indicators in sickle cell \npatients. Common side effects were headache, diarrhea, abdomi\u00ad\nnal pain, nausea, fatigue, rash, and fever. \nIRON \nA. Role of Iron \nIron is the essential metallic component of heme, the molecule \nresponsible for the bulk of oxygen transport in the blood. \nAlthough most of the iron in the body is contained in hemoglobin, \nan important fraction is hound to tramferrin; a transport protein, \nand ferritin; a storage protein. Deficiency of iron occurs most \noften in women because of menstrual blood loss and in vegetar\u00ad\nians or malnourished persons because of inadequate dietary iron \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Clinical Use \nPrevention or treatment of iron deficiency anemia is the only indi\u00ad\ncation for iron administration. Iron deficiency can be diagnosed \nfrom red blood cell changes (microcytic cell size due to dimin\u00ad\nished hemoglobin content) and from measurements of serum and \nbone marrow iron stores. The disease is treated by dietary ferrous \niron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconatc, \nor ferrous fumarat.e. In special cases, treatment is by parenteral \nadministration of a colloid containing a core of iron oxyhydroxide \nsurrounded by a shdl of carbohydrate. Parenteral iron prepara\u00ad\ntions include iron denran, sodium ferric gluconate compla, \nand iron sucrose. Iron should not be given in hemolytic anemia \nbecause iron stores are elevated, not depressed, in this type of ane\u00ad\nmia. Fenunoxytol is a super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanopar\u00ad\nticle coated with carbohydrate. Ferumoxytol may interfere with \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Thus, MRI should be \nperformed prior to ferumoxytol therapy. \nD. Toxicity of Iron (See Also Chapter 57) \n1. Signs and symptoms-Acute iron intoxication is most com\u00ad\nmon in children and usually occurs as a result of accidental inges\u00ad\ntion of iron supplementation tablets. Depending on the dose of \niron, necrotizing gastroenteritis, shock, metabolic acidosis, coma, \nand death may result. Chronic iron overload, known as hemo\u00b7 \nchromatosis, damages the organs that store excess iron (heart, \nliver, pancreas). Hemochromatosis occurs most often in individu\u00ad\nals with an inherited abnormality of iron absorption and those \nwho receive frequent transfusions for treatment of hemolytic dis\u00b7 \norders (eg, thalassemia major). \n2. Treatment of acute iron intoxication-Immediate treat\u00ad\nment is necessary and usually consists of removal of unabsorbed \ntablets from the gut, correction of acid-base and electrolyte abnor\u00ad\nmalities, and parenteral administration of deferoumine, which \nchdates circulating iron. Activated charcoal does not bind iron in \nthe gut and thus is ineffective. \n3. Treatment of chronic iron toxicity-Treatment of the \ngenetic form of hemochromatosis is usually by phlebotomy. \nHemochromatosis that is due to frequent transfusions is treated \nwith parenteral deferoxamine or with the newer oral iron chdator \ndcfetuiroL \nVITAMIN B,2 \nA. Role of Vitamin 112 \nVitamin Bu (cobalamin), a cobalt-containing molecule, is, along \nwith folic acid, a cofactor in the transfer of I-carbon units, a step \nnecessary for the synthesis of DNA Impairment of DNA synthe\u00b7 \nsis affects all cells, but because red blood cells must be produced \ncontinuously, deficiency of either vitamin Bu or folic acid usu\u00ad\nally manifests first as anemia. In addition, vitamin Bu deficiency \ncan cause neurologi c defects, which may become irreversible if not \ntreated promptly . B. Pharmacokinetics \nVitamin B12 is produced only by bacteria; this vitamin cannot be \nsynthesized by multicellular organisms. It is found in many foods \nand absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of \nintrinsic &ctor, a product of the parietal cells of the stomach. \nPlasma transpon is accomplished by binding to transcobalamin \nIL Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver in large amounts; a normal \nindividual has enough to last 5 years. The two available forms of \nvitamin Bu, cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin, have similar \npharmacokinetics, but hydroxocobalamin has a longer circulating \nhalf-life. \nC. Pharmacodynamlcs \nVitamin B12 is essential in two reactions: conversion of methyl\u00ad\nmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA and conversion of \nhomocysteine to methionine. The second reaction is linked to \nfolic acid metabolism and synthesis of deoxythymidylate (dTMP; \nFigure 33-2, section 2), a precursor required for DNA synthesis. \nIn vitamin B12 deficiency, folates accumulate as N5 \u00b7methyltetra\u00b7 \nhydrofolate; the supply of tetrahydrofolate is depleted; and the \nproduction of red blood cells slows. Administration of folic acid to \npatients with vitamin B12 deficiency helps refill the tetrahydrofo\u00b7 \nlate pool (Figure 33-2, section 3) and partially or fully corrects the \nanemia. However, the exogenous folic acid does not correct the \nneurologic defects of vitamin B12 deficiency. \nD. Clinical Use and Toxicity \nThe two available forms of vitamin B12-hydroxocobalamin and \ncyanocobalamin-have equivalent effects. The major application \nis in the treatment of naturally occurring pernicious anemia and \nanemia caused by gastric resection. Because vitamin B12 deficiency \nanemia is almost always caused by inadequate absorption, therapy \nshould be by replacement of vitamin B12, using parenteral therapy. \nNeither form of vitamin Bu has significant toxicity. \nFOLICACID \nA. Role of Folic Acid \nLike vitamin Bw folic acid is required for normal DNA synthe. \nsis, and its deficiency usually presents as megaloblastic anemia. In \naddition, deficiency of folk acid during pregnancy increases the \nrisk of neural tube defects in the fetus. \nB. Pharmacokinetics \nFolic acid is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Only \nmodest amounts are stored in the body; so a decrease in dietary \nintake is followed by anemia within a few months. \nC. Pharmacodynamics \nFolk acid is convened to tetrahydrofolate by the action of dihy\u00ad\ndrofolate reductase (Figure 33-2, section 3). One imponant set \nof reactions involving tetrahydrofolate and dihydrofolate consti\u00b7 \ntutes the dTMP cycle (Figure 33-2, section 2), which supplies \nthe dTMP required for DNA synthesis.

Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out \nbefore one selects folic acid as the sole therapeutic agent in the \ntreatment of a patient with megaloblastic anemia. Felic acid has \nno recognized toxicity. \nHEMATOPOIETIC GROWTH FACTORS \nMore than a dozen glycoprotein hormones that regulate the dif\u00ad\nferentiation and maturation of stem cells within the bone marrow \nhave been identified.

Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin \nbeta is a long-lasting form of erythropoietin that can be adminis\u00ad\ntered once or twice a month. \nThe most common complications of ESA therapy are hyper\u00ad\ntension and thrombosis. The serum hemoglobin concentration of \npatients treated with an ESA should not exceed 12 g/dL because \nhemoglobin concentrations above this target have been linked to \nan increased rate of mortality and cardiovascular events. \nB. Myeloid Growth Factors \nFilgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) and \nsargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating fac\u00ad\ntor; GM-CSF) stimulate the production and function of neutro\u00ad\nphils.

When given to patients soon after autologous stem \ncell transplantation, G-CSF reduces the time to engraftment and \nthe duration of neutropenia. In patients with multiple myeloma \nor non-Hodgkin lymphoma who respond poorly to G-CSF alone, \nG-CSF may be combined with the novel hematopoietic stem cell \nmobilizer plerinfor, an inhibitor of the CXC chemokine recep\u00ad\ntor 4 (CXCR4).

Megakaryocyte Growth Factors \nOprelvekin (interleukin-11 [IIAl]) stimulates the growth of \nprimitive megakaryocytic progenitors and increases the number \nof peripheral platelets. IL-11 is used for the treatment of patients \nwho have had a prior episode of thrombocytopenia after a cycle \nof cancer chemotherapy. In such patients, it reduces the need for \nplatelet transfusions. The most common adverse effects of IL-11 \nare fatigue, headache, dizziness, and fluid retention. \nRomiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist with a \nnovel peptide structure, is used subcutaneously in patients with \nchronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia who have failed to respond \nto conventional treatment . Eltrombopag is an oral agonist of the \nthrombopoietin receptor that is also used for patients with chronic \nidiopathic thrombocytopenia that is refractory to other agents. \nThe risk of hepatotoxicity and hemorrhage has restricted eltrom\u00ad\nbopag use to registered physicians and patients.

Dan\u00ad\ntrolene inhibits Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum \nand is an antidote fur malignant hyperthermia induced by \ninhaled anesthetics. The answer is C. \n5. Resection of the stomach does lead to loss of intrinsic factor \nand the patient will be deficient in vitamin B12\u2022 Prevention \nor treatment of iron deficiency anemia (microcytic cell size) \nis the only indication for iron administration. Sargramostim \nis a GM-CSF and is used to stimulate the production of neu\u00ad\ntrophils and other myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitors. \nThe answer is B. \n6. The kidney produces erythropoietin; patients with chronic \nrenal insufficiency often require exogenous erythropoietin to \navoid chronic anemia. The answer is C. \n7. Filgrastim (G-CSF) stimulates the production and function \nof neutrophils, important cellular mediators of the innate \nimmune system that serve as the first line of defense against \ninfection. The answer is E. \n8. Deficiency of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) leads to a deficiency \nin tetrahydrofolate and subsequently a deficiency of the \ndTMP required for DNA synthesis. Homocysteine and \nN-methyltetrahydrofolate accumulate. The answer is B. \n9. Oprelve.kin (IL-11) stimulates platelet production and \ndecreases the number of platelet transfusions required by \npatients undergoing bone marrow suppression therapy for \ncancer. The answer is D. \n10. The success of transplantation with peripheral blood stem \ncells depends on infusion of adequate numbers of hemato\u00ad\npoietic stem cells. Administration of G-CSF to the donor (in \nthe case of autologous transplantation, the patient who also \nwill be the recipient of the transplantation) greatly increases \nthe number of hematopoietic stem cdls harvested from the \ndonor's blood. The answer is B. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: ROUTES OF \nADMINISTRATION (SEE CHAPTER 1) \nAll of the hematopoietic growth factors are proteins with \nmolecular weights greater than 15,000. Uke other protein\u00ad\naceous drugs, the growth factors cannot be administered \norally because they have very poor bioavailability. Their \npeptide bonds are destroyed by stomach acid and digestive \nenzymes. \nInjections are required for intravenous, intramuscular, \nand subcutaneous administration. The intravenous route \noffers the fastest onset of drug action and shortest dura-\ntion of drug action. Because intravenous administration \ncan produce high blood /~Is, this route of administration \nhas the greatest risk of producing concentration-dependent \ndrug toxicity. Intramuscular injection hos a quicker onset of \naction than subcutaneous injection, and larger volumes of \ninjected fluid con be given. Because protective barriers con be \nbreached by the needle or tubing used for drug injection, a/13 \nof these routes of administration carry a greater risk of infec\u00ad\ntion than does oral drug administration."

Clinical use-Because of its rapid effect, heparin is used when \nanticoagulation is needed immediatdy (eg, when starting therapy). \nCommon uses include treatment ofDVf, pulmonary embolism, and \nacute myocardial infuction. Heparin is used in combination with \nthrombolytics for revasculari7.ation and in combination with glyco\u00ad\nprotein Ilb/Illa inhibitors during angioplasty and placement of coro\u00ad\nnary stents.

Toxlclty&reversa/-Increased bleeding is the most common \nadverse effect of heparin and related molecules; the bleeding may \nresult in hemorrhagic stroke. Protamine can lessen the risk of seri\u00ad\nous bleeding that can result from excessive unfractionated heparin. Protamine only partially reverses the effects of LMW heparins and \ndoes not affect the action of fondaparinux.

Like unfraction\u00ad\natcd heparin, the action of these drugs can be monitored with the \naPTI laboratory test. Advantages of oral direct thrombin inhibi\u00ad\ntors include predictable pharmacokinetics, which allows fur fixed \ndosing, as well as a predictable immediate anticoagulant response \nthat makes routine monitoring or overlap with other anticoagu\u00ad\nlants unnecessary. In addition, these agents do not interact with \nP450-interacting drugs. Dabigatran (by mouth) is approved for \nmost indications of oral anticoagulation, including prevention of \nstroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, pro\u00ad\nphylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following hip or knee \nreplacement surgery and reduction of the risk of recurrent VfE. \n4. Toxicity & reversal-Like other anticoagulants, the direct \nthrombin inhibitors can cause bleeding. ldarucizumab is a \nhumanized monoclonal antibody Fab fragment that binds to dabi\u00ad\ngatran and reverses the anticoagulant effect. \nD. Direct Oral Factor xa inhibitors \n7. Chemistry and pharmacokinetics-Oral Xa inhibitors, \nincluding the small molecules rivaroxaban, apinban, edouban, \nand betrixaban have a rapid onset of action and shorter half-llves \nthan warf.uin. These drugs are given as fixed oral doses and do not \nrequire monitoring. They undergo cytochrome P450-dependent \nand cytochrome P450-independent elimination. \n2. Mechanism and effects-These small molecules directly \nbind to and inhibit both free factor Xa and factor Xa bound in the \nclotting complex. \n3. Clinical use-Rivaroxaban is approved fur prevention and \ntreatment of venous thromboembolism following hip or knee sur\u00ad\ngery and for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, \nwithout valvular heart disease. Apixaban is approved for prevention \nof embollc stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. \n4. Toxicity & reversal-Like other anticoagulants, the factor \nXa inhibitors can cause bleeding. Andeo.net alfa is a modified \nrecombinant inactive form of human factor Xa developed for \nreversal of factor Xa inhibitors. \nE. Warfarin and Other Coumarin Anticoagulants \n7. Chemistry and pharmacokinetics-Warfarin and other \ncoumarin anticoagulants are small, lipid-soluble molecules that \nare readily absorbed after oral administration. Warfarin is highly \nbound to plasma proteins (>99%), and its elimination depends on \nmetabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n2. Mechanism and elfects-Warf.uin and other coumarins \ninterfere with the normal post-translational modification of clot\u00ad\nting factors in the liver, a process that depends on an adequate sup\u00ad\nply of reduced vitamin K. The drugs inhibit vitamin K epoxide \nreductase (VK.OR), which normally converts vitamin K epoxide to CHAPTER 34 Drugs Used in Coagulation Disorders 289 \nreduced vitamin K. The vitamin K-dependent factors include \nthrombin and factors VII, IX, X, and the anticoagulants, protein C \nand protein S. {Figure 34-1). Because the clotting factors have half\u00ad\nlives of 8-60 h in the plasma, an anticoagulant effect is observed \nonly after sufficient time has passed fur elimination of the normal \npreformed factors. The action of warf.uin can be reversed with vita\u00ad\nmin K, but recovery requires the synthesis of new normal clotting \nfactors and is, therefore, slow (6-24 h). More rapid reversal can be \nachieved by transfusion with fresh or frozen plasma that contains \nnormal clotting factors or prothrombin complex concentrate \n(PCC), which contains the vitamin K-dependent factors only. The \neffect of warf.uin is monitored by the prothrombin time (Pl) test. \nSKILL KEEPER: TREATMENT OF ATRIAL \nFIBRILLATION (SEE CHAPTERS 13 AND 14) \nPatients with chronic atrial fibrillation routinely receive war\u00ad\nfarin to prevent the formation of blood clots in the poorly \ncontracting atrium and to decrease the risk of embolism of \nsuch clots to the brain or other tissues. Such patients are also \noften treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. The primary goals of \nant/arrhythmic treatment are to slow the atrial rate and, most \nimportantly, control the ventricular rate. \n1. Which ant/arrhythmic drugs are most appropriate for \ntreating chronic atrial fibrillation? \n2. Do any of these drugs hove significant Interactions with \nworforin? \n3. Con you name two alternative oral anticoagulants for \npatients with chronic atrial fibrillation? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \n3. Clinical use-Warf.uin is used for chronic anticoagulation \nin all of the clinical situations described previously for heparin, \nexcept in pregnant women. \n4. Toxicity-Bleeding is the most important adverse effect of \nwarf.uin. Early in therapy, a period of hypercoagulability with \nsubsequent dermal vascular necrosis can occur. This is due to defi\u00ad\nciency of protein C, an endogenous vitamin K-dependent antico\u00ad\nagulant with a short half-life. Warf.uin can cause bone defects and \nhemorrhage in the developing fetus and, therefore, is contraindi\u00ad\ncated in pregnancy. \nBecause warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, its involve\u00ad\nment in drug interactions is of major concern. Cytochrome \nP450-inducing drugs (cg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, \nbarbiturates) increase warf.uin' s clearance and reduce the antico\u00ad\nagulant effect of a given dose. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (cg, \namiodarone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cimetidine) \nreduce warfarin' s clearance and increase the anticoagulant effect \nof a given dose. Genetic variability in cytochrome P450 2C9 and \nVKOR affect responses to warfarin. Algorithms to determine ini\u00ad\ntial warfarin dose based on cytochrome P450 2C9 and VKOR, \nage, body size, and concomitant medications are being tested."

Direct Oral Anticoagulants versus Warfarin \nThe direct oral anticoagulants (clabigatran, rivaroxaban) have \nconsistently shown equivalent antithrombotic efficacy and lower \nbleeding rates when compared with warfarin. Other advantages \nare the lack of need for monitoring and fewer drug interactions \ncompared with warfarin.

The thrombolytic \nenzymes catalyze the conversion of the inactive precursor, plas\u00ad\nminogen, to plasmin. \n1. Tiuue plosminogen octivotor-t-PA is an enzyme that \ndirectly converts plasminogen to plasmin (Figure 34-2). It has little activity unless it is bound to fibrin, which, in theory, should make \nit sdective for the plasminogen that has already bound to fibrin (ie, \nin a clot) and should result in less danger of widespread produc\u00ad\ntion of plasmin and spontaneous bleeding. At the pharmacologic \nlevels oft-PA used in thrombolytic therapy, clot specificity is lost. \nAlteplase is recombinant human plasminogen activator. Reteplase \nis a mutated form of human t-PA with similar effects but a slightly \nfaster onset of action and longer duration of action. Tenecteplase \nis another mutated form oft-PA with a longer half-life. \n2. Streptolrinase-Streptokinase is obtained from bacterial \ncultures. Although not itself an enzyme, streptokinase forms a \ncomplex with endogenous plasminogen; the plasminogen in this \ncomplex undergoes a conformational change that allows it to rap\u00ad\nidly conven free plasminogen into plasmin. Unlike the forms of \nt-PA, streptokinase does not show selectivity fur fibrin-bound \nplasminogen. Urokinue is a human enzyme synthesized by the \nkidney that directly converts plasminogen to active plasmin. \nC. Clinical Use \nThe major application of the thrombolytic agents is as an alterna\u00ad\ntive to percutaneous coronary angioplasty in the emergency treat\u00ad\nment of coronary artery thrombosis. Under ideal conditions (ie, \ntreatment within 6 h), these agents can promptly recanalize the \noccluded coronary vessd. Very prompt use (ie, within 3-4.5 h of \nthe flrst symptoms) oft-PA in patients with ischemic stroke is \nassociated with a significantly better clinical outcome. Cerebral \nhemorrhage must be positivdy ruled out before such use.

            "Text": "thrombolytic agents are also used in cases of severe pulmonary \nembolism. \nD.Toxicity \nBleeding is the most important hazard and has about the same \nfrequency with all the thrombolytic drugs. Cerebral hemorrhage \nis the most serious manifestation. Streptokinase, a bacterial pro\u00ad\ntein, can evoke the production of antibodies that cause it to lose \nits effectiveness or induce severe allergic reactions on subsequent \ntherapy. Patients who have had streptococcal infections may have \npreformed antibodies to the drug. Because they are human pro\u00ad\nteins, the recombinant forms oft-PA are not subject to this prob\u00ad\nlem. However, they are much more expensive than streptokinase \nand not much more effective. \nANTI PLATELET DRUGS \nPlatelet aggregation contributes to the clotting process (Figure 34-3) \nand is especially important in clots that form in the arterial circula\u00ad\ntion. Platdets play a central role in pathologic coronary and cere\u00ad\nbral artery occlusion. Platdet aggregation is triggered by a variety of \nendogenous mediators that include the prostaglandin thromboxane, \nadenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, and fibrin. Substances \nWall defect CHAPTER 34 Drugs Used in Coagulation Disorders 291 \nthat increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP; \neg, the prostaglandin prostacydin, adenosine) inhibit platelet \naggregation. \nA. Classification and Prototypes \nAntiplatelet drugs include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti\u00ad\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glycoprotein lib/Illa receptor \ninhibitors (abchi.mab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide), antagonists of \nADP receptors (clopidogrd, prasugrd, and ticlopidine), antago\u00ad\nnists of the protease-activated receptor-I (PAR-I) (vorapuar), and \ninhibitors of phosphodiesterase 3 (dipyriclamole and ciloatuol). \nB. Mechanism of Action \nAspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit thromboxane synthesis by \nblocking the enzyme cydooxygenase (COX; see Chapter 18). \nThromboxane A2 is a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation. \nAspirin, an irreversible COX inhibitor, is particularly effective. \nBecause platelets lack the machinery for protein synthesis, inhi\u00ad\nbition by aspirin persists for several days until new platelets are \nformed. Other NSAIDs, which cause a less persistent antiplatelet \neffect (hours), are not used as antiplatelet drugs and, in fact, can \ninterfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin when used in com\u00ad\nbination with aspirin. \nClCJCJ c~Jf ~!\"mF~9 ~I\\-~\" \ncilostazol Degranulation \nADP .... :t \nTXA2;-:\u00b7~: \n/ \nPlatelets \n\"\"' TXA2+-AA \n: :p llW \u00a3Q\\.---__, \nIlla I Aspirin J \n~ Fibrinogen \nGPllb/ \nIlla \nGPllb/ \nIlla -Abciximab, \naptifibatide, \ntirofiban \nClopidogrel, \nticlopidine GPllb/ \nIlla Adenosine \nDipyridamole, \ncilostazol \nFIGURE 34-3 Thrombus formation at the site of the damaged vascular wall (EC, endothelial cell) and the role of platelets and clotting fac\u00ad\ntors.

Eptifibatide and tirofiban also reversibly block the glyco\u00ad\nprotcin IIb/Illa receptor. \nClopidogrd, prasugrd. and the older drug ticlopidine arc \nconverted in the liver to active metabolites that irreversibly inhibit \nthe platelet ADP receptor and thereby prevent ADP-mediated \nplatelet aggregation. Ticagrdor is a newer drug that docs not \nrequire activation and reversibly inhibits the platelet ADP recep\u00ad\ntor. Vorapaxar is a reversible antagonist of the protease-activated \nreceptor-I (PAR-1) expressed on platelets. Its long half-life makes \nit effectively irreversible; it inhibits thrombin-induced and throm\u00ad\nbin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induccd platelet aggregation \nin in vitro studies. It is metabolized via CYP3A4 and CYP2J2. \nDipyridamole and cilostazol appear to have a dual mechanism of \naction. They prolong the platelet-inhibiting action of intracellular \ncAMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes that degrade cyclic \nnucleotides, including cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation , \nand cyclic guanosinc monophosphate (cGMP), a vasodilator (sec \nChapters 12 and 19). They also inhibit the uptake of adcnosinc by \nendothelial cells and erythrocytes and thereby increase the plasma \nconcentration of adcnosinc. Adcnosinc acts through platelet adcnos\u00ad\ninc A2 receptors to increase platelet cAMP and inhibit aggregation. \nC. Cllnlcal Us\u2022 \nAspirin is used to prevent further infarcts in persons who have \nhad 1 or more myocardial infarcts. The drug is used extensively \nto prevent transient ischcmic attacks (TIAs), ischcmic stroke, and \nother thrombotic events. \nThe glycoprotein Ilb/Illa inhibitors prevent restenosis after \ncoronary angioplasty and arc used for short periods in acute coro\u00ad\nnary syndromes (cg, unstable angina and non..Q_..wavc acute myo-\u00ad\ncardial infarction). \nClopidogrel and ticlopidinc arc effective in preventing TIAs and \nischcmic strokes, especially in patients who cannot tolerate aspirin. \nOopidogrel is routinely used for 6-12 months with aspirin top~ \nvent thrombosis in patients after placement of a coronary artery stcnt. \nDipyridarnolc is approved as an adjunct to warfarin in the \nprevention of thrombosis in those with cardiac valve replacement \nand has been used in combination with aspirin for secondary pre\u00ad\nvention of ischcmic suoke. Cilostazol is used to treat intermittent \nclaudication, a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease. \nD.Toxiclty \nAspirin and other NSAIDs cause gastrointestinal and CNS effects \n(see Chapter 36). All antiplatelet drugs significantly enhance the \neffects of other anticlotting agents. The major toxicities of the gly\u00ad\ncoprotcin Ilb/IIIa receptor-blocking drugs arc bleeding and, with \nchronic use, thrombocytopenia. Ticlopidine is used rarely because \nit causes bleeding in up to 5% of patients, severe ncutropcnia in about 1 %, and very rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic \npwpura ('ITP), a syndrome characterized by the disseminated \nformation of small thrombi, platelet consumption, and throm\u00ad\nbocytopenia. Clopidogrel is less hcmatotoxic . The most common \nadverse effects of dipyridamolc and cilostazol arc headaches and \npalpitations . Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with conges\u00ad\ntive hcan failwe because of evidence of reduced survival. \nDRUGS USED IN BLEEDING DISORDERS \nInadequate blood clotting can result from vitamin K deficiency, \ngenetically determined errors of clotting factor synthesis {eg, \nhemophilia), a variety of drug-induced conditions, and thrombo\u00ad\ncytopenia. Treatment involves administration of vitamin K, pre\u00ad\nformed clotting factors, or antiplasmin drugs. Thrombocytopenia \ncan be treated by administration of platelets or oprdvekin, the \nrecombinant form of the megakaryocyte growth factor intcrleu\u00ad\nkin-11 (sec Chapter 33). \nA.VltamlnK \nDeficiency of vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is most common \nin older persons with abnormalities of fat absorption and in new\u00ad\nborns, who are at risk of bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency. The \ndeficiency is readily treated with oral or parenteral pbytonadione \n(vitamin K1). In the United States, all newborns receive an injec\u00ad\ntion of phytonadione. Large doses of vitamin K1 are used to reverse \nthe anticoagulant effect of excess warfarin. \nB. Clotting Factors and Desmopressin \nThe most important agents used to treat hemophilia are fresh \nplasma and purified human blood clotting factors, especially fac\u00ad\ntor VIII (for hemophilia A) and factor IX (fur hemophilia B), \nwhich are either purified from blood products or produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology. These products arc expensive and \ncarry a risk of immunologic reactions and, in the case of factors \npurified from blood products, infection (although most known \nblood-borne pathogens are removed by chemical treatment of the \nplasma extracts). \nThe vasopressin V2 receptor agonist desmoprasin ac.etate (see \nChapter 37) increases the plasma concentration of von Willebrand \nfactor and factor VIII. It is used to prepare patients with mild \nhemophilia A or von Willebrand disease for elective surgery. \nC. Antiplasmin Agents \nAntiplasmin agents are valuable for the prevention or management \nof acute bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia and others \nwith a high risk of bleeding disorders. Aminocaproic acid and \ntranaamic acid are orally active agents that inhibit .fibrinolysis by \ninhibiting plasminogen activation (Figure 34-2). Adverse effects \ninclude thrombosis, hypotcnsion, myopathy, and diarrhea. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The patient is most likely to be \ntreated with which of the following? \n(A} Abciximab \n(B} Bivalirudin \n(C} Tirofiban \n(D) Plasminogen \n(E) Vitamin K1 ANSWERS \n1. Reteplase is the only thrombolytic drug listed. Heparin and \nwarfarin are anticoagulants. Argatroban is a direct inhibi\u00ad\ntor of thrombin, and aminocaproic acid is an inhibitor, not \nan activator, of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. \nThe answer is D. \n2. The most common serious adverse effect of the flbrinolytics is \nbleeding, especially in the cerebral circulation . The flbrinolyt\u00ad\nics do not usually have serious effects on the renal, hepatic, \nor hematologic systems. Unlike heparin, they do not induce \nantiplatelet antibodies. The answer is D. \n3. Clopidogrd is a prodrug that is activated by CYP2C9 and \nCYP2C19 . It irreversibly binds to the ADP receptor on the \nsurface of platelets that plays a key role in platelet aggregation. \nAspirin and clopidogrel help prevent platelet-induced occlu\u00ad\nsion of coronary stents. The answer is D. \n4. A drug that increases metabolism (clearance) of the antico\u00ad\nagulant lowers the steady-state plasma concentration (both \nfree and bound forms), whereas one that displaces the antico\u00ad\nagulant increases the plasma level of the free form only until \nelimination of the drug has again lowered it to the steady\u00ad\nstate level. The answer is C. \nS. Abciximab is an antiplatelet agent that binds to and inhib\u00ad\nits GPIIb/Illa. Rivaroxaban is an oral factor X inhibitor and \nwarfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). \nThe answer is B. \n6. Due to the shorter half-life of the oral factor X and thrombin \ninhibitors, the anticoagulant status of the patient changes rap\u00ad\nidly. Sudden cessation of short-acting oral anticoagulants can \nlead to stroke. Excess bleeding is associated with taking any \nof the anticoagulants not with stopping them. An increase in \nINR reflects increased anticoagulation by warfarin. Thrombo\u00ad\ncytopenia is a risk associated with heparin. The answer is D. \n7. INR (measured as PT test) reflects changes due to warfarin \nand to some extent the thrombin inhibitors. Factor X inhibi\u00ad\ntion is not reliably measured by the aPTT (used for unfrac\u00ad\ntionated heparin) or PT test. The answer is B. \n8. Enoxaparin is an LMW heparin. LMW heparins have a longer \nhalf-life than standard heparin and a more consistent relation\u00ad\nship between dose and therapeutic effect. Enoxaparin is given \nsubcutaneously, not intravenously. It is less, not more, likely \nto cause thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Neither LMW \nheparins nor standard heparin are teratogenic. The aPTT \nis not useful for monitoring the effects of LMW heparins. \nThe answer is A. \n9. The elevated INR indicates excessive anticoagulation with a \nhigh risk of hemorrhage. Warfarin should be discontinued \nand vitamin K1 administered to accelerate formation of vita\u00ad\nmin K-dependent factors. The answer is E. \n10. Direct thrombin inhibitors such as bivalirudin and argatroban \nprovide parenteral anticoagulation similar to that achieved \nwith heparin, but the direct thrombin inhibitors do not \ninduce formation of antiplatelet antibodies. The answer is B. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Drugs discussed in this chapter \nprevent the sequelae of atherosclerosis (heart attacks, angina, \nperipheral arterial disease, ischemic stroke) and decrease C H A P T E R \nmortality in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease and \nhyperlipidemia. Although the drugs are generally safe and effec\u00ad\ntive, they can cause problems, including drug-drug interactions \nand toxic reactions in skeletal muscle and the liver. \nLipid-lowering drugs \nHMG-CoA \nreductase \nInhibitors \n(lovastatin) I \n~esns \nHYPERLIPOPROTEI N EMIA \nA. Pathogenesis J I Ezetimibe \nPremature or accelerated development of atherosclerosis is strongly \nassociated with elevated concentrations of certain plasma lipo\u00ad\nproteins, especially the low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) that par\u00ad\nticipate in cholesterol transport. A depressed level of high-density \nlipoproteins (HDLs) is also associated with increased risk of ath\u00ad\nerosclerosis. In some families, hypertriglyceridemia is similarly cor\u00ad\nrelated with atherosclerosis . Chylomicronemia, the occurrence of \nchylomicrons in the serum while fasting, is a recessive trait that is \ncorrelated with a high incidence of acute pancreatitis and managed \nby restriction of total fat intake (Table 35-1). \nRegulation of plasma lipoprotein levels involves a complex: \ninterplay of dietary fat intake, hepatic processing, and utilization \nin peripheral tissues (Figure 35-1). Primary disturbances in regula\u00ad\ntion occur in a number of genetic conditions involving mutations \nin apolipoproteins, their receptors, transport mechanisms, and \nlipid-metabolizing enzymes. Secondary disturbances are associated \n298 J \n~iacln I [!ibrates \n(gemfibrozil) _I ---, \nPCSK9 Inhibitors I \n(alirocumab , \nevocumab) \nwith a Western diet, many endocrine conditions, and diseases of \nthe liver or kidneys. \nB. Treatment Strategies \n1. Diet-Cholesterol and saturated fats are the primary dietary fac\u00ad\ntors that contribute to elevated levels of plasma lipoproteins. Dietary \nmeasures designed to reduce the total intake of these substances \nconstitute the first method of management and may be sufficient \nto reduce lipoprotein levels to a safe range. Because alcohol raises \ntriglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, it \nshould be avoided by patients with hyperuiglyceridemia. \n2. Drugs-For an individual patient, the choice of drug treatment \nis based on the lipid abnormality. The drugs that are most effec\u00ad\ntive at lowering LD L cholesterol include the HM G-CoA reductase \ninhibitors, resins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and niacin. The \nfl.bric acid derivatives, niacin, and marine omega-3 fatty acids are \nmost effective at lowering triglyceride and VLDL concentrations \nand raising HDL cholesterol concentrations (Table 35-2). \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Phlladelphla, PA: Butterworth-Heinemann; 1997.) \nHMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS \nA. Mechanism and Effects \nThe rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol synthe&is is conversion \nof hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG.CaA) to mevalon\u00ad\natc by HMG\u00b7CoA reductase. The stathu are structural analogs of \nHMG-CoA that competitively inhibit the enzyme (Figure 35-2). \nLovastatin and simvastatin are prod.rugs, whereas the other HMG\u00ad\nCoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, \npitavastatin, and rosuvastatin) are active as given. \nAlthough the inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis con\u00ad\ntributes a small amount to the total serum chole&terol\u00b7lowcring \neffect of these drugs, a much greater effect derives from the \nresponse to a reduction in a tightly regulated hepatic pool of cho\u00ad\nle&terol. The liver compensates by increasing the number of high\u00b7 \naffinity LDL receptora, which clear LDL and VLDL remnants \nfrom the blood (Figures 35-1 and 35-2). Note that functional \nLDL receptors arc required to achieve a therapeutic LDI.....lowcring cffcct with rcductasc inhibitors. HMG-CoA rcductasc inhibitors \nalso have direct antiatherosclerotic effects and anti\u00b7inflammatory \neffecu and have been shown to prevent bone le&s. \nB. Clinical Use \nStatins can reduce LDL cholesterol levels dramatically (fable 35-2), \nespecially when used in combination with other cholesterol\u00b7lowering \ndrug (fable 35-1). These drugs are used commonly because they are \ncffi:ctivc and well mlcrat:cd. Large clinical trials have shown that they \nreduce the risk of coronary events and mon:ality in patients with isch\u00b7 \ncmic heart disease, and they also reduce the risk of ischcmic stroke. \nRomvutat:in and atonastatin are high\u00b7intensity statins that \nreduce LDlrC by 50%; pitaftatatin and limvutatia are mod\u00b7 \ncrate-intensity statins (30-50% LDlrC reduction); and the other \nstatins are low\u00b7intensity swins (<30% LDL reduction). The \nhigh-intensity statins also reduce triglyceride& and increase HDL \ncholesterol in patients with triglyceride levels that are higher than \n250 mg/dL and with reduced HDL cholaterol levels. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

In some patients with a genetic condition that predisposes \nthem to hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (familial \ncombined hyperlipidemia), resins increase triglycerides and VLDL. \nB. Clinical Use \nThe resins are used in patients with hypercholesterolemia \n(Table 35-1). They have also been used to reduce pruritus in \npatients with cholestasis and bile salt accumulation. \nC. Toxicity \nAdverse effects from resins include bloating, constipation, and \nan unpleasant gritty taste. Absorption of vitamins (cg, vitamin K, \ndietary folates) and drugs (eg, thiazide diuretics, warfarin, pravas\u00ad\ntatin, fluvastatin) is impaired by the resins. \nEZETIMIBE \nA. Mechanism and Effects \nEzetimibe is a prodrug that is converted in the liver to the active \nglucuronide form. This active metabolite inhibits a transporter that \nmediates gastrointestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols \n(plant sterols that normally enter gastrointestinal epithelial cdls but \nthen are immediately transported back into the intestinal lumen). \nBy preventing absorption of dietary cholesterol and cholesterol \nthat is excreted in bile, ezetimibe reduces the cholesterol in the \ntightly regulated hepatic pool. A compensatory increase in the \nsynthesis of high-afHnity LDL receptors increases the removal of \nLDL lipoproteins from the blood. \n& monotherapy, ezetimibe reduces LDL cholesterol by about \n20% (Table 35-2). When combined with an HMG-CoA reduc\u00ad\ntase inhibitor, it is even more effective. \nB. Clinical Use \nEzetimibe is used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and phy\u00ad\ntosterolemia, a rare genetic disorder that results from impaired \nexport of phytosterols. \nC. Toxicity \nEzetimibe is well tolerated. When combined with HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors, it may increase the risk of hepatic toxicity. \nSerum concentrations of the glucuronide form are increased by \nflbrates and reduced by cholestyramine. \nNIACIN (NICOTINIC ACID) \nA. Mechanism and Effects \nThrough multiple actions, niacin (but not nicotinamide) reduces \nLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDL and also often increases HDL cholesterol. In the liver, niacin reduces VLDL synthesis, \nwhich in turn reduces LDL levels (Figures 35-1 and 35-2). In \nadipose tissue, niacin appears to activate a signaling pathway \nthat reduces hormone-sensitive lipase activity and thus decreases \nplasma fatty acid and triglyceride levels. Consequently, LDL for\u00ad\nmation is reduced, and there is a decrease in LDL cholesterol. \nIncreased clearance of VLDL by the lipoprotein lipase associated \nwith capillary endothelial cells has also been demonstrated and \nprobably accounts for the reduction in plasma triglyceride concen\u00ad\ntrations. Niacin reduces the catabolic rate for HDL. Finally, niacin \ndecreases circulating fibrinogen and increases tissue plasminogen \nactivator. \nB. Clinical Use \nBecause it lowers serum LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concen\u00ad\ntrations and increases HDL cholesterol concentrations, niacin has \nwide clinical usefulness in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, \nhypertriglyceridemia, and low levels ofHDL cholesterol. \nC. Toxicity \nCutaneous flushing is a common adverse effect of niacin. Pretreat\u00ad\nment with aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) reduces the intensity of this flushing, suggesting that \nit is mediated by prostaglandin release. Tolerance to the flush\u00ad\ning reaction usually develops within a few days. Dose-dependent \nnausea and abdominal discomfort often occur. Pruritus and other \nskin conditions are reported. Moderate elevations of liver enzymes \nand even severe hepatotoxicity may occur. Severe liver dysfunction \nhas been associated with an extended-release preparation, which is \nnot the same as the sustained-release formulation. Hyperuricemia \noccurs in about 20% of patients, and carbohydrate tolerance may \nbe moderately impaired. \nFIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES \nA. Mechanism and Effects \nFibric acid derivatives (cg, gemflbrozil, fcnofibrate} arc ligands \nfor the pcroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-a:) \nprotein, a receptor that regulates transcription of genes involved \nin lipid metabolism. This interaction with PPAR-a results in \nincreased synthesis by adipose tissue of lipoprotein lipase, which \nassociates with capillary endothelial cells and enhances clearance \nof triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Figure 3 5-1). In the liver, fibrates \nstimulate fatty acid oxidation, which limits the supply of triglycer\u00ad\nides and decreases VLDL synthesis. They also decrease expression \nof apoC-III, which impedes the clearance ofVLDL, and increases \nthe expression of apoA-1 and apoA-11, which in turn increases \nHDL levels. In most patients, flbrates have little or no effect on \nLDL concentrations. However, fibrates can increase LDL choles\u00ad\nterol in patients with a genetic condition called familial combined \nhyperlipoproteinemia (FCH), which is associated with a com\u00ad\nbined increase in VLDL and LDL. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "B. Clinical Use \nGemflbrozil and other fibrates are used to treat hypertriglyceride\u00ad\nmia. Because these drugs have only a modest ability to reduce LDL \ncholesterol and can increase LDL cholesterol in some patients, \nthey might be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs \nfor treatment of patients with elevated concentrations of both \nLDL and VLDL. Since adding a fibrate to a high-intensity statin \ndoes not confer further cardiovascular risk reduction, yet increases \nrisk of toxicity, the combination is no longer recommended as \ninitial approach to treat most patients with devated LDL-C and \ntriglycerides. \nC. Toxicity \nNausea is the most common adverse effect with all members of \nthe fl.bric acid derivatives subgroup. Skin rashes are common with \ngemflbrozil. A few patients show decreases in white blood count \nor hematocrit, and these drugs can potentiate the action of antico\u00ad\nagulants. There is an increased risk of cholesterol gallstones; these \ndrugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of \ncholelithiasis. When used in combination with reductase inhibi\u00ad\ntors, the flbrates significantly increase the risk of myopathy. \nCOMBINATION THERAPY \nAll patients with hyperlipidemia are treated first with dietary \nmodification, but this is often insufficient and drugs must be \nadded. Drug combinations are often required to achieve the maxi\u00ad\nmum lowering possible with minimum toxicity and to achieve \nthe desired effect on the various lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, and \nHDL). \nCertain drug combinations provide advantages (Table 35-1), \nwhereas others present specific challenges. Because resins interfere \nwith the absorption of certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \n(pravastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin), these must be given at \nleast 1 h before or 4 h after the resins. The combination of reduc\u00ad\ntase inhibitors with either fibrates or niacin increases the risk of \nmyopathy. \nDRUGS RESTRICTED TO PATIENTS \nWITH HOMOZYGOUS FAMILIAL \nHYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA \nAND TREATMENT-RESISTANT \nHYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA \nLom.itapide is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) \ninhibitor. MTP plays an essential role in the accretion of triglyc-\nerides to nascent VLDL in liver and to chylomicrons in the intes-\ntine. Its inhibition decreases VLDL secretion and consequently the CHAPTER 35 Agents Used in Dyslipidemia 303 \naccumulation of LDL in plasma. An adverse effect is that it can \ncause accumulation of triglycerides in the liver and devations in \ntransaminases. \nMipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets apoB-\n100, mainly in the liver. Mild to moderate injection site reactions \nand flu-like symptoms can occur. \nEvolocumab and alirocumab are humanized antibodies to the \nenzyme PCSK9. The function of PCSK9 is to transport the LDL \nreceptor to the lysosome for degradation. LDL reductions of up to \n70% have been achieved with these agents. Adverse effects include \nlocal reactions at the injection site, and upper respiratory and flu\u00ad\nlike symptoms. PCSK9 inhibition should be approached with cau\u00ad\ntion because of its established role in normal cdl biology. These \nagents are expensive. \nQUESTIONS \nI. PJ is a 5-year--0ld boy.

Mechanism of Action \n& noted in Chapter 18, cyclooxygenase is the enzyme th.at con\u00ad\nverts arachidonic acid into the endoperoxide precursors of pros\u00ad\ntaglandins, imponant mediators of inflammation (Figure 36-1). \nCyclooxygenase has at least two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. \nCOX-1 is primarily expressed in noninflammatory cells, whereas \nCOX-2 is expressed in activated lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear \ncells, and other inflammatory cdls. \n&pirin and nonselective NSAIDs inhibit both cyclooxygen\u00ad\nase isoforms and thereby decrease prostaglandin and thromboxane \nsynthesis throughout the body. Release of prostaglandins necessary \nfor homeostatic function is disrupted, as is release of prostaglan\u00ad\ndins involved in inflammation. The COX-2-sdective inhibitors \nhave less effect on the prostaglandins involved in homeostatic \nfunction, particularly those in the gastrointestinal tract. \nThe major difference between the mechanisms of action of \naspirin and other NSAIDs is that aspirin (but not its active metab\u00ad\nolite, salicylate) acetylatcs and thereby irreversibly inhibits cyclo\u00ad\noxygenase, whereas the inhibition produced by other NSAIDs \nis reversible. The irreversible action of aspirin results in a longer \nduration of its antiplatdet effect and is the basis for its use as an \nantiplatelet drug (see Chapter 34). \n'Nabumetone is a prodrug; the half-life is for its active metabolite. \nbMajor anti-inflammatory metabolite of aspirin.

These inhibitors also suppress \nthe prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS that is stimulated by pyro\u00ad\ngens and thereby reduce fever (antipyretic action). The analgesic \nmechanism of these agents is less well understood.

Most \nimportant, they reduce prostaglandin-mediated cytoprotection \nin the gastrointestinal tract ( COX-1) and autoregulation of renal \nfunction (COX-I and COX-2). \nD. Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Use \n1. Aspirin-Aspirin has three therapeutic dose ranges: The low \nrange (<300 mg/d) is effective in reducing platelet aggregation; \nintermediate doses (300-2400 mg/d) have antipyretic and anal\u00ad\ngesic effects; and high doses (2400-4000 mg/d) are used for an \nanti-inflammatory effect. Aspirin is readily absorbed and is hydro\u00ad\nlyzed in blood and tissues to acetate and salicylic acid. Salicylate is a reversible nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. Elimination \nof salicylate is first order at low doses, with a half-life of 3-5 h. At \nhigh (anti-inflammatory) doses, half-life increases to 15 h or more \nand elimination becomes zero order. Excretion is via the kidney. \n2. Other NSAIDs-The other NSAIDs are well absorbed after \noral administration. Ibuprofen has a half-life of about 2 h, is \nrelatively safe, and is the least expensive of the older, nonselec\u00ad\ntive NSAIDs. Naproxen and piroxicam are noteworthy because \nof their longer half-lives (Table 36-1), which permit less frequent \ndosing. These other NSAIDs are used for the treatment of mild \nto moderate pain, especially the pain of musculoskeletal inflam\u00ad\nmation such as that seen in arthritis and gout. They are also used \nto treat many other conditions, including dysmenorrhea, head\u00ad\nache, and patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. Ketorolac \nis notable as a drug used mainly as a systemic analgesic, not as \nan anti-inflammatory (although it has typical nonselective NSAID \nproperties}. It is the only NSAID available in a parenteral formu\u00ad\nlation. Nonselective NSAIDs reduce polyp formation in patients \nwith primary familial adenomatous polyposis."

Aspirin- The most common adverse effect from therapeutic \nanti-inflammatory doses of aspirin is gastric upset due to COX-1 \ninhibition. Chronic use can result in gastric ulceration, upper \ngastrointestinal bleeding, and renal effects, including acute fail\u00ad\nure and interstitial nephritis. Aspirin increases the bleeding time \n(see Chapter 34). When thromboxane and prostaglandin synthesis \nis inhibited by even small doses of aspirin, persons with aspirin \nhypersensitivity (especially associated with nasal polyps) can expe\u00ad\nrience asthma from the increased synthesis of leukotrienes. This \ntype of hypersensitivity to aspirin precludes treatment with any \nNSAID. At higher doses of aspirin, tinnitus, vertigo, hyperventila\u00ad\ntion, and respiratory alkalosis are observed. At very high doses, \nthe drug causes metabolic acidosis, dehydration, hyperthermia, \ncollapse, coma, and death. Children with viral infections who are \ntreated with aspirin have an increased risk for developing Reye \nsyndrome, a rare but serious syndrome of rapid liver degeneration \nand encephalopathy. Use ofNSAIDs in pregnancy at 20 weeks or \nlater can result in low amniotic fluid production by the fetus and is \nnot recommended. There is no specific antidote for aspirin. \n2. Nonselective NSAIDs-Like aspirin, these agents are associ\u00ad\nated with significant gastrointestinal disturbance, but the incidence \nis lower than with aspirin. There is a risk of renal damage with \nany of the NSAIDs, especially in patients with preexisting renal \ndisease. Because these drugs are cleared by the kidney, renal dam\u00ad\nage results in higher, more toxic serum concentrations. Use of par\u00ad\nenteral ketorolac is generally restricted to 72 h because of the risk \nof gastrointestinal and renal damage with longer administration. \nSerious hematologic reactions have been noted with indomethacin . \n3. COX-2-selectlve Inhibitors-The COX-2-selective inhibi\u00ad\ntors (ccleamb, ro&coxib, valdecoxib) have a reduced risk of \ngastrointestinal effects, including gastric ulcers and serious gastro\u00ad\nintestinal bleeding. The COX-2 inhibitors carry the same risk of \nrenal damage as nonselective COX inhibitors, presumably because \nCOX-2 contributes to homeostatic renal effects. Clinical trial data \nsuggest that highly selective COX-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib \nand valdecoxib carry an increased risk of myocardial infarction \nand stroke. The increased risk of arterial thrombosis is believed to \nbe due to the COX-2 inhibitors having a greater inhibitory effect \non endothelial prostacyclin (PGl2) formation than on platelet \nTXA2 formation. Prostacyclin promotes vasodilation and inhibits \nplatelet aggregation, whereas TXA2 has the opposite effects. Sev\u00ad\neral COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib, valdecoxib) have been removed \nfrom the market, and the remaining drug in this category, cele\u00ad\ncoxib, carries a warning of increased thrombosis risk. \nACETAMINOPHEN \nA. Classlflcatlon and Prototype \nAcetaminophen is the only over-the-counter non-anti-inflammatory \nanalgesic commonly available in the United States. Phenacetin, a \ntoxic prodrug that is metabolized to acetaminophen, is still avail\u00ad\nable in some other countries. B. Mechanism of Adion \nThe mechanism of analgesic action of acetaminophen is unclear. \nThe drug is only a weak COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor in periph\u00ad\neral tissues, which accounts for its lack of anti-inflammatory effect. \nEvidence suggests that acetaminophen may inhibit a third enzyme, \nCOX-3, in the CNS. \nC. Effeds \nAcetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic agent; it lacks anti\u00ad\ninflammatory or antiplatelet effects. \nD. Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Use \nAcetaminophen is effective for the same indications as intermediate\u00ad\ndose aspirin. Acetaminophen is therefore useful as an aspirin substi\u00ad\ntute, especially in children with viral infections and in those with \nany type of aspirin intolerance. Acetaminophen is well absorbed \norally and metabolized in the liver. Its half-life, which is 2-3 h in \npersons with normal hepatic function, is unaffected by renal disease. \nE. Toxicity \nIn therapeutic dosages, acetaminophen has negligible toxicity in \nmost persons. However, when taken in overdose or by patients with \nsevere liver impairment, the drug is a dangerous hepatotoxin. The \nmechanism of toxicity involves oxidation to cytotoxic intermediates \nby phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes. This occurs if substrates for \nphase II conjugation reactions (acetate and glucuronide) are lacking \n(see Chapter 4). Prompt administration of acetylcysteine, a sulfhy\u00ad\ndryl donor, may be lifesaving after an overdose. People who regularly \nconsume 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day are at increased risk of \nacetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (see Chapters 4 and 23). \nSKILL KEEPER: OPIOID ANALGESICS AND \nANTAGONISTS (SEE CHAPTER31) \nAlthough NSAIDs and acetaminophen are extremely useful \nfor the treatment of mild to moderate pain, adequate control \nof more intense pain often requires treatment with an opioid. \n1. Name 1 strong, 1 moderate, and 1 weak opioid drug. \n2. Briefly describe the most common adverse effects of strong \nand moderate opioids. \n3.

Toxicity \nAll DMARDs can activate latent tuberculosis and cause severe \ntoxicities. Careful monitoring is mandatory. Their major adverse \neffects arc listed in Table 36-2. \nDRUGS USED IN GOUT \nA. Classlflcatlon and Prototypes \nGout is associated with increased scrum concentrations of uric \nacid. Acute attacks involve joint inflammation initiated by precipi\u00ad\ntation of uric acid crystals. Treatment strategics include (1) reduc\u00ad\ning inflammation during acute attacks (with colchicinc, NSAIDs, \nor glucocorticoids; Figure 36-2); (2) accelerating renal excretion \nof uric acid with uricosuric drugs (probcnccid or sulfinpyrazonc); \nand (3) reducing (with allopurinol or febuxostat) the conversion of \npurines to uric acid by xanthine oxidase (Figure 36-3). B. Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Used for Gout \n1. Mechanisms-NSAIDs such as indomethacin are effective in \ninhibiting the inflammation of acute gouty arthritis. These agents \nact through the reduction of prostaglandin formation and the inhi\u00ad\nbition of urate crystal phagocytosis by macrophages (Figure 36-2). \nColcbicine, a selective inhibitor of microtubule assembly, reduces \nleukocyte migration and phagocytosis; the drug may also reduce \nproduction of leukotriene B4 and decrease free radical formation. \n2. Effects-NSAIDs and glucocorticoids reduce the synthesis of \ninflammatory mediators in the gouty joint. Because it reacts with \ntubulin and interferes with microtubule assembly, colchicine is a \ngeneral mitotic poison. Tubulin is necessary for normal cell divi\u00ad\nsion, motility, and many other processes. \n3. Pharmacakinetics and clinical use-An NSAID or a glu\u00ad\ncocorticoid is preferred for the treatment of acute gouty arthri\u00ad\ntis. Although colchicinc can be used for acute attacks, the doses \nrequired cause significant gastrointestinal disturbance, particularly \ndiarrhea. Lower doses of colchicine are used to prevent attacks of \ngout in patients with a history of multiple acute attacks. Colchi\u00ad\ncine is also of value in the management of familial Mediterranean \nfever, a disease of unknown cause characterized by fever, hepa\u00ad\ntitis, peritonitis, pleuritis, arthritis, and, occasionally, amyloido\u00ad\nsis. lndomethacin, some glucocorticoids, and colchicine are used \norally; parenteral preparations of glucocorticoids and colchicine \nare also available. \n4. Toxlclty-NSAIDs can cause renal damage, and indomethacin \ncan additionally cause bone marrow depression. Short courses of \nglucocorticoids can cause behavioral changes and impaired glucose \ncontrol. Because colchicine can severely damage the liver and kid\u00ad\nney, dosage must be carefully limited and monitored. Overdose is \noften fatal. \nC. Uricosuric Agents \n1. Mechanism-Normally, over 90% of the uric acid filtered by \nthe kidney is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. U ricosuric agents \n(probenecld, sulfinpyrazone) are weak acids that compete with \nuric acid for reabsorption by the weak acid transport mechanism \nin the proximal tubules and thereby increase uric acid excretion. \nAt low doses, these agents may also compete with uric acid for \nAlloxanthine, \nfebuxostat \n0 \nN \n:~ \nN \nH \nHypoxanthlna [;] 0:6:> \nH H [;] 0:6:>-00 \nH H \nXanlhlna Uric acid \nFIGURE 36-3 The action ofxanthine oxidase in uric acid synthesis.

Elevation of uric acid levels \nby this mechanism occurs with aspirin (another weak acid) over \nmuch of its dose range. \n2. Effects-Uricosuric drugs inhibit the secretion of a large \nnumber of other weak acids (eg, penicillin, methotrexate) in addi\u00ad\ntion to inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid. \n3. Pharmacokinetics and clinical use-Uricosuric drugs are \nused orally to treat chronic gout, caused by under-excretion of uric \nacid. These drugs are of no value in acute episodes and are contra\u00ad\nindicated in overproducers of uric acid. \n4. Toxidty-Uricosuric drugs can precipitate an attack of acute \ngout during the early phase of their action. This can be avoided by \nsimultaneously administering colchicine or indomethacin. Because \nthey are sulfonamides, the uricosuric drugs may share allergenicity \nwith other classes of sulfonamide drugs (diuretics, antimicrobials, \noral hypoglycemic drugs). \nD. Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors \n1. Mechanism-The production of uric acid can be reduced by \ninhibition of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypo\u00ad\nxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (Figure 36-3). \nAllopurinol is converted to oxypurinol (alloxanthine) by xan\u00ad\nthine oxidase; alloxanthine is an irreversible suicide inhibitor of \nthe enzyme. The newer drug febuxost.at is a nonpurine inhibi\u00ad\ntor of xanthine oxidase that is more selective than allopurinol and \nalloxanthine, which inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and \npyrimidine metabolism. \n2. Effects-Inhibition of xanthine oxidase increases the con\u00ad\ncentrations of the more soluble hypoxanthine and xanthine and \ndecreases the concentration of the less soluble uric acid. As a result, \nthere is less likelihood of precipitation of uric acid crystals in joints \nand tissues. Clinical trials suggest that febuxostat is more effective \nthan allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid. \n3. Pharmacokinetics and clinical use-The xanthine oxidase \ninhibitors are given orally in the management of chronic gout. Like \nuricosuric agents, these drugs are usually withheld fur 1-2 weeks \nafter an acute episode of gouty arthritis and are administered in \ncombination with colchicine or an NSAID to avoid an acute \nattack. Allopurinol is also used as an adjunct to cancer chemo\u00ad\ntherapy to slow the formation of uric acid from purines released by \nthe death of large numbers of neoplastic cells. \n4. Toxicity and drug interactions-Allopurinol causes gastro\u00ad\nintestinal upset, rash, and rarely, peripheral neuritis, vasculitis, or \nbone marrow dysfunction, including aplastic anemia. Allopurinol \ncan induce a severe, potentially fatal allopurinol hypersensitivity \nreaction (AHS) in patients with the HLA-B*5BOJ allele. Genetic screening is recommended in populations of interest. Allopurinol \nis contraindicated in renal insufficiency. It inhibits the metabo\u00ad\nlism of mercaptopurine and azathioprine, drugs that depend on \nxanthine oxidase for elimination. Febuxostat can be used in renal \ninsufficiency. It can cause liver function abnormalities , head\u00ad\nache, and gastrointestinal upset. It carries a black box warning for \nincreased risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. \nE.Urlcase \n1. Mechanlsm-Pegloticue is a recombinant mammalian uri\u00ad\ncase. This enzyme, absent in humans, converts uric acid to the \nsoluble allantoin, which can be eliminated by the kidney. \n2. Effect-An IV dose of pegloticase dose lowers urate levels \nwithin 24-72 hours. \n3. Clinical use-Pegloticase is approved fur the treatment of \nrefractory chronic gout. \n4. Adverse effects-Gout flare can occur during treatment with \npegloticase, especially during the first 3-6 months of treatment, \nrequiring prophylaxis with NSAIDs or colchicine. The drug is \nextremely expensive. \nQUESTIONS \nI. In individuals who need antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI, stenting), aspirin is the NSAID of \nchoice. Among NSAIDs, aspirin is unique because it \n(A) Irreversibly inhibits its target enzyme \n(B) Prevents episodes of gouty arthritis with long-term use \n(C) Reduces fever \n(D) Increases the risk of colon cancer \n(E) Selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme \n2.

This chapter focuses on the agents used commonly; refer to \nthe full text (Basic and Clinical Pharmacology) for hormones that are \neither not used clinically or are used soldy for specialized diagnostic \ntesting (thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH], thyroid-stimulating \nhormone [TSH], corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], adreno\u00ad\ncorticotropic hormone [ACTH], and growth hormone-releasing \nhormone [GHRH]}. Hormones of the anterior pituitary are cen\u00ad\ntral links in the hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine system (or axis; \nFigure 37-1). All the anterior pituitary hormones are under the con\u00ad\ntrol of a hypothalamic hormone, and with the exception of prolac\u00ad\ntin, all mediate their ultimate effects by regulating the production \nby peripheral tissues of other hormones (Table 37-1). Four ante\u00ad\nrior pituitary hormones (TSH, LH, FSH, and ACTH) and their \nhypothalamic regulators are subject to feedback regulation by the \nhormones whose production they control. The complex systems \nthat regulate hormones of the anterior pituitary provide multiple \navenues of pharmacologic intervention. \nA. Growth Hormone and Mecasermln \n1. GH-Growth hormone is required fur normal growth during \nchildhood and adolescence and is an important regulator through\u00ad\nout life oflipid and carbohydrate metabolism and lean body mass. \nIts effects are primarily mediated by regulating the production in \nperipheral tissues of insulin-like growth &ctor I (IGF-1). Somatropin, the recombinant form of human GH, is used \nfor GH deficiency in children and adults and in the treatment \nof children with genetic diseases associated with shon stature (eg. \nTurner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome}. \nGH treatment also improves growth in children with failure to \nthrive due to chronic renal failure or the small-for-gestational-age \ncondition. The most controversial use of GH is for children with \nidiopathic shon stature who are not GH deficient. In this group \nof children, multiple years of GH therapy at great cost and some \nrisk of toxicity results in a small (1.5-3 inches) average increase in \nfinal adult height. \nIn adults, GH has efficacy in treatment of AIDS-associated \nwasting and GH deficiency, and it may improve gastrointestinal \nfunction in patients who have undergone intestinal resection and \nhave subsequently devdoped a malabsorption syndrome. GH is \na popular component of unscientific antiaging programs even \nthough studies in modd animal systems have consistently found \nthat analogs of GH and IGF-1 shorten lifespan. GH is also used \nby athletes fur a purported increase in muscle mass and athletic \nperformance and is one of the drugs banned by the Interna\u00ad\ntional Olympic Committee and professional sports associations. \nRecombinant bovine GH is used in dairy cattle to increase milk \nproduction. \nRare but serious adverse effects of GH in children include pseu\u00ad\ndotumor cerebri, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, progression \nof scoliosis, edema, and hyperglycemia. Children with GH defi\u00ad\nciency should be monitored periodically for concurrent deficiency \nof other anterior pituitary hormones. Adults generally tolerate GH \nless well than children. Adverse effects include peripheral edema, \nmyalgia, and arthralgia. \n2. Mecasennin-A small group of children with growth failure \nunresponsive to GH therapy are deficient in IGF-1. Mecasermin, \nrecombinant human I GF-1, is administered parenterally to children \nwith IGF-1 deficiency. Its mostimportant toxicity is hypoglycemia, \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

CHAPTER 37 Hypothalamic & Pituitary Hormones 321 \nB. Growth Hormone Antagonists \nGH-secreting pituitary adenomas cause acromegaly in adults and, \nrarely, gigantism in children and adolescents who have not com\u00ad\npleted their growth phase. Pharmacologic treatment of GH excess \nseeks to inhibit GH secretion or interfere with GH effects. \n1. Somatostatin analogs-Somatostatin, a 14-amino-acid \npeptide, inhibits the release of GH, glucagon, insulin, and gas\u00ad\ntrin. Octreotide and lanreotide, long-acting synthetic analogs of \nsomatostatin, are used to treat acromegaly, carcinoid , gastrinoma, \nglucagonoma, and other endocrine tumors. Regular octreotide \nmust be administered subcutaneously 2--4 times daily, whereas a \nslow-release intramuscular formulation of octreotide or lanreotide \nis administered every 4 weeks for long-term therapy. Octreotide \nand lanreotide may cause significant gastrointestinal disturbances, \ngallstones, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. \n2. Dopamine D2 receptor agonists-Dopamine 02 receptor \nagonists such as bromocriptine are more effective at inhibiting \nprolactin release than inhibiting GH release (see following text). \nHowever, high doses ofD2 receptor agonists have some efficacy in \nthe treatment of small GH-secreting tumors. \n3. Pegvisomant-Pegvisomant is a GH receptor antagonist \napproved for treatment of acromegaly. Normally, GH, which has \ntwo distinct receptor binding sites, initiates cellular signaling cas\u00ad\ncades by dimerizing two GH receptors. Pegvisomant is a long\u00ad\nacting derivative of a mutant GH that is able to cross-link GH \nreceptors but is incapable of inducing the conformational changes \nrequired for receptor activation. \nC. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing Hormone, \nand Their Analogs \nIn women, FSH directs follicle development, whereas FSH and \nLH collaborate in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis. In \nmen, FSH is the primary regulator of spermatogenesis, whereas \nLH is the main stimulus for testicular androgen production. The \ngonadotropins or their analogs are used in combination to stimu\u00ad\nlate spermatogenesis in infertile men and to induce ovulation in \nwomen with anovulation that is not responsive to less complicated \ntreatments (see Chapter 40). In men, the treatment of infertility \ndue to hypogonadism requires months of administration of a mix\u00ad\nture of drugs with LH and FSH activity. \nOvulation induction protocols are complex. They require close \nmonitoring to ensure successful insemination or retrieval of mature \noocytes and to prevent the two most serious complications of ovu\u00ad\nlation induction-multiple pregnancies and the ovarian hyper~ \nstimulation syndrome, a syndrome of ovarian enlargement, ascites, \nhypovolemia, and occasionally, shock. All ovulation induction pro\u00ad\ntocols that use gonadotropins have three basic steps. First, endog~ \nenous gonadotropin production is inhibited by administration of a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist (see text that follows). Second, follicle \ndevelopment is driven by daily injections of a preparation with FSH \nactivity (menotropins , FSH, or an FSH analog). Last, the final stage"

All are \nadministered parenterally. \nf. Menotropins- These gonadotropins consist of a mixture of \nFSH and LH purified from the urine of postmenopausal women \n(who produce high levels ofFSH and LH owing to the disinhihi\u00ad\ntion of pituitary gonadotropin production that results from cessa\u00ad\ntion of ovarian steroidogenesis). \n2. FSH and its analogs-Three forms of FSH are available. \nUrofollittopin is a purified preparation extracted from the urine \nof postmenopausal women. The two recombinant forms of human \nFSH-follit.ropin alpha and follitropin beta-differ in the com\u00ad\nposition of their carbohydrate side chains. \n3. LH and its analogs-hCG, the placental protein that sup\u00ad\nports the corpus luteum during the early stages of pregnancy, has \na structure that is nearly identical to LH and mediates its effects \nthrough activation of LH receptors. hCG purified from human \nurine or recombinant hCG is used commonly for LH action. \nLutropin, a recombinant form of human LH, is also available. \nD. Gonadotropln-Releaslng Hormone and Its Analogs \nGnRH is a decapeptide that stimulates gonadotropin release when \nit is secreted in a pulsatik pattern by the hypothalamus. Leuprolide \nwas the first of a set of synthetic peptides with long-acting GnRH \nagonist activity. Other long-acting GnRH agonists include gos\u00ad\nerelin, histrdin, nafarelin, and triptorelin. \nIn men and women, steady dosing with these GnRH agonists \ninhibitI gonadotropin release by downregulating GnRH receptors \nin the pituitary cells that normally release gonadotropins. Con\u00ad\ntinuous GnRH agonist treatment is used to suppress endogenous \ngonadotropin secretion in women undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotropins, in women with gynecologic disorders that \nbenefit from ovarian suppression (eg, endometriosis, uterine leio\u00ad\nmyomata), in men with advanced prostate cancer, in early puber\u00ad\ntal transgender adolescents (to block endogenous puberty prior to \ntreatment with cross-gender gonadal hormones), and in children \nwith central precocious puberty. \nIn women, continuous treatment with a GnRH agonist causes \nthe typical symptoms of menopause (hot flushes, sweats, head\u00ad\nache). Long-term treatment is avoided because of the risk of bone \nloss and osteoporosis. In men treated continuously with a GnRH \nagonist, adverse effects include hot flushes, sweats, gynecomastia, \nreduced libido, decreased hematocrit, and reduced bone density. \nIn men with prostate cancer and children with central precocious \npuberty, the first few weeks of therapy can temporarily exacerbate \nthe condition {cause a \"flare\"). \nE. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists \nGanirelix, cetrordix, and degarelix are GnRH receptor antagonists. \nGanirelix and cetroreli.x can he used during ovulation induction in \nplace of GnRH agonists to suppress endogenous gonadotropin pro\u00ad\nduction. Degarelix is approved for the treatment of advanced pros\u00ad\ntate cancer. The adverse effects of GnRH antagonists are similar to \nthose associated with continuous treatment with a GnRH agonise \nexcept that they do not cause a tumor flare when used for treatment \nof advanced prostate cancer and they may he less likely to cause \nthe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when used for ovulation \ninduction. \nF. Proladin Antagonists (Dopamine D2 Receptor Agonists) \nThe anterior pituitary hormone prolactin regulates lactation. In \nwomen and men, hyperprolactinemia and an associated syndrome \nof infertility and galactorrhea can result from prolactin-secreting \nadenomas.

As previously mentioned, \nhigh doses of a dopamine agonist can also be used in the treatment \nof acromegaly. \nSKILL KEEPER: DRUGS THAT CAUSE \nHYPERPROLACTINEMIA (SEE CHAPTER 29) \nAs many as 2596 of infertile women have hyperprolactinemia. \nIn women, hyperprolactinemia causes galactorrhea, oligomen\u00ad\norrhea, or amenorrhea as well as Infertility (the amenorrhea\u00ad\ngalactorrhea syndrome). Although prolactin-secreting \ntumors are the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, \nthe condition can also be precipitated by drugs that interfere \nwith the control of prolactin release. \n1. What types of pharmacologlc actions are most likely to \ncause hyperprolactinemia? \n2. Name several drugs with this pharmacologlc action. \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nPOSTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES \nA.Oxytocln \nOxytocin is a nonapeptide synthesized in cell bodies in the para\u00ad\nventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and transported through \nthe axons of these cells to the posterior piwitary (Figure 37-1). \nOxytocin is an effective stimulant of uterine contraction and is \nused intravenously to induce or reinforce labor. Atosiban is an \nantagonist of the oxytocin receptor that is used in some countries \nas a toa>lytlc, a drug used to suppress preterm labor. It is not FDA \napproved. \nB. Vasopressin (Antidiuretic Hormone) \nVasopressin is synthesized in neuronal cell bodies in the hypothal\u00ad\namus and released from nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary \n(Figure 3 7-1). As discussed in Chapters 15 and 17, vasopressin \nacts through V2 receptors to increase the insertion of water chan\u00ad\nnels in the apical membranes of collecting duct cells in the kidney \nand to thereby provide an antidiuretic effect. Extrarenal V2-like \nreceptors regulate the release of coagulation factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor (see Chapter 34). Desmop.rasio, a selective \nagonist ofV2 receptors, is administered orally, nasally, or parenter\u00ad\nally in patients with pituitary diabetes insipidus and in patients \nwith mild hemophilia A or van Wtllebrand disease. \nVasopressin also contracts vascular smooth muscle by activat\u00ad\ning V1 receptors . Because of this vasoconstrictor effect, vasopressin \nis sometimes used to treat patients with bleeding from esophageal \nvarices or colon diverticula. \nSeveral antagonists of vasopressin receptors (eg, conivapt.an, \ntolvaptan) have been developed to offset the fluid retention that CHAPTER 37 Hypothalamic & Pituitary Hormones 323 \nresults from the excessive production of vasopressin and is associ\u00ad\nated with hyponatremia or acute heart failure (see Chapter 15). \nQUESTIONS \nI. A young couple (25-year-old male, 23-year-old female) wants \nto start a family. They have not conceived after 1 year of \nunprotected intercourse. Infertility evaluation revealed no \nabnormalities in the female partner and low sperm count in \nthe male. Which of the following is a drug that is purified \nfrom the urine of postmenopausal women and is used to pro\u00ad\nmote spermatogenesis in infertile men? \n(A) Desmopressin \n(B) Gonadorelin \n(C) Goserelin \n(D) Somatropin \n(E) Urofollitropin \n2. A 29-year-old woman in her 41st week of gestation has been \nin labor for 12 h. Although her uterine contractions had been \nstrong and regular initially, they have diminished in force dur\u00ad\ning the past hour. Which of the following agents would be \nused to facilitate this woman's labor and delivery? \n(A) Dopamine \n(B) Leuprolide \n(C) Oxytocin \n(D) Prolactin \n(E) Vasopressin \n3. A 3-year-old boy with failure to thrive and metabolic distur\u00ad\nbances was found to have an inactivating mutation in the \ngene that encodes the growth hormone receptor. Which of \nthe following drugs is most likely to improve his metabolic \nfunction and promote his growth? \n(A) Atosiban \n(B) Bromocriptine \n(C) Mecasermin \n(D) Octreotide \n(E) Somatropin \n4. An important difference between leuprolide and ganirelix is \nthat ganirelix \n(A) Can be administered as an oral formulation \n(B) Can be used alone to restore fertility to hypogonad.al \nmen and women \n(C) Immediately reduces gonadotropin secretion \n(D) Initially stimulates pituitary production ofLH and FSH \n(E) Must be administered in a pulsatile fashion \n5. A 27-year-old woman with amenorrhea, infertility, and galac\u00ad\ntorrhea was treated with a drug that successfully restored \novulation and menstruation. Before being given the drug, \nthe woman was carefully questioned about previous mental \nhealth problems, which she did not have. She was advised to \ntake the drug orally. Which of the following was used to treat \nthis patient? \n(A) Bromocriptine \n(B) Desmopressin \n(C) Human gonadotropin hormone \n(D) Leuprolide \n(E) Octreotide"

Spermatogenesis in males requires the action ofFSH and LH. \nUrofollitropin, which is purified from the urine of postmeno\u00ad\npausal women, is used clinically to provide FSH activity. The \nanswer is E. \n2. Oxytocin is an effective stimulant of uterine contraction that \nis routinely used to augment labor. The answer is C. \n3. This child's condition is due to the inability of GH to stimu\u00ad\nlate the production of insulin-like growth factors, the ulti\u00ad\nmate mediators of GH effects. Mecasermin, a combination \nof recombinant IGF-1 and the binding protein that protects \nIGF-1 from immediate destruction, will help correct the IGF \ndeficiency. Because of the inactive GH receptors, somatropin \nwill not be effective. The answer is C. \n4. Leuprolide is an agonist of GnRH receptors, whereas gani\u00ad\nrelix is an antagonist. Although both drugs can be used to \ninhibit gonadotropin release, ganirelix does so immediately, \nwhereas leuprolide does so only after about 1 week of sus\u00ad\ntained activity. The answer is C. \n5. Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, is used to treat \nthe amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, which is a conse\u00ad\nquence of hyperprolactinemia. Because of its central dopami\u00ad\nnergic effects, the drug should not be used in patients with a \nhistory of schizophrenia or other forms of psychotic illness. \nThe answer is A. \n6. ACTH is used diagnostically in suspected adrenal insuf\u00ad\nficiency. CRH is used to distinguish Cushing disease from \nectopic ACTH secretion. GHRH is rarely used as treatment. \nIts main use is as a diagnostic tool. GnRH can be used to treat \ninfenility. Somatropin, recombinant human GH, promotes \ngrowth in children with Turner syndrome (an XO genetic \ngenotype) or chronic renal failure. It also helps combat the \nAIDS-associated wasting syndrome. The answer is E. \n7. In precocious puberty, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal \naxis becomes prematurely active for reasons that are not \nunderstood. Treatment involves suppressing gonadotropin \nsecretion with continuous administration of a long-acting \nGnRH agonist such as leuprolide. The answer is C. \n8. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, has some efficacy in reduc\u00ad\ning the excess GH production that causes acromegaly. The \nanswer is D. \n9. Once the patient's endogenous gonadotropin production has \nbeen inhibited through continuous administration of the \nGnRH agonist leuprolide, the next step in ovulation induc\u00ad\ntion is the administration of a drug with FSH activity to stim~ \nulate follicle maturation. Follitropin is recombinant FSH. \nThe only other drug listed that is used in ovulation induction \nis hCG, but this is an LH analog. The answer is B. \n10. Pituitary diabetes insipidus results from deficiency in vaso\u00ad\npressin. It is treated with desmopressin, a peptide agonist of \nvasopressin V2 receptors. The answer is B. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Thyroxine and triiodothyronine have broad \neffects on growth, development, and metabolism. Calcitonin is important in calciwn metabolism and is discussed in Chapter 42. \nThis chapter describes the drugs used in the treatment of hypo\u00ad\nthyroidism and hyperthyroidism. \nDn.igs used in thyroid disease \nThioamides _;::r:;_ \nL.evothyroxine Liothyronine Hyperthyroidism \n(T4) CTs) (propythlouracl) Iodide \n[ (Lugol solution) J Beta blockers \n(propranolol) \nTHYROID HORMONES \nA. Synthesis and Transport of Thyroid Hormones \nThe thyroid secretes two iodine-containing hormones: thyroxine \n(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The iodine necessary for the syn\u00ad\nthesis of these molecules comes from food or iodide supplements. \nIodide ion is actively taken up by and highly concentrated in the \nthyroid gland, where it is converted to elemental iodine by thyroi\u00ad\ndal peroxidase (Figure 38-1). The protein thyroglobulin serves as \na scaffold for thyroid hormone synthesis. Tyrosine residues in thy\u00ad\nroglobulin arc iodinated to form monoiodocyrosine (MIT) or diio\u00ad\ndotyrosine (DIT) in a process known as iodine organification. \nWithin thyroglobulin, two molecules of DIT combine to form \nT4, while one molecule each of MIT and DIT combine to form \nT 3\u2022 Proteolysis of thyroglobulin liberates the T 4 and T 3, which are \nthen released from the thyroid. After release from the gland, T 4 \n328 and T 3 are transported in the blood by tbyronne-binding globulin; \na protein synthesized in the liver. \nThyroid function is controlled by the pituitary through the \nrelease of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) (see \nFigure 37-1) and by the availability ofiodide. Thyrotropin stimu\u00ad\nlates the uptake of iodide as well as synthesis and release of thyroid \nhormone. It also has a growth-promoting effect that causes thy\u00ad\nroid cell hyperplasia and an enlarged gland (goiter). High levels of \nthyroid hormones inhibit the release of TSH, providing an effec\u00ad\ntive negative feedback control mechanism. In Graves disease, an \nautoimmune disorder, B lymphocytes produce an antibody that \nactivates the TSH receptor and can cause a syndtome of hyperthy\u00ad\nroidism called thyrotoxic:ow. Because these lymphocytes are not \nsusceptible to negative feedback, patients with Graves disease can \nhave very high blood concentrations of thyroid hormone at the \nsame time that their blood concentrations ofTSH are very low. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Effects of thyroid hormone-The organ-level actions of \nthe thyroid hormones include normal growth and devdopment \nof the nervous, skeletal, and reproductive systems and control of \nmetabolism of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. The \nkey features of excess thyroid activity (thyrotoxicosis) and hypo\u00ad\nthyroidism are listed in Table 38-1. \n2. Clinical use-Thyroid hormone therapy can be accomplished \nwith either T 4 or T 3\u2022 Synthetic levotbyroxi.ne (T J is usually the \nform of choice. T 3 (liothyronine) is faster acting but has a shorter \nhalf-life and is more expensive. \n3. Toxicity-Toxicity is that of thyrotoxicosis (Table 38-1). \nOlder patients, those with cardiovascular disease, and those with \nlongstanding myxedema are highly sensitive to the stimulatory \neffects of T 4 on the hean. Such patients should receive lower initial \ndoses ofT4\u2022 SKILL KEEPER: THE CYCLIC AMP SECOND\u00ad\nMESSENGER SYSTEM (SEE CHAPTER 2) \nUke many neurotransmitters and hormones, TSH mediates its \nefferu in thyroid cells by activating the cAMP (cyclic adenos\u00ad\nine monophosphate) second-messenger system. Draw a dia\u00ad\ngram that shows the key events in this pathway, beginning \nwith the binding of an agonist to its receptor and ending with \ncellular responses. \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nANTITHYROID DRUGS \nA. Thioamides \nMethimamle and propylthiowacil (PTIJ) are small sulfur-contain\u00ad\ning thioamides that inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by blocking \nperoxidase-catalyzed reactions, iodination of the tyrosine residues of \nthyroglobulin, and coupling of DIT and MIT (Figure 38-1). Pro\u00ad\npylthiouracil and, to a much lesser extent, methimazole inhibit \nperipheral conversion of T4 to T3\u2022 Because the thioamides do not \ninhibit the rdease of preformed thyroid hormone, their onset of \nactivity is usually slow, often requiring 3-4 weeks for full effect. \nThe thioamides can be used by the oral route and are effective in \nyoung patients with small glands and mild disease. Methimazole \nis generally preferred because it can be administered once per day. \nHowever, PTU is preferred in pregnancy and lactation because it \nis less likely than methimazole to cross the placenta and to enter \nbreast milk. Toxic effects include skin rash (common) and severe \nreactions (rare} such as vasculitis, agranulocytosis, hypoprothrom\u00ad\nbinemia, and liver dysfunction. These effects are usually reversible. \nB. Iodide Salts and Iodine \nIodide salts inhibit iodination of tyrosine and thyroid hormone \nrelease (Figure 38-1); these salts also decrease the size and vascular\u00ad\nity of the hyperplastic thyroid gland. Because iodide salts inhibit \nrelease as well as synthesis of the hormones, their onset of action \noccurs rapidly, within 2-7 d. However, the effects are transient; the \nthyroid gland \"escapes\" from the iodide block after several weeks \nof treatment. Iodide salts are used in the management of thyroid \nstorm and to prepare patients for surgical resection of a hyperactive \nthyroid. The usual forms of this drug are Lugo! solution (iodine \nand potassium iodide) and saturated solution of potusium iodide. \nAdverse effects include rash, drug fever, metallic taste, bleeding dis\u00ad\norders, and, rarely, anaphylactic reactions. \nC. Radioactive Iodine \nRadioactive iodine (1311) is taken up and concentrated in the thy\u00ad\nroid gland so avidly that a dose large enough to severdy damage \nthe gland can be given without endangering other tissues. Unlike \nthe thioamides and iodide salts, an effective dose of 1311 can pro-\nd f th . .

Other Drugs \nAn important class of drugs for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis is \nthe ~ blockers. These agents are particularly useful in controlling \nthe tachycardia and other cardiac abnormalities of severe thyro\u00ad\ntoxicosis. Propranolol also inhibits the peripheral conversion of \nT4 to T3 at doses greater than 160 mg/d. \nThe iodine-containing antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone \n(see Chapter 14) can cause hypothyroidism through its ability \nto block the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3\u2022 It also can cause \nhyperthyroidism either through an iodine-induced mechanism in \npersons with an underlying thyroid disease such as multinodu\u00ad\nlar goiter or through an inflammatory mechanism that causes \nleakage of thyroid hormone into the circulation. Amiodarone\u00ad\nassociated hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone. Iodine\u00ad\nassociated hyperthyroidism caused by amiodarone is treated with \nthioamides, whereas the inflammatory version is best treated with \ncorticosteroids. \nIodinated radiocontrast media (eg, oral diatrizoate and intrave\u00ad\nnous iohexol) rapidly suppress the conversion of T 4 to T 3 in the \nliver, kidney, and other peripheral tissues. \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1-3.

They consist of two major physiologic and pharmaco\u00ad\nlogic groups: (1} glucocorticoids, which have important effects on \ncarbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, catabolism, immune responses, and inflammation; and (2) mineralocorticoids, which \nregulate sodium and potassium reabsorption in the collecting \ntubules of the kidney.

Mechanism of Action \nCorticosteroids enter the cell and bind to cytosolic receptors that \ntransport the steroid into the nucleus. The steroid-receptor complex: \nalters gene ex:pression by binding to glucocorticoid response de\u00ad\nments (GREs} or mineralocorticoid-speciflc dements (Figure 39-1). \nTissue-specific responses to steroids are made possible by the pres\u00ad\nence in each tissue of different protein regulators that control the \ninteraction between the hormone-receptor complex and particular \nDNA response elements. \nB. Organ and Tissue Effects \n1. Metabolic effects-Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogen\u00ad\nesis. As a result, blood glucose rises, muscle protein is catabolized, \nand insulin secretion is stimulated. Both lipolysis and lipogenesis \n334 are stimulated, with a net increase of f.u deposition in certain areas \n(eg, the face and the shoulders and back}. \n2. Catabolic effects-Glucocorticoids cause muscle protein \ncatabolism. In addition, lymphoid and connective tissue, fat, and \nskin undergo wasting under the influence of high concentrations \nof these steroids. Catabolic effects on bone can lead to osteoporo\u00ad\nsis. In children, growth is reduced. \n3. lmmunosuppressive effects-Glucocorticoids inhibit cell\u00ad\nmediated immunologic functions, especially those dependent \non lymphocytes. These agents are actively lymphotoxic and, as \nsuch, are important in the treatment of hematologic cancers. The \ndrugs do not interfere with the devdopment of normal acquired \nimmunity but dday rejection reactions in patients with organ \ntransplants. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

This is an important \ncause of hypertension in patients with a cortisol-secreting adrenal \ntumor or a pituitary ACTH-secreting tumor {Cushing syndrome). \n2. Synthetic glucocartlcalds-The mechanism of action of \nthese agents is identical with that of cortisol. A large number of syn\u00ad\nthetic glucocorticoids are available for use; p.reclnisone and its active \nmetabolite, prednisolone, deumethasone, and triamcinolone are \nrepresentative. Their properties (compared with cortisol) include \nlonger half-life and duration of action, reduced salt-retaining \neffect, and better penetration of lipid barriers for topical activity \n(Table 39-1). \nSpecial glucocorticoids have been devdoped for use in asthma \n(see Chapter 20) and other conditions in which good surface activ\u00ad\nity on mucous membranes or skin is needed and systemic effects are \nto be avoided. Bedomethasone and budc:sonide readily penetrate \nthe airway mucosa but have very short half-lives after they enter \nthe blood, so that systemic effects and toxicity are greatly reduced. \nFluticuone is another inhaled steroid with a longer half-life. \nD. Clinical Uses \n1. Adrenal disorders-Glucoconicoids are essential to preserve \nlife in patients with chronic adrenal cortical insufficiency (Addison \ndisease) and are necessary in acute adrenal insufficiency associated \nwith life-threatening shock, infection, or trauma. Glucocorticoids \nare also used in certain types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, \nin which synthesis of abnormal forms of corticosteroids is stimu\u00ad\nlated by ACTH. In these conditions, administration of a potent \nsynthetic glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH secretion sufficiently \nto reduce the synthesis of the abnormal steroids. \n2. Nonadrenal disorders-Many disorders respond to cortico\u00ad\nsteroid therapy. Some of these are inflammatory or immunologic \nin nature (eg, asthma, organ transplant rejection, collagen diseases, \nrheumatic disorders). Other applications include the treatment of \nhematopoietic cancers, neurologic disorders, chemotherapy-induced \nvomiting, hypercalcemia, and mountain sickness. Betamethasone, \na glucocorticoid with a low degree of protein binding, is given to \npregnant women in premature labor to hasten maturation of the \nfetal lungs. The degree of benefit differs considerably in different \ndisorders, and the toxicity of corticosteroids given chronically limits \ntheir use. \nE. Toxicity \nShort-term ( <2 weeks) therapy is well tolerated. Longer courses \ncan cause serious toxicity. Most of the toxic effects of the glu\u00ad\ncocorticoids are predictable from the effects already described. \nSome are life threatening and include metabolic effects (growth \ninhibition, diabetes, muscle wasting, osteoporosis), salt retention, \nreduced wound healing, and psychosis. Methods for minimizing \nthese toxicities include local application (eg, aerosols of sdected \nsteroids for asthma), alternate-day therapy (to reduce pituitary \nsuppression), and tapering the dose soon after achieving a thera\u00ad\npeutic response. To avoid adrenal insufficiency in patients who are receiving long-term therapy, additional \"stress doses\" may need \nto be given during serious illness or before major surgery because \nall endogenous production is suppressed. Patients who arc being \nwithdrawn from glucocorticoids after prolonged use should have \ntheir doses tapered slowly, over the course of several months, to \nallow recovery of normal adrenal function. \nMINERALOCORTICOIDS \nA. Aldosterone \nThe major natural mincralocorticoid in humans is aldosteronc, \nwhich is discussed in connection with hypertension {see Chapter 11) \nand with control of its secretion by angiotensin II (see Chapter 17). \nThe secretion of aldostcronc is regulated by ACTH and by the \nrenin-angiotensin system and is very important in the regulation \nof blood volume and blood pressure (see Figure 6-4). Aldosterone \nhas a short half-life and little glucocorticoid activity (Table 39-1). \nIts mechanism of action is the same as that of the glucocorticoids, \nand results in increased sodium and volume retention. \nB. Other Mineralocorticoids \nOther mineralocorticoids include deoxycorticosterone, the natu~ \nrally occurring precursor of aldosterone, and ftudrocortisone, a \nsynthetic steroid that also has significant glucocorticoid activity. \nBecause of its long duration of action (Table 39-1), fludrocorti~ \nsone is favored for replacement therapy after adrenalectomy and \nin other conditions in which mineralocorticoid therapy is needed. \nCORTICOSTEROID ANTAGONISTS \nA. Receptor Antagonists \nSpironolact.one and eplerenone, antagonists of aldosterone at its \nreceptor, are discussed in connection with the diuretics (see \nChapter 15). Mifepristone (RU.-486) is a competitive inhibitor of \nglucocorticoid receptors as well as progesterone receptors (see \nChapter 40) and has been used in the treatment of Cushing \nsyndrome. \nSKILL KEEPER: ALDOSTERONE ANTAGO\u00ad\nNISTS AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE \n(SEE CHAPTERS 13 AND 15) \nClinical trials have shown that the aldosterone receptor \nantagonists spironolaaone and eplerenone decrease mor\u00ad\nbidity and mortality in patients who are taking other stan\u00ad\ndard therapies. \n1. Why is aldosterone elevated in patients with congestive \nheart failure? \n2. How does the increase in aldosterone contribute to the \nsigns and symptoms of heart failure? \n3. What happens to serum potassium concentrations in \npatients who are treated with aldosterone antagonists? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter."

The most impor\u00ad\ntant of these drugs are ketoc:onazole, aminoglutethimicle, metyr\u00ad\naponc, and ctomidate. Kctoconazole (an antifungal drug) inhibits \nthe cytochrome P450 enzymes necessary for the synthesis of all \nsteroids and is used in a number of conditions in which reduced \nsteroid levds arc desirable (eg, adrenal carcinoma, hirsutism, breast \nand prostate cancer). Aminoglutethimidc blocks the conversion of \ncholesterol to pregncnolone (Figure 39-2) and also inhibits synthe\u00ad\nsis of all hormonally active steroids. It can be used in conjunction \nwith other drugs for treatment of steroid-producing adrcnocortical \ncancer. Metyrapone inhibits the normal synthesis of cortisol but \nnot that of cortisol precursors; the drug can be used in diagnostic \ntests of adrenal function. Etomidatc (a general anesthetic) inhibits \n11~-hydroxylase and can be used in Cushing syndrome. \nQUESTIONS \n1.

Glucocorticoids inhibit the production of both leukotrienes \nand prostaglandins via inhibition of phospholipase A2\u2022 This \nis a key component of their anti-inflammatory action. The \nanswer is C. \n2. One of the adverse metabolic effects of long-term glucocorti\u00ad\ncoid therapy is a net loss of bone, which can result in osteopo\u00ad\nrosis. The answer is D. \n3. Ketoconazole inhibits many types of cytochrome P450 \nenzymes. It can be used to reduce the unregulated overproduc\u00ad\ntion of corticosteroids by adrenal tumors. The answer is D. \n4. A 21cx-hydroxylase deficiency prevents normal synthesis of \ncortisol and aldosterone, and causes accumulation of cortisol \nprecursors (Figure 39-2). The hypothalamic-pituitary system \nresponds to the abnormally low levels of cortisol by increasing \nACTH rdease. High levds of ACTH induce adrenal hyper\u00ad\nplasia and excess production of adrenal androgens, which can \ncause virilization of females and prepuberral males. Gluco\u00ad\ncorticoid is administered to replace the missing mineralo\u00ad\ncorticoid and glucocorticoid activity and to suppress ACTH \nrdease, which removes the stimulus for excess adrenal andro\u00ad\ngen production. The answer is E. \nS. Activated steroid hormone receptors mediate their effects on \ngene expression by binding to hormone response elements, \nwhich are short sequences of DNA located near steroid\u00ad\nregulated genes. The answer is D. \n6. Glucocorticoids are used in combination with other anti\u00ad\nemetics to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomit\u00ad\ning, which are commonly associated with anticancer drugs. \nThe answer is A. \n7. Exogenous glucocorticoids act at the hypothalamus and pitu\u00ad\nitary to suppress the production of corticotropin-rdeasing \nhormone (CRH) and ACTH. As a result, adrenal production of endogenous corticosteroids is suppressed. On discontinu\u00ad\nance, the recovery of normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \nfunction occurs slowly. Glucocorticoid doses must be tapered \nslowly, over several months, to prevent adrenal insufficiency. \nThe answer is E. \n8. Of the drugs listed, cortisol has the lowest and dexametha\u00ad\nsone the highest anti-inflammatory activity. The answer is B. \n9. In acute adrenal insufficiency, there is loss of salt and water \nthat is primarily due to reduced production of aldosterone. \nThe loss of salt and water can lead to dehydration. A rational \ncombination of drugs should include agents with comple\u00ad\nmentary effects (ie, a glucocorticoid and a mineralocorticoid). \nThe combination with these characteristics is cortisol and \nfludrocortisone. (Note that although fludrocortisone may \nhave sufficient glucocorticoid activity for a patient with mild \ndisease, a patient in severe acute adrenal insufficiency needs a \nfull glucocorticoid such as cortisol.) The answer is B. \n10. Mifepristone is a competitive antagonist of glucocorticoid \nand progesterone receptors. Ketoconazole and aminogluteth\u00ad\nimide also antagonize corticosteroids; however, they act by \ninhibiting steroid hormone synthesis. The answer is D. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: ALDOSTERONE \nANTAGONISTS AND CONGESTIVE HEART \nFAILURE (SEE CHAPTERS 13AND15) \n1. The reduction in cardiac output associated with heart \nfailure decreases the effective arterial blood volume and \nrenal blood flow. Decreased pressure in renal arterioles \nand increased sympathetic neural activity both stimulate \nrenin release, which increases production of anglotensin II. \nAngiotensin II is a powerful stimulus of aldosterone \nsecretion. \n2. Acting through nuclear receptors in the epithelial cells that \nline renal collecting tubules, aldosterone promotes renal \nuptake of salt and water. This retention of salt and water \nexacerbates the peripheral and pulmonary edema associ\u00ad\nated with congestive heart failure and further overloads \nthe weakened heart. Jn addition to these renal effects, \naldosterone is also Implicated in myocardial and vascular \nfibrosis and baroreceptor dysfunction. \n3. The aldosterone antagonists ore also known as 'potassium\u00ad\nsporing diuretics' because, unlike other diuretics, they \ndo not promote renal excretion of potassium. Because \nthe excretion of potassium in the renal tubule is linked to \nthe reuptake of sodium, the reduction in sodium uptake \ncaused by spironolactone and eplerenone results in potas\u00ad\nsium retention and an increase in serum potassium."

Because of \ntheir extensive use as contraceptives and replacement therapy, \nmany synthetic estrogens and progestins have been produced. \nRelated agents include synthesis inhibitors, receptor antagonists, \nand some drugs with mixed effects (ie, agonist effects in some \ntissues and antagonist effects in other tissues}. Mixed agonists with estrogenic effects are called sdective estrogen receptor \nmodulators (SERMs). Synthetic androgens, including those \nwith anabolic activity, are also available for clinical use. A diverse \ngroup of drugs with antiandrogenic effects is used in the treat\u00ad\nment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in men \nand androgen excess in women.

If the ovum \nis not fertilized and implanted, the corpus luteum degenerates; the \nuterine endometrium, which has proliferated under the stimulation of estrogen and progesterone, is shed as part of the menstrual flow, \nand the cycle repeats. The mechanism of action of both estrogen and \nprogesterone involves entry into cells, binding to cytosolic receptors, \nand translocarion of the receptor-hormone dimer into the nucleus, \nwhere it modulates gene expression {see Figure 39-1). \nA. Estrogens \nThe major ovarian estrogen in women is estradiol. Estradiol has \nlow oral bioavailability but is available in a micronized form for \noral use.

Synthetic estro\u00ad\ngens with high bioavailability (eg, cthinyl estradiol, mestranol) \nare used in hormonal contraceptives. \n1. Effects-Estrogen is essential for normal female reproduc\u00ad\ntive development. It is responsible for the growth of the genital \nstructures (vagina, uterus, and uterine tubes) during childhood \nand for the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics and the \ngrowth spurt associated with puberty. Estrogen has many meta\u00ad\nbolic effects: It modifies serum protein levels and reduces bone \nresorption. It enhances the coagulability of blood and increases \nplasma triglyceride levels while reducing low-density lipoprotein \n(LDL) cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \ncholesterol. Continuous administration of estrogen, especially in \ncombination with a progestin, inhibits the secretion of gonadotro\u00ad\npins from the anterior pituitary (Figure 40-1). \n2. Clinical use-Estrogens are used in the treatment of hypogo\u00ad\nnadism in young females (Table 40-1). Another use is as HRT in \nwomen with estrogen deficiency resulting from premature ovarian \nfailure, menopause, or surgical removal of the ovaries. HRT ame\u00ad\nliorates hot flushes and atrophic changes in the urogenital tract. \nIt is also effective in preventing bone loss and osteoporosis. The \nestrogens are components of hormonal contraceptives (see later \ndiscussion). \n3. Toxicity-In hypogonadal girls, the dosage of estrogen must \nbe adjusted carefully to prevent premature closure of the epiphyses \nof the long bones and short stature. When used as HRT, estrogen \nincreases the risk of endometrial cancer; this effect is prevented by \ncombining the estrogen with a progestin. Estrogen use by post\u00ad\nmenopausal women is associated with a small increase in the risk \nof breast cancer and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke). Dose-dependent toxicity includes nausea, breast tender\u00ad\nness, increased risk of migraine headache, thromboembolic events \n(eg, deep vein thrombosis), gallbladder disease, hypertriglyceride\u00ad\nmia, and hypertension. Because significant amounts of estrogens \nand their active metabolites arc excreted in the bile and reabsorbed \nfrom the intestine, orally administered estrogens will have a high \nratio of hepatic to peripheral effects. The hepatic effects include \nincreased synthesis of dotting factors. The hepatic effects of estro\u00ad\ngen can be minimized by routes that avoid first-pass liver exposure, \nthat is, vaginal, transdermal , or injection. \nDiethylstilbestrol (DES), a nonsteroidal estrogenic compound, \nis associated with infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and vaginal adeno\u00ad\ncarcinoma in the daughters of women who were treated with the \ndrug during pregnancy in a misguided attempt to prevent recur\u00ad\nrent spontaneous abortion. These effects appear to be restricted to \nDES because there is no evidence that the estrogens and progestins \nin hormonal contraceptives have similar effects or other terato\u00ad\ngenic effects. \nB. Progestins \nProgesterone is the major progestin in humans. A micronized \nform is used orally fur HRT, and progesterone-containing vaginal \ncreams are also available. Synthetic progestins (eg, mcdroxypro\u00ad\ngesterone) have improved oral bioavailability. The 19-nortestos\u00ad\nterone compounds differ primarily in their degree of androgenic \neffects. Older drugs (eg, L-norgcstrd. and noretbindrone) are \nmore androgenic than the newer progestins (eg, norgestimate, \ndesogestre.l). \n1. Effects-Progesterone induces secretory changes in the endo\u00ad\nmetrium and is required for the maintenance of pregnancy. The \nother progestins named above also stabilize the endometrium but \ndo not support pregnancy. Progestins do not significantly affect \nplasma proteins, but they do affect carbohydrate metabolism and \nstimulate the deposition of fat. High doses suppress gonadotropin \nsecretion and often cause anovulation in women. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

(Reproduced with pennission from Katzung BG, Vanderah \nTW: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 15th ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill; \n2021.) \n2. Clinical use-Progestins are used as contraceptives, either \nalone or in combination with an estrogen. They are used in com\u00ad\nbination with an estrogen in HRT to prevent estrogen-induced \nendometrial cancer, though this combination may increase the risk \nof breast cancer. Progesterone is used in assisted reproductive tech\u00ad\nnology methods to promote and maintain pregnancy. \n3. Toxicity-The toxicity of progestins is low. However, they \nmay increase blood pressure and decrease HDL. Long-term use of CHAPTER 40 Gonadal Hormones & Inhibitors 343 \nhigh doses in premenopausal women is associated with a reversible \ndecrease in bone density (a secondary effect of ovarian suppres\u00ad\nsion and decreased ovarian production of estrogen) and delayed \nresumption of ovulation after termination of therapy. \nC. Hormonal Contraceptives \nHormonal contraceptives contain either a combination of an \nestrogen and a progestin or a progestin alone. Hormonal contra\u00ad\nceptives are available in a variety of preparations, including oral \npills, long-acting injections, subcutaneous implants, transdermal \npatches, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) (Table \n40-1). Three types of oral contraceptives for women are avail\u00ad\nable in the United States: combination estrogen-progestin tablets \nthat are taken in constant dosage throughout the menstrual cycle \n(monophasic preparations); combination preparations (biphasic, \ntriphasic, and quadriphasic) in which the progestin or estrogen \ndosage, or both, changes during the month (to more closely mimic \nhormonal changes in a menstrual cycle); and progestin-only \npreparations. Newer options include once-a-year periods or four\u00ad\nperiods-a-year regimens. \nThe postcoital contraceptives (also known as \"emergency \ncontraception\") prevent pregnancy if administered within 72 h \nafter unprotected intercourse. Oral preparations containing a \nprogestin (L-norgestrel) alone, estrogen alone, or the combination \nof an estrogen and a progestin are effective. The progestin-only \npreparation causes fewer side effects than the estrogen-containing \npreparations. \n1. Mechanism ol action-The combination hormonal contra\u00ad\nceptives have several actions, including inhibition of ovulation (the \nprimary action) and effects on the cervical mucus glands, uterine \ntubes, and endometrium that decrease the likelihood of fertiliza\u00ad\ntion and implantation. Progestin-only agents do not always inhibit \novulation and instead act through the other mechanisms listed. \nThe mechanisms of action of postcoital contraceptives are not well \nunderstood. When administered before the LH surge, they inhibit \novulation. They also affect cervical mucus, tubal function, and the \nendometrial lining. \n2. Other din/cal uses and beneficial effects-Combination \nhormonal contraceptives are used in young women with primary \nhypogonadism to prevent estrogen deficiency. Combinations of hor\u00ad\nmonal contraceptives and progestins are used to treat acne, hirsutism, \ndysmenorrhea, and endometriosis. Users of combination hor\u00ad\nmonal contraceptives have reduced risks of ovarian cysts, ovarian \nand endometrial cancer, benign breast disease, and pelvic inflam\u00ad\nmatory disease as well as a lower incidence of ectopic pregnancy, \niron deficiency anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. \n3. Toxicity-The incidence of dose-dependent toxicity has fallen \nsince the introduction of the low-dose (eg, less than 50 mcg of \nestrogen) combined oral contraceptives. \na. Thromboembolism-The major toxic effects of the com\u00ad\nbined hormonal contraceptives relate to the action of the estrogenic \ncomponent on blood coagulation. There is a well-documented"

Other toxicities- The low-dose combined oral and progestin\u00ad\nonly contraceptives cause significant breakthrough bleeding, espe\u00ad\ncially during the first few months of therapy. Other toxicities of the \nhormonal contraceptives include nausea, breast tenderness, head\u00ad\nache, skin pigmentation, and depression. Preparations containing \nolder, more androgenic progestins can cause weight gain, acne, and \nhirsutism. The high dose of estrogen in estrogen-containing postco\u00ad\nital contraceptives is associated with significant nausea.

            "Text": "ANTI ESTROGENS & ANTI PROGESTI NS \nA. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators \nSelective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are mixed estro\u00ad\ngen agonists that have estrogen agonist effects in some tissues and \nact as partial agonists or antagonists of estrogen in other tissues. \nThis may be due to recruitment of different regulatory proteins \nand/or estrogen receptor (ER) dimers (eg, ERa-ERa, ERa-ER~, \nE~-ER~). \nJ. Tamoxlfen- T amoxifen is an SERM that is effective in the \ntreatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer, where it acts as an \nantagonist to prevent receptor activation by endogenous estrogens \n(Figure 40-1). Prophylactic use of tamoxifen reduces the inci\u00ad\ndence of breast cancer in women who are at very high risk. As an \nagonist of endometrial receptors, tamoxifen promotes endometrial \nhyperplasia and increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The drug \nalso causes hot flushes (an antagonist effect) and increases the risk \nof venous thrombosis (an agonist effect). Tamoxifen has more ago\u00ad\nnist than antagonist action on bone and thus prevents osteoporosis \nin postmenopausal women. Toremifenc is structurally rdated to \ntamoxifen and has similar properties, indications, and toxicity. \n2. Raloxifene-Raloxifene, approved for prevention and treat\u00ad\nment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, has a partial \nagonist effect on bone. Like tamoxifen, raloxifene has antagonist \neffects in breast tissue and reduces the incidence of breast cancer in \nwomen who are at very high risk. Unlike tamoxifen, the drug has no \nestrogenic effects on endomctrial tissue. Adverse effects include hot \nflushes (an antagonist effect) and an increased risk of venous throm\u00ad\nbosis (an agonist effect). BazedoDfen.c, a newer SERM, is approved \nfor treatment of menopausal symptoms and prophylaxis of post\u00ad\nmenopausal osteoporosis in combination with conjugated estrogens. \n3. Clomlphene-Clomiphene is a partial agonist at estrogen \nreceptors. It is used to induce ovulation in anovulatory women \nwho wish to become pregnant. By selectively blocking estrogen \nreceptors in the pituitary, clomiphene reduces negative feedback \nand increases FSH and LH output. The increase in gonadotropins \nstimulates ovulation. \nB. Pure Estrogen Receptor Antagonists \nFulvestrant is a pure estrogen receptor antagonist (in all tissues). \nIt is used in the treatment of women with breast cancer resistant \nto tamoxifen. \nC. Synthesis Inhibitors \nJ. Aromatase inhibitors-Anasuozolc and related compounds \n(eg, lctrozole) are nonsteroidal competitive inhibitors of aroma\u00ad\ntase, the enzyme required for the last step in estrogen synthesis. \nEumestane is an irreversible aromatase inhibitor. These drugs are \nused in the treatment of breast cancer. \n2. Danazol-Danazol inhibits several cytochrome P450 enzymes \ninvolved in gonadal steroid synthesis and is a weak partial agonist CHAPTER 40 Gonadal Hormones & Inhibitors 345 \nof progestin, androgen, and glucocorticoid receptors. The drug is \nsometimes used in the treatment of endometriosis and flbrocystic \ndisease of the breast. \nD. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogs and \nAntagonists \nAs discussed in Chapter 37, the continuous administration of \ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (eg, leuprolide) \nsuppresses gonadotropin secretion and thereby inhibits ovarian \nproduction of estrogens and progesterone. The GnRH agonists \nare used in combination with other agents in controlled ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see Chapter 37) and are also used for treatment \nof precocious puberty in children and short-term (<6 mo} treat\u00ad\nment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women. Treatment \nbeyond 6 mo in premenopausal women can result in decreased \nbone density. The GnRH receptor antagonists ganirelix and \ncetrorelix are used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (see \nChapter 3 7). \nE. Antiprogestins \nMifepristone (RU 486) is an orally active steroid antagonist of \nprogesterone and glucocorticoids (see Chapter 39). Its major use is \nas an abortifacient in early pregnancy (up to 49 da}'li after the last \nmenstrual period). The combination of mifepristone and the pros\u00ad\ntaglandin E analog misoprostol (see Chapters 18 and 59) achieves \na complete abortion in over 95% of early pregnancies. The most \ncommon complication is failure to induce a complete abortion. \nSide effects, which are primarily due to the misoprostol, include \nnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea plus the cramping and bleeding \nassociated with passing the pregnancy. Rarely, patients who used \nmifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion have experi\u00ad\nenced serious infection, sepsis, and even death due to unusual \ninfection (eg, C/ostridium sordeltiz). \nANDROGENS \nTestosterone and related androgens are produced in the testis, the \nadrenal, and, to a small extent, the ovary. Testosterone is synthe\u00ad\nsized from progesterone and debydroepiandrosterone (DHEA}. In \nthe plasma, testosterone is partly bound to sex hormone-binding \nglobulin (SHBG), a transport protein. The hormone is converted \nin several organs (eg, prostate) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT}, \nwhich is the active hormone in those tissues. Because of rapid \nhepatic metabolism, testosterone given orally has little effect. \nIt may be given by injection in the form of long-acting esters \nor transdermal patch. Orally active variants are also available \n(Table 40-1). \nMany androgens have been synthesized in an effort to \nincrease the anabolic effect (see Effects, discussed later) without \nincreasing androgenic action. Ou.ndrolonc and stanozolol are \nexamples of drugs that, in laboratory testing, have an increased \nratio of anabolic-androgenic action. However, all the so-called \nanabolic steroids have full androgenic agonist effects when used \nin humans."

            "Text": "346 PART VII Endocrine Drugs \nA. Mechanism of Action \nLike other steroid hormones, androgens enter cells and bind to \ncytosolic receptors. The hormone-receptor complex enters the \nnucleus and modulates the expression of target genes. \nB.Effects \nTestosterone is necessary for normal development of the male fetus \nand infant and is responsible for the major changes in the male at \npuberty (growth of penis, larynx, and skeleton; dcvdopmcnt of \nfacial, pubic, and axillary hair; darkening of skin; enlargement of \nmuscle mass). After puberty, testosterone acts to maintain second\u00ad\nary sex characteristics, fertility, and libido. It also acts on hair cdls \nto cause malo-pattcrn baldness. \nThe major effect of androgenic hormones, in addition to dcvd\u00ad\nopmcnt and maintenance of normal male characteristics, is an ana\u00ad\nbolic action that involves increased muscle size and strength and \nincreased red blood cell production. Excretion of urea nitrogen is \nreduced, and nitrogen balance becomes more positive. Testoster \u00ad\none also helps maintain normal bone density. \nC. Cllnlcal Use \nThe primary clinical use of the androgens is for replacement ther\u00ad\napy in hypogonadism (Table 40-1). Androgens have also been \nused to stimulate red blood cell production in certain anemias \nand to promote weight gain in patients with wasting syndromes \n(cg, AIDS patients). The anabolic effects have been exploited illic\u00ad\nitly by athletes to increase muscle bulk and strength and perhaps \nenhance athletic performance. \nD.Toxiclty \nUse of androgens by females results in virilization (hirsutism , \nenlarged clitoris, deepened voice) and menstrual irregular\u00ad\nity. In women who arc pregnant with a female fetus, exogenous \nandrogens can cause virilization of the fetus's external genitalia. \nParadoxically, excessive doses in men can result in feminization \n(gynccomastia, testicular shrinkage, infertility) as a result of feed\u00ad\nback inhibition of the pituitary and conversion of the exogenous \nandrogens to estrogens. In both sexes, high doses of anabolic ste\u00ad\nroids can cause cholestatlc jaundice, elevation of liver enzyme lev\u00ad\nels, and possibly hcpatoccllular carcinoma. \nANTIANDROGENS \nReduction of androgen effects is an important mode of therapy for \nboth benign and malignant prostate disease, precocious puberty, \nhair loss, and hirsutism. Drugs arc available that act at different \nsites in the androgen pathway (Figure 40-2). \nA. Racaptor Inhibitors \nFlutamidc and rdatcd drugs (eg, bicalutarnidc, nilutamidc, \nand cnzalutamidc) arc nonstcroidal competitive antagonists of \nandrogen receptors.

            "Text": "B. Sa-Reductase Inhibitors \nTestosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5a-reductase. \nSome tissues, most notably prostate cells and hair follicles, depend \non DHT rather than testosterone for androgenic stimulation. This \nenzyme is inhibited by finuteride, a drug used to treat benign \nprostatic hyperplasia and, at a lower dose, to prevent hair loss in \nmen. Because the drug does not interfere with the action of tes\u00ad\ntosterone, it is less likely than other antiandrogens to cause impo\u00ad\ntence, infertility, and loss of libido. Dutasteride is a 5a-reductase \ninhibitor with a much longer half-life than that of finastcridc. \nC. Gonadotropln-Releaslng Hormone Analogs and \nAntagonists \nSuppression of gonadotropin secretion, especially LH, reduces the \nproduction of testosterone. This can be effectively accomplished \nwith long-acting depot preparations ofleuprolide or similar GnRH \nagonists (see Chapter 37). These analogs are used in prostatic car\u00ad\ncinoma. During the first week of therapy, an androgen receptor \nantagonist (eg, flutamide) is added to prevent the tumor flare \nthat can result from the surge in testosterone synthesis caused by \nthe initial agonistic action of the GnRH agonist. Within several \nweeks, testosterone production falls to low levels. As discussed in \nChapter 37, the GnRH receptor antagonists abarelix and degardix \nare approved for advanced prostate cancer. \nD. Combined Hormonal Contraceptives \nCombined hormonal contraceptives arc used in women with \nandrogen-induced hirsutism. The estrogen in the contraceptive \nacts in the liver to increase the production of SHBG, which in turn \nreduces the concentration of the free androgen in the blood that \nis causing the male-pattern hair growth characteristic of hirsutism. \nE. Inhibitors ofSteroid Synthesis \nKctoconazole, an antifungal drug (see Chapter 48), inhibits \ngonadal and adrenal steroid synthesis. The drug has been used to \nsuppress adrenal steroid synthesis in patients with steroid-responsive \nmetastatic prostate cancer. \nQUESTIONS \n1. A teenager seeks postcoital contraception.

When combined with a prostaglandin, it \nis also an effective abortifacient. The answer is D. \n2. Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives increase the \nrisk of episodes of migraine headache. The answer is D. \n3. In men, large doses of anabolic steroids are associated with \nliver impairment, including cholestasis and elevation of \nserum concentrations of transaminases. The answer is B. \n4. Tamoxifen has proved useful in adjunctive therapy of breast \ncancer; the drug decreases the rate of recurrence of cancer. \nThe answer is E. \n5. Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist used in the treatment of men \nwith prostate cancer. Continuous use leads to downregula\u00ad\ntion of testosterone production. Initially, the agonist action \nincreases testosterone, causing a tumor flare. To prevent this, \nflutamide, a competitive antagonist of the androgen recep\u00ad\ntor, is added until downregulation of testosterone is complete. \nThe answer is C. \n6. In endometriosis, suppression of ovarian function and produc\u00ad\ntion of gonadal steroids are useful. Intramuscular injection of relatively large doses of medroxyprogesterone provides 3 months \nof an ovarian suppressive effect because ofinhibition of pituitary \nproduction of gonadotropins. The answer is B. \n7. DES is a nonsteroidal estrogen agonise. Several decades ago, \nmisguided use of the drug in pregnant women appears to have \nresulted in fetal damage that predisposed female offspring to \ninfertility and a rare form of vaginal cancer. For this reason, \nthe drug should be avoided in pregnant women. Other estro\u00ad\ngenic drugs do not appear to have these effects. Although \nestrogens do increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis, this is \nnot the reason why DES should be avoided. The answer is C. \n8. SERMs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene exhibit tissue\u00ad\nspecific estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. The answer is A. \n9. Finasteride inhibits 5a-reductase, the enzyme that converts \ntestosterone to DHT, the principal androgen in androgen\u00ad\nsensitive hair follicles. The answer is E. \n10. Conjugated estrogens and raloxifene both improve hone min\u00ad\neral density and protect against osteoporosis. The 2 advan\u00ad\ntages of raloxifene over full estrogen receptor agonists are \nthat raloxifene has antagonist effects in breast tissue and lacks \nan agonistic effect in endometrium. If a patient's uterus was \nremoved by surgery, the difference in the endometrial effect \nis moot. In patients with a strong family history of breast \ncancer, raloxifene may he a better choice than a full estrogen \nagonist because it will not further increase the woman's risk of \nbreast cancer and may even lower her risk. The answer is D. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: CYTOCHROME \nP450 AND HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES \n(SEE CHAPTERS 4 AND 62) \n1. Gonadal steroids and their derivatives are metabolized \nprimarily by the cytochrome P450 3M (CYP3A4) family of \nenzymes. Inducers of CYP3A4 include barbiturates, carba\u00ad\nmazepine, corticosteroids, griseofulvin, phenytoin, piogli\u00ad\ntazone, rifampin, and rifabutin. The potential reduction in \ncontraceptive efficacy of hormonal contraceptives by car\u00ad\nbamazepine and phenytoin are of particular importance \nbecause these drugs are known teratogens. St. John's wort \nan unregulated herbal product, contains an ingredient \nthat induces CYP3M enzymes and can reduce the efficacy \nof hormonal contraceptives. \n2. To prevent an unwanted pregnancy, it would be advis\u00ad\nable to use a combined hormonal contraceptive pill with \na higher dose of estrogen (eg, a formulation containing \n50 mcg of ethinyl estradioO.

Although type 2 diabetes usually has its onset in adult\u00ad\nhood, the incidence in children and adolescents is rising dramatically, \nin parallel with the increase in obesity in this population. \nThe clinical history and course of these two forms differ con\u00ad\nsiderably, but treatment in both cases requires careful attention to \ndiet, fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations, and \nserum concentrations of hemoglobin A10, a glycosylated hemoglo\u00ad\nbin that serves as a marker of chronic glycemia. Type 1 diabetes \nrequires treatment with insulin. The early stages of type 2 diabe\u00ad\ntes usually can be controlled with noninsulin antidiabetic drugs. \nHowever, patients in the later stages of type 2 diabetes often \nrequire the addition of insulin to their drug regimen. \nINSULIN \nA. Physiology \nInsulin is synthesired as the prohormone proinsulin, an 86-amino-acid \nsingle-chain polypeptide. Cleavage of proinsulin and cross-linking \nresult in the 2-chain 51-peptide insulin molecule and a 31-amino\u00ad\nacid residual C-peptide. Proinsulin may have mild hypoglycemic \naction; C-peptide has no known physiologic function. \nB. Effects \nInsulin has imponant effects on almost every tissue of the body. \nThe insulin receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase. When \nactivated, it phosphorylates itself and a variety of intracellular pro\u00ad\nteins. The major target organs for insulin action include: \n7. Liver-Insulin increases the storage of glucose as glycogen in \nthe liver. This involves the insertion of additional GLUT2 glucose \ntranspon molecules in cell plasma membranes; increased synthesis \nof the enzymes pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, and glu\u00ad\ncokinase; and suppression of several other enzymes. Insulin also \ndecreases protein catabolism and increases triglyceride synthesis \nand VLDL formation. \n2. Skeletal muscle-Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis and \nprotein synthesis. Glucose transport into muscle cells is facilitated \nby insertion ofGLUT4 transponers into cell plasma membranes. 3. Adipose tissue-Insulin facilitates triglyceride storage by acti\u00ad\nvating plasma lipoprotein lipase, increasing glucose transport into \ncells via GLUT 4 transporters, and suppressing intracellular lipolysis. \nC. Pharmaceutlcal lnsulln Preparations \nHuman insulin is manufactured by bacterial recombinant DNA \ntechnology. The available forms provide four rates of onset and \ndurations of effect that range from rapid-acting to long-acting \n(Figure 41-1). The goals of insulin therapy are to control both \nbasal and postprandial (after a meal) glucose levels while minimiz\u00ad\ning the risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin formulations with different \nrates of onset and effect are often combined to achieve these goals. \n1. Rapid-acting- Three insulin analogs (insulin lispro, insulin \naspart, and insulin glulisine) have rapid onsets and early peaks \nof activity (Figure 41-1) that permit control of postprandial glu\u00ad\ncose levels. The three rapid-acting insulins have small alterations \nin their primary amino acid sequences that speed their entry into \nthe circulation without affecting their interaction with the insulin \nreceptor. The rapid-acting insulins are injected immediately before \na meal and are the preferred insulin for continuous subcutaneous \ninfusion devices. They also can be used for emergency treatment \nof uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis. \n2. Short-acting-Regular insulin is used intravenously in \nemergencies (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis) or administered subcuta\u00ad\nneously in ordinary maintenance regimens, alone or mixed with \nintermediate- or long-acting preparations. Before the development \nof rapid-acting insulins, it was the primary form of insulin used \nfor controlling postprandial glucose concentrations, but it requires \nadministration 1 h or more before a meal. \n3. Intermediate-acting-Neutral protamine Hagedorn insu\u00ad\nlin (NPH insulin) is a combination of regular insulin, protamine \n(a highly basic protein also used to reverse the action of unfrac\u00ad\ntionated heparin, see Chapter 34) and zinc, that exhibits a delayed \nonset and peak of action (Figure 41-1). NPH insulin is often com\u00ad\nbined with regular and rapid-acting insulins."

Lon9-actln9-lnsulin glargine, insulin deternir, and insu\u00ad\nlin degludec are modifled forms of human insulin that provide \na peakless basal insulin level lasting more than 20 h, which helps \ncontrol basal glucose levels without producing hypoglycemia. \n5. Insulin delivery systems- The standard mode of insulin \ntherapy is subcutaneous injection with conventional disposable \nneedles and syringes. More convenient means of administration \nare also available, such as inhaled insulin. Portable pen-sized injec\u00ad\ntors are used to facilitate subcutaneous injection. Some contain \nreplaceable cartridges, whereas others are disposable. \nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices avoid the \nneed for multiple daily injections and provide flexibility in the \nscheduling of patients' daily activities. Programmable pumps \ndeliver a constant 24-h basal rate, and manual adjustments in the \nrate of delivery can be made to accommodate changes in insulin \nrequirements (eg, before meals or exercise). An artificial pancreas \nsystem that measures glucose and adjusts insulin pump delivery \nwas approved in 2017. \nD. Hazards of Insulin Use \nThe most common complication is hypoglycemia, resulting \nfrom excessive insulin effect. To prevent the brain damage that \nmay result from hypoglycemia, prompt administration of glucose \n(sugar or candy by mouth, glucose by vein) or of glucagon (by \nintramuscular injection) is essential. Patients with advanced renal \ndisease, the elderly, and children younger than 7 years are most \nsusceptible to the detrimental effects of hypoglycemia. \nThe most common form of insulin-induced immunologic \ncomplication is the formation of antibodies to insulin or noninsu\u00ad\nlin protein contaminants, which results in resistance to the action \nof the drug or allergic reactions. With the current use of recombi\u00ad\nnant human insulins, immunologic complications are uncommon. NONINSULIN ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS \nSeveral groups of antidiabetic drugs are used most commonly to \ntreat type 2 diabetes. These include (1) insulin secretagogues \n(Figure 41-2), (2) the biguanide metformin, (3) thiamlidinC\"\" \ndiones, (4) incretins, (5) a--glucosidase inhibitors (Figure 41-3), \nand (6) renal glucose reuptake inhibitors (Figure 41-3). The \ndurations of action of important members of these groups are \nlisted in Table 41-1. \nA. Insulin Secretagogues \n1. Mechanism and effec:t.s--Insulin secretagogues stimulate the \nrelease of endogenous insulin by promoting closure of potassium \nchannels in the pancreatic B-cell membrane (Figure 41-2). Chan\u00ad\nnel closure depolarizes the cell and triggers insulin release. Insulin \nsecretagogues are not effective in patients who lack functional pan\u00ad\ncreatic B cells (type 1 diabetes). \nMost insulin secretagogues are in the chemical class known as \nsulfonylureas. The second-generation sulfonylureas (glyburide, \nglipizide, glim.epiride) are considerably more potent and used \nmore commonly than the older agents (tolbutamide, cblorprop\u00b7 \namide, others). Repaglinide, a meglitinide, and nateglinide, a \nn-phenylalanine derivative, are also insulin secretagogues. Both \nhave a rapid onset and short duration of action that make them \nuseful for administration just before a meal to control postprandial \nglucose levels. \n2. Toxichies-The insulin secretagogues, especially those with a \nhigh potency (eg, glyburide and glipizide), can precipitate hypo\u00b7 \nglycemia, although the risk is less than that associated with the \ninsulins. The older sulfonylureas (tolbutamide and chlorprop\u00ad\namide) are extensively bound to serum proteins, and drugs that \ncompete for protein binding may enhance their hypoglycemic \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Other effects include stimulation of glucose uptake \nand glycolysis in peripheral tissues, slowing of glucose absorp\u00ad\ntion from the gastrointestinal tract, and reduction of plasma glu\u00ad\ncagon levels. The molecular mechanism of biguanide reduction \nin hepatic glucose production appears to involve activation of an \nadenosine monophosphate (AMP)-stimulated protein kinase. \nIn patients with insulin resistance, metformin reduces endog\u00ad\nenous insulin production presumably through enhanced insulin \nsensitivity. Because of this insulin-sparing effect and because it \ndoes not increase weight-unlike insulin, secretagogues, or the \nthiazolidinediones-metformin is increasingly the drug of first \nchoice in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent clinical \ntrials suggest that metformin also reduces the risk of onset of dia\u00ad\nbetes in high-risk patients. Metformin is also used to restore fertil\u00ad\nity in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) \nand evidence of insulin resistance. \n2. Toxicities-Unlike the sulfonylureas, the biguanides do not \ncause hypoglycemia. Their most common toxicity is gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal distress (nausea, diarrhea), and they can cause lactic acidosis, \nespecially in patients with renal or liver disease, alcoholism, or con\u00ad\nditions that predispose to tissue anoxia and lactic acid production \n(eg, chronic cardiopulmonary dysfunction). \nC. Thiazolidinediones \n1. Mechanism and effects-The thiazolidinediones, ro1igli\u00ad\ntuone, and pioglitamne, increase target tissue sensitivity to insulin by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma \nnuclear receptor (PPAR..iy receptor). This nuclear receptor regulates \nthe transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate \nand lipid metabolism. A primary effect of the thiawlidinediones is \nincreasing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue (Figure 41-3). \nThey also inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis and have effects on lipid \nmetabolism and the distribution of body fat. Thiawlidinediones \nreduce both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. They are used \nas monotherapy or in combination with insulin or other oral antidia\u00ad\nbetic drugs. Like metformin, the thiawlidinediones have been shown \nto reduce the risk of diabetes in high-risk patients. Pioglitawne also \nlowers triglycerides and increases HDL \n2. Toxicities-When these drugs are used alone, hypoglyce\u00ad\nmia is extremdy rare. Thiazolidinediones can cause fluid reten\u00ad\ntion, which presents as mild anemia and edema and may increase \nthe risk of heart failure. Recent data have linked rosiglitazone to \nincreased risk of myocardial infarction. The original thiazolidine\u00ad\ndione (troglitazone) was removed from the market in several coun\u00ad\ntries because of hepatotoxicity. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone \nhave not been linked to serious liver dysfunction but still require \nroutine monitoring of liver function. Female patients taking thia\u00ad\nzolidinediones appear to have an increased risk of bone fractures. \nPioglitazone and troglitazone induce cytochrome P450 activity \n(especially the CYP3A4 isozyme) and can reduce the serum con\u00ad\ncentrations of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes (eg, \noral contraceptives, cyclosporine). \nD. Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analogs \nGlucagon-like peptide-I (GLP-1) is a member of the incretin \nfamily of peptide hormones, which are released from endocrine \ncells in the epithelium of the bowel in response to food. The incre\u00ad\ntins augment glucose-stimulated insulin release from pancreatic \nB cells, retard gastric emptying, inhibit glucagon secretion, and \nproduce a feeling of satiety. The GLP-1 receptor is a G-protein\u00ad\ncoupled receptor (GPCR) that increases cAMP and also increases \nthe free intracellular concentration of calcium. \n.Exenatide, li.raglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide, long\u00ad\nacting injectable peptide analogs of GLP-1, are used in combi\u00ad\nnation with metformin or a sulfonylurea for treatment of type 2 \ndiabetes. Semaglutide is available as both subcutaneous and oral \nformulations. The major adverse effects are gastrointestinal distur\u00ad\nbances, particularly nausea during initial therapy, and hypoglyce\u00ad\nmia when exenatide is combined with a sulfonylurea. The drug has \nalso caused serious and sometimes fatal acute pancreatitis. \nE. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors \nSitagl.iptin, saugliptin, linagl.iptin, alogliptin, and vildagliptin \nare oral inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the enzyme \nthat degrades GLP-1 and other incretins. The prototype sitagliptin is \napproved for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination \nwith metformin or a thiazolidinedione. Like exenatide, sitagliptin pro\u00ad\nmotes insulin release, inhibits glucagon secretion, and has an anorexic \neffect. The most common adverse effects associated with sitagliptin \nare headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Amylin \ncontributes to glycemic control by activating high-affinity recep\u00ad\ntors involved in both glycemic control and osteogenesis. Pramlint\u00ad\nide suppresses glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, and works \nin the CNS to reduce appetite. After subcutaneous injection, it is \nrapidly absorbed and has a shon duration of action. It is used in \ncombination with insulin to control postprandial glucose levels. \nThe major adverse effects associated with pramlintide are hypogly\u00ad\ncemia and gastrointestinal disturbances. \nH. Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors \nThe sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) accounts for 90% \nof renal glucose reabsorption, and its inhibition causes glycosuria \nand lowers glucose levds in patients with type 2 diabetes. Inhi\u00ad\nbition of SGL T2 also has beneficial effects in hean failure (see \nChapter 13). The SGLT2 inhibitors anagliffozin, dapagliJlozin, \nempagliflozin, and ertugliflozin are approved for clinical use. \nThe main adverse effects are increased incidence of genital infec\u00ad\ntions and urinary tract infections. Increased amputation, reduced \nbone density, and increased risk of fractures have been reported \nfor canagliflozin. The osmotic diuresis can also cause intravascular \nvolume contraction and hypotension. Rare cases of diabetic keto\u00ad\nacidosis have been reported when these drugs were used (off label) \nin patients with type 1 diabetes. \nTREATMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS \nA. Type 1 Diabetes \nTherapy for type I diabetes involves dietary instruction, parenteral \ninsulin (a mixture of shoner and longer acting forms to maintain control of basal and postprandial glucose levels), and possibly \npramlintide for improved control of postprandial glucose levels, \nplus careful attention by the patient to factors that change insu\u00ad\nlin requirements: exercise, infections, other forms of stress, and \ndeviations from the regular diet. Large clinical studies indicate that \ntight control of blood sugar, by frequent blood sugar testing and \ninsulin injections, reduces the incidence of vascular complications, \nincluding renal and retinal damage. The risk of hypoglycemic \nreactions is increased in tight control regimens but not enough to \nobviate the benefits of better control. \nB. Type 2 Diabetes \nBecause type 2 diabetes is usually a progressive disease, therapy \nfor an individual patient generally escalates over time. It begins \nwith weight reduction and dietary control. Initial drug therapy \nusually is oral monotherapy with metformin. Although initial \nresponses to monotherapy usually are good, secondary failure \nwithin 5 years is common. Increasingly, noninsulin antidiabetic \nagents are being used in combination with each other or with \ninsulin to achieve better glycemic control and minimize toxicity. \nBecause type 2 diabetes often involves both insulin resistance and \ninadequate insulin production, it may be necessary to combine \nan agent that augments insulin's action (metformin, a thiazoli\u00ad\ndinedione, or an a-glucosidase inhibitor) with one that aug\u00ad\nments the insulin supplies (insulin secretagogue or insulin). \nLong-acting drugs (sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinedio\u00ad\nnes, exenatide, sitagliptin, some insulin formulations) help con\u00ad\ntrol both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levds, whereas \nshort-acting drugs (a-glucosidase inhibitors, repaglinide, pram\u00ad\nlintide, rapid-acting insulins), GLP-1 analogs, and DPP-4 inhib\u00ad\nitors primarily target postprandial levds. As is the case for type I \ndiabetes, clinical trials have shown that tight control of blood \nglucose in patients with type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of micro\u00ad\nvascular complications. \nSKILL KEEPER: DIABETES AND \nHYPERTENSION (SEE CHAPTER 11) \nDiabetes is linked to hypertension in several important ways. \nObesity predisposes patients to hypertension as well as to \ntype 2 diabetes, so many patients suffer from both diseases. \nBoth diseases damage the kidney and predispose patients to \ncoronary artery disease. A large clinical trial of patients with \ntype 2 diabetes suggests that poorly controlled hypertension \nexacerbates the microvascular disease caused by long\u00ad\nstanding diabetes. Because of these links, it is important to \nconsider the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. \n1. Identify the major drug groups used for chronic treatment \nof essential hypertension. \n2. Which of these drug groups have special implications for \nthe treatment of patients with diabetes? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter."

Chemistry, mechanism, and effects-Glucagon is a pro\u00ad\ntein hormone secreted by the A cells of the endocrine pancreas. \nBy activating G, protein-coupled receptors in the heart, liver, and \nsmooth muscle, glucagon increases heart rate and force of contrac\u00ad\ntion, increases hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and \nrelaxes smooth muscle. The smooth muscle effect is particularly \nmarked in the gut. \n2. Clinical uses-Glucagon is used to treat severe hypoglycemia \nin diabetics, but its hyperglycemic action requires intact hepatic \nglycogen stores. The drug is given intramuscularly or intrave\u00ad\nnously. In the management of severe P-blocker overdose, glucagon \nmay be the most effective method for stimulating the depressed \nheart because it increases cardiac cAMP without requiring access \nto Preceptors (see Chapter 58). \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1 and 2.

Oral antidiabetic agents (listed in Table 41-1) are inappropri\u00ad\nate in this patient because he has insulin-dependent diabetes. \nHe needs a rapid-acting insulin preparation that can be given \nintravenously (sec Figure 41-1). The answer is D. \n2. Because of the risk of brain damage, the most important \ncomplication of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia. The other \nchoices arc not common effects of insulin. The answer is B. \n3. Insulin regimens for tight control usually take the form of \nestablishing a basal levd of insulin with a small amount of \na long-acting preparation (cg, insulin degludcc) and supple\u00ad\nmenting the insulin levels, when called for by food intake, \nwith shon-acting insulin lispro. Less tight control may be \nachieved with two injections of intermediate-acting insulin \nper day. Because intake of glucose is mainly during the day, \nlong-acting insulins arc usually given in the morning, not at \nnight. The answer is D. \n4. Glipizidc is a second-generation sulfonylurca that promotes \ninsulin rdease by closing potassium channels in pancreatic \nB cdls. The answer is C. \nS. Insulin lowers serum glueo&e concentration in part by driving \nglucose into cells, particularly into muscle cells. The answer is C. \n6. Biguanidcs, especially the older drug phcnformin , have been \nassociated with lactic acidosis. Thus, metformin should be \navoided or used with extreme caution in patients with condi\u00ad\ntions that increase the risk of lactic acidosis, including acute \nethanol ingestion. The answer is D. \n7. To be absorbed, carbohydrates must be converted into mono\u00ad\nsaccharides by the action of a-glucosidase enzymes in the gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal tract. Acarbose inhibits a-glucosidasc and, when \npresent during digestion , delays the uptake of carbohydrates . \nThe answer is A.. 8. The PPAR-yreceptor belongs to a family of nuclear receptors. \nWhen activated, these receptors translocate to the nucleus, \nwhere they regulate the transcription of genes encoding pro\u00ad\nteins involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate and lipids. \nThe answer is D. \n9. The insulin sccrctagogue s, including the sulfonylurea gly\u00ad\nburidc, can cause hypoglycemia as a result of their ability to \nincrease serum insulin levels. The biguanides, thiazolidin\u00ad\ncdiones, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and canagliflozin are eug\u00ad\nlycemics that are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia when used \nalone. The answer is C. \n10. Glucagon acts through cardiac glucagon receptors to stimu\u00ad\nlate the rate and force of contraction of the heart. Because \nthis bypasses cardiac p adrenoccptors , glucagon is useful in \nthe treatment of ~blocker-induced cardiac depression. The \nanswer is D. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: DIABETES AND \nHYPERTENSION (SEE CHAPTER 11) \n1. The major antihypertenslve drug groups are (a) \n~adrenoceptor blockers; (b) a1-selective adrenoceptor \nblockers (eg, prazosin); (c) centrally acting sympathople\u00ad\ngics (eg, clonidlne or methyldopa); (d) calcium channel \nblockers (eg, diltlazem, nlfedlplne, veropamll) ; (e) angio\u00ad\ntensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors (eg, captopril); \n(f) angiotensin receptor antagonists (eg, losartan); and (g) \nthiazide diuretics. \n2. ACE inhibitors slow the progression of diabetic nephropa\u00ad\nthy and help stabilize renal function. Angiotensin receptor \nantagonists may have similar protective effects in patients \nwith diabetes. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers can, in theory, \nmask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients; \nhowever, many patients with diabetes and cardiovascu\u00ad\nlar disease are successfully treated with these drugs. A \nlarge dinical trial showed that control of hypertension \ndecreases diabetes-associated microvasculor disease. \nThis trial included many patients being maintained on \n13-adrenoceptor blockers.

In patients with conditions that impair vitamin D \nactivation (chronic kidney disease, liver disease, hypoparathyroid\u00ad\nism), an active form of vitamin D such as calcitriol is required. In \nthe treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with \nchronic kidney disease, calcitriol reduces PTH levels, corrects \nhypocalcemia, and improves bone disease, but it can also result in \nhypercalcemia and hypercalciuria through direct effects on intes\u00ad\ntinal, bone, and renal handling of calcium and phosphate. Several \nforms of active vitamin D that selectively inhibit PTH forma\u00ad\ntion while posing less risk of hypercalcemia have been developed . \nlcx-Hydroxyvitamin D2 (doxercaldferol) is a prodrug that is con\u00ad\nverted in the liver to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, whereas 19-nor-\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (paricalcltol) and calcipotriene \n(calcipotriol) are analogs of calcitriol. All cause less hypercalcemia \nand, in patients with normal renal function, less hypercalciuria \nthan calcitriol. Oral and parenteral doxercalciferol and oral pari\u00ad\ncalcitol are approved for treatment of secondary hyperparathy\u00ad\nroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. Calcipotriene \n(calcipotriol) is approved fur topical treatment of psoriasis. These \nand other analogs are being investigated for use in various malig\u00ad\nnancies and inflammatory disorders. \nThe primary toxicity caused by chronic overdose with vitamin D \nor its active metabolites is hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and \nhypercalciuria. C. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 \nFibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is secreted by osteocytes in \nbone and inhibits l,25(0H)zD production and phosphate reab\u00ad\nsorption in the kidney. It is not used as a drug. \nD. Calcltonln \nCalcitonin, a peptide hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, \ndecreases serum calcium and phosphate by inhibiting bone resorption \nand inhibiting renal reabsorption of these minerals (Figure 42-1). \nBone formation is not impaired initially, but ultimately both for\u00ad\nmation and resorption are reduced. The hormone has been used in \nconditions in which an acute reduction of serum calcium is needed \n(eg, Paget disease and hypercalcemia). Calcitonin is approved for \ntreatment of osteoporosis and has been shown to increase bone \nmass and to reduce spine fractures. However, it is not as effective \nas teriparatide or bisphosphonates. Although human calcitonin is \navailable, salmon calcitonin is most often selected for clinical use \nbecause of its longer half-life and greater potency.

Long-term use \nof estrogens is not recommended due to toxicity. SERMs such \nas raloxifene that retain effects on bone with minimal effects on \nbreast, uterus, and cardiovascular tissue can be used to prevent \nosteoporosis . \nF. Glucocortlcolds \nThe glucocorticoids (see Chapter 39) inhibit bone mineral main\u00ad\ntenance. As a result, chronic systemic use of these drugs is a com\u00ad\nmon cause of osteoporosis in adults. However, these hormones are \nuseful in the intermediate -term treatment of hypercalccmia, asso\u00ad\nciated with conditions like lymphoma and sarcoidosis . \nSKILL KEEPER: DIURETICS AND CALCIUM \n(SEE CHAPTER 15) \nThe kidney Is a key regulator of serum cakium concentra\u00ad\ntions. Several diuretics affect the kidney's handling of filtered \ncalcium. \n1. Whkh 2 dasses of diuretics have opposite effects on cal\u00ad\ncium elimination? \n2. What mechanisms are responsible for their opposing \neffects? \n3. What Is the c/lnlcal importance of these effects? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nNONHORMONALAGENTS \nA. Blsphosphonates \nThe bisphosphonates (alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate, \npamidronatc, riaedronate, tiludronatc, and zolcdronic add) are \nshort-chain organic polyphosphate compounds that reduce both \nthe resorption and the formation of bone by an action on the basic \nhydroxyapatite crystal structure. Etidronate is least potent and has \nlargely been replaced by other agents in this class. The bisphos\u00ad\nphonatcs have other complex cellular effects, including effects on \nvitamin D production and calcium absorption from the GI tract, \nand direct effects on osteoclasts, including inhibition of farncsyl \npyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme that appears to play a critical \nrole in osteoclast survival. Bisphosphonates are used to manage \nthe hypercalccmia associated with some malignancies and to treat \nPaget disease. Chronic bisphosphonate therapy is used commonly \nto prevent and treat all forms of osteoporosis . It has been shown to \nincrease bone density and reduce fractures. \nPamidrooate, roledronic acid, or etidronate are available for \nparenteral treatment of hypercalcemia associated with Paget dis\u00ad\nease and malignancies. Etidronate and the other bisphosphonatcs \nlisted above are available as oral medications. Oral bioavailability \nofbisphosphonates is low (<10%), and food impairs their absorp\u00ad\ntion. Bisphosphonatc treatment of osteoporosis is accomplished \nwith daily oral dosing (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate}; \nweekly oral dosing (alendronate, risedronate}; monthly oral dosing (ibandronatc) ; quarterly injection dosing (ibandronatc); or annual \ninfusions (roledronate). The primary toxicity of the low oral \nbisphosphonate doses used for osteoporosis is gastric and esopha\u00ad\ngeal irritation. To reduce esophageal irritation, patients are advised \nto take the drugs with large quantities of water and avoid situations \nthat permit esophageal reflux. The higher doses of bisphosphonates \nused to treat hypercalcemia and bone metastases have been associ\u00ad\nated with renal impairment and ostconecrosis of the jaw. \nB. Rank Ligand Inhibitor \nDenosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to \nand prevents the action of RANKL. Denosumab inhibits osteo\u00ad\nclast formation and activity. It is at least as effective as the potent \nbisphosphonates in inhibiting bone resorption and can be used for \ntreatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis . \nDenosumab is administered subcutaneously every 6 months, \nwhich avoids GI side effects. The drug appears to be well tolerated, \nbut there could be an increased risk of infection due to RANKL' s \nrole in the immune response. \nC. Cakimimetics \nCinacalcet lowers PTH by activating the calcium-sensing receptor \nin the parathyroid gland. It is used for oral treatment of secondary \nhypcrparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease and for the treat\u00ad\nment ofhypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Its \ntoxicities include hypocalcemia and adynamic bone disease, a con\u00ad\ndition of profoundly decreased bone cell activity. \nD.Fluoride \nAppropriate concentrations of fluoride ion in drinking water or as \nan additive in toothpaste have a wdl-documcntcd ability to reduce \ndental caries. Chronic exposure to the ion, especially in high con\u00ad\ncentrations , may increase new bone synthesis. It is not clear, how\u00ad\never, whether this new bone is normal in strength. Clinical trials \nof fluoride in patients with osteoporosis have not demonstrated a \nreduction in fractures. Acute toxicity of fluoride (usually caused \nby ingestion of rat poison) is manifested by GI and ncurologic \nsymptoms. \nE. Other Drugs with Effects on Serum calcium and \nPhosphate \nStrontium ranelate, an organic ion bound to two atoms of stron\u00ad\ntium, promotes osteoclast apoptosis and increases concentrations \nof bone formation markers; it is used in Europe for treatment of \nosteoporosis . Gallium nitrate is effective in managing the hyper\u00ad\ncalccmia associated with some malignancies and possibly Paget \ndisease. It acts by inhibiting bone resorption. To prevent nephro\u00ad\ntoxicity, patients need to be wdl hydrated and to have good renal \noutput. The antibiotic plicamycin (mitbramyci.n) has been used \nto reduce serum calcium and bone resorption in Paget disease and \nhypercalcemia. Because of the risk of serious toxicity (eg. throm\u00ad\nbocytopenia, hemorrhage, hepatic and renal damage), plicamycin \nis mainly restricted to short-term treatment of serious hypercal\u00ad\ncemia. Several diuretics, most notably thiazide diuretics and \nfuroaemide, can affect serum and urinary calcium levels (see this \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

In the treatment of patients like this with secondary hyper\u00ad\nparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease, cinacalcet is an \nalternative to vitamin D-based drugs. Cinacalcet lowers PTH \nby which of the following mechanisms? \n(A) Activating a steroid receptor that inhibits expression of \nthe PTH gene \n(B) Activating the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid \ncells \n(C) Activating transporters in the GI tract that ate involved \nin calcium absorption \n(D) Inducing the liver enzyme that converts vitamin D3 to \n25-hydrox:yvitamin D3 \n(E) Inhibiting the famesyl pyrophosphate synthase found in \nosteoclasts \nANSWERS \n1. The 2 forms of vitamin D--cholecalcifi:rol and ergocalcifi:rol\u00ad\nare commonly added to calcium supplements and dairy \nproducts. Calcitriol, the active 1,25-dihydrox:yvitamin D3 \nmetabolite, would prevent vitamin D deficiency and is avail\u00ad\nable as an oral formulation. However, because it is not subject \nto the complex mechanisms that regulate endogenous pro\u00ad\nduction of active vitamin D metabolites, it is not suitable for \nwidespread use. The answer is A. \n2. This patient has Paget disease, which is characterized by exces\u00ad\nsive bone resorption, poorly organized bone formation, and \nhypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are first-line \ntreatments . Pamidronate is a powerful bisphosphonate used \nparenterally to treat hypercalcemia. The answer is C. \n3. The active metabolites of vitamin D increase serum calcium \nand phosphate by promoting calcium and phosphate uptake \nfrom the GI tract, increasing bone resorption, and decreasing \nrenal excretion of both dectrolytes. They inhibit, rather than \nstimulate , PTH formation. The answer is D. \n4. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are vitamin D3 and D2, \nrespectively. Furosemide is a loop diuretic, which causes \nincreased calcium excretion; tamoxifen is a sdective estro\u00ad\ngen receptor modulator (SERM) but is less sdective for bone \ncompared with raloxifene. Teriparatide increases bone forma\u00ad\ntion and bone resorption; during the first 6 months, it causes \na net gain in bone. Teriparatide should not be used longer \nthan 2 years due to risk of osteosarcoma. The answer is E. \n5. Long-term therapy with glucocorticoids such as prednisone \nis associated with a reduction in bone mineral density and an \nincreased risk of fractures. The other drugs are not known to \nhave significant effects on bone or serum calcium. The answer \nis C. \n6. Oral bisphosphonates such as alendronate can irritate the \nesophagus and stomach. The risk of this toxicity is reduced by \ndrinking water and by remaining in an upright position for \n30 min after taking the medication. The answer is D. \n7. Calcitonin is a peptide hormone that prevents bone resorp\u00ad\ntion. Salmon calcitonin is available as a nasal spray or a paren\u00ad\nteral form for injection. The answer is A. \n8. In patients with chronic kidney disease that requires dialy\u00ad\nsis, the impaired production of active vitamin D metabolites \ncompounded with elevated serum phosphate due to renal impairment leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Admin\u00ad\nistration of the active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol acts \ndirectly on the parathyroid to inhibit PTH production. Cho\u00ad\nlecalciferol, a form of vitamin D, is not effective in patients \nwith advanced renal disease who cannot form adequate \namounts of active vitamin D metabolites. The answer is A. \n9. Paricalcitol is an analog of 1,25-dihydrox:yvitamin D3 {cal\u00ad\ncitriol) that lowers serum PTH at doses that rarely precipitate \nhypercalcemia. The molecular basis of this selective action \nis poorly understood but is of value in the management of \nhyperparathyroidism and psoriasis. The answer is D. \n10. Cinacalcet is a member of a novel class of drugs that activate \nthe calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid cells. When this \nreceptor is activated by cinacalcet or free ionized calcium, it \nactivates a signaling pathway that suppresses PTH synthesis \nand rdease. The answer is B. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: DIURETICS AND \nCALCIUM (SEE CHAPTER 15) \n1. Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide ) and thiazide diuretics \nhave opposite effects on urine caldum concentrations; \nloop diuretics increase urine concentrations of calcium, \nwhereas the thiazides decrease urine calcium. \n2. Loop diuretics inhibit the No+ !K'l2Cf co transporter in api\u00ad\ncal membranes of the thick ascending limb of the loop of \nHenle (see Figure 15-3). By disrupting the lumen-positive \npotential that normally serves as the driving force for \nresorption of Mif+ and eel+, loop diuretics inhibit Mif+ \nand ca2+ resorption, leaving more Mg2+ and Cr/+ in the \nurine and less in the blood. In the distal convoluted tubule \nwhere thiazides act, c? is actively resorbed through the \nconcerted action of an apical ca2+ channel and a basolat\u00ad\neral Na+ !Cc?+ exchanger (see Figure 15-4). The system is \nunder control of PTH. When thiazides inhibit the No+ /Cf \ntransporter In cells that line the distal convoluted tubule, \nthey lower the intracellular concentration of sodium \nand thereby enhance the Na+ !Cc?+ exchange that occurs \non the boso/ateral surface. This, in turn, creates a greater \ndriving force for passage of ca2+ through the apical mem\u00ad\nbrane calcium channels. The net effect is enhanced resorp\u00ad\ntion of calcium. \n3. In patients with hypercalcemia, treatment with a loop \ndiuretic plus saline promotes calcium excretion and lowers \nserum calcium. In patients with intact regulatory function, \nincreases in calcium resorption promoted by thiozides \nhave minor impact on serum calcium because of buffering \nin bone and gut. However, thiazides con unmask hyper\u00ad\nca/cemia in patients with diseases that disrupt normal \ncalcium regulation (eg, hyperparathyroidism , sarcoidosis , \ncarcinoma). Thiazide diuretics are also used for treatment \nof persons who are prone to lcidney stone formation as a \nresult of idiopathic hypercolciur ia. In such persons, it is cru\u00ad\ncial that primary hyperparathyroidism is ruled out before \nthiazide treatment is initiated. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Procaine \nand benzathine forms of penicillin G are administered intramus\u00ad\ncularly and have long plasma half-lives because the active drug is \nreleased very slowly into the bloodstream. Most penicillins cross \nthe blood-brain barrier only when the meninges are inflamed. \nC. Mechanisms of Adlon and Resistance \nBeta-lactam antibiotics are bactericidal drugs. They act to inhibit \ncell wall synthesis by the following steps (Figure 43-1): (1) bind\u00ad\ning of the drug to specific enzymes {penicillin-binding proteins \n[PBPs]) located in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane; (2) inhi\u00ad\nbition of the ttanspeptidation reaction that cross-links the linear \npeptidoglycan chain constituents of the cell wall; and (3) activation \nof autolytlc enzymes that cause lesions in the bacterial cell wall. \nEnzymatic hydrolysis of the beta.-lactam ring results in loss \nof antibacterial activity. The formation of beta-lactamases {eg, \npenicillinases) by most staphylococci and many gram-negative \norganisms is a major mechanism of bacterial resistance. Inhibi\u00ad\ntors of these bacterial enzymes {eg, davulanic acid, sulbactam, \ntuobactam) are often used in combination with penicillins to \nprevent their inactivation. Structural change in target PBPs is \nanother mechanism of resistance and is responsible for methicil\u00ad\nlin resistance in staphylococci and for resistance to penicillin G \nin pneumococci (eg, PRSP, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus \npneumoniae} and enterococci. In some gram-negative rods {eg, \nPseutlomonas aeruginosa}, changes in the porin structures in the \nouter cell wall membrane may contribute to resistance by imped\u00ad\ning access of penicillins to PBPs. D. Clinical Uses \n1. Narrow-spectrum penicillinase-susceptible agents\u00ad\nPenicillin G is the prototype of a subclass of penicillins that have \na limited spectrum of antibacterial activity and are susceptible to \nbeta-lactamases. Clinical uses include therapy of infections caused \nby common streptococci, meningococci, gram-positive bacilli, and \nspirochetes. Many strains of pneumococci are now resistant to \npenicillins (penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae [PRSP] strains). Most \nstrains of Staphywcoccus aureus and a significant number of strains of \nNeisseria gono\"hoeae are resistant via production ofbeta-lactamases. \nAlthough no longer suitable for treatment of gonorrhea, penicillin \nG remains the drug of choice for syphilis. Activity against entero\u00ad\ncocci is enhanced by coadministration of aminoglycosides. Penicil\u00ad\nlin V is an oral drug used mainly in oropharyngeal infections. \n2. Very-narrow-spectrum penicillinase-resistant drugs\u00ad\nThis subclass of penicillins includes methicillin (the prototype, but \nrarely used owing to its nephrotoxic potential), nafcillin, and o:m\u00ad\ncillin. Their primary use is in the treatment of known or suspected \nstaphylococcal infections. Methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci \n(S aureus [MRSA] and S epidnmidis [MRSE]) are resistant to all \npenicillins and are often resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs. \n3. Wider-spectrum penlcllllnase-susceptlble drugs \na. Am picil lin and amoxicil lin-These drugs make up a penicil\u00ad\nlin subgroup that has a wider spectrum of antibacterial activity than \npenicillin G but remains susceptible to penicillinases. Their clinical \nuses include indications similar to penicillin G as well as infections \nresulting from enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, \nPro~ mirabi/is, Haemophilus influmzae, and Moraxe/Ja cata\"ha/is, \nalthough resistant strains occur.

Most first-and second\u00ad\ngeneration cephalosporins do not enter the cerebrospinal fluid \neven when the meninges are inflamed. \nC. Mechanisms of Adlon and Resistance \nCephalosporins bind to PBPs on bacterial cell membranes to \ninhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by mechanisms similar to those \nof the penicillins. Cephalosporins are bactericidal against suscep\u00ad\ntible organisms. \nStructural differences from penicillins render cephalosporins \nless susceptible to penicillinases produced by staphylococci, but \nmany bacteria are resistant through the production of other beta\u00ad\nlactamases that can inactivate cephalosporins. Resistance can also \nresult from decreases in membrane permeability to cephalosporins \nand from changes in PBPs. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are \nalso resistant to cephalosporins . \nD. Clinical Uses \n1. First-generation drugs-Cefazolin (parenteral) and cepha\u00ad\nlc:rin (oral) are examples of this subgroup. They are active against \ngram-positive cocci, including staphylococci and common strepto\u00ad\ncocci. Many strains of E coli and K pneumoniae are also sensitive. \nClinical uses include treatment ofinfections caused by these organ\u00ad\nisms and surgical prophylaxis in selected conditions. These drugs \nhave minimal activity against gram-negative cocci, enterococci, \nmethicillin-resistant staphylococci, and most gram-negative rods. \n2. Second-generation drugs-Ce&dor, cefuroxime, and cef\u00ad\nprozil. Drugs in this subgroup usually have slightly less activity \nagainst gram-positive organisms than the first-generation drugs \nbut have an extended gram-negative coverage. Marked differences \nin activity occur among the drugs in this subgroup. Examples of \nclinical uses include infections caused by the anaerobe Bacteroitles \nfragilis (cefotetan, cefoxitin) and sinus, ear, and respiratory \ninfections caused by H injlumr,ae or M catarrhalis (cefuroxime, \ncefaclor). \n3. Third-generation drugs-Characteristic features of third\u00ad\ngcncration drugs (cg, ceftazidime, cefotaxime) include increased \nactivity against gram-negative organisms resistant to other beta\u00ad\nlactam drugs and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier \n(except ceftximc). Most arc active against Providencia, Serratia \nmarcescms, and beta-lactamase-producing strains of H injluenzae \nand Neissma; they are less active against Enterobacter strains that \nproduce extended-spectrum bcta-lactamascs. Ccftriaxone and \ncefotaxime are currently the most active cephalosporins against \npenicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRSP strains), but resistance is \nreported. Individual drugs also have activity against Pseudomonas \n(ceftazidime) and B fragilis (cefmo:rlme). Drugs in this subclass \nshould usually be reserved for treatment of serious infections. \nCeftriaxone (parenteral) and cefi:rlme (oral), currently drugs \nof choice in gonorrhea, arc exceptions. Likewise, in acute otitis \nmedia, a single injection of ceftriaxone is usually as effective as a \n10-day course of treatment with amoxicillin. 4. Fourth-generation drugs-cefepime is more resistant to \nbeta-lactamases produced by gram-negative organisms, including \nEnterobacter, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and some penicillin-resistant \npneumococci. Cefepimc combines the gram-positive activity of \nfirst-generation agents with the wider gram-negative spectrum of \nthird-generation cephalosporins. Ceftaroline has activity in infec\u00ad\ntions caused by mcthicillin-resistant staphylococci. \nE. Toxicity \nJ. Allergy-Ccphalosporins cause a range of allergic reactions \nfrom skin rashes to anaphylactic shock. These reactions occur less \nfrequently with ccphalosporins than with penicillins. Complete \ncross-hypersensitivity between different cephalosporins should be \nassumed. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins \nis incomplete (5-10%), so penicillin-allergic patients arc some\u00ad\ntimes treated successfully with a cephalosporin. However, patients \nwith a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins should not be treated \nwith a cephalosporin. \n2. Other adverse effects-Cephalosporins may cause pain \nat intramuscular injection sites and phlebitis after intravenous \nadministration. They may increase the ncphrotoxicity of amino\u00ad\nglycosides when the two are administered together. Drugs con\u00ad\ntaining a methylthiotetrazole group (eg, cefoperazone, cefotetan) \nmay cause hypoprothrombincmia and disulflram-likc reactions \nwith ethanol. \nOTHER BETA-LACTAM DRUGS \nA. Aztreonam \nAmeonam is a monobactam that is resistant to beta-lactamases \nproduced by certain gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella, \nPseudomonas, and Serratia. The drug has no activity against gram\u00ad\npositive bacteria or anaerobes. It is an inhibitor of cell wall synthe\u00ad\nsis, preferentially binding to a specific penicillin-binding protein \n(PBP3), and is synergistic with aminoglycosidcs. \nAztreonam is administered intravenously and is eliminated \nvia renal tubular secretion. Its half-life is prolonged in renal fail\u00ad\nure. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset with possible \nsuperinfcction, vertigo and headache, and rarely hepatotoxicity. \nAlthough skin rash may occur, there is no cross-allergenicity with \npenicillins. \nB. lmlpenem, Dorlpenem, Meropenem, and Ertapenem \nThese drugs are carbapenems (chemically different from penicil\u00ad\nlins but retaining the beta-lactam ring structure) with low sus\u00ad\nceptibility to beta-lactamases. They have wide activity against \ngram-positive cocci (including some penicillin-resistant pneumo\u00ad\ncocci), gram-negative rods, and anaerobes. With the exception of \nertapenem, the carbapenems arc active against P aeruginosa and \nAcinetobacter species. For pseudomonal infections, they are often \nused in combination with an aminoglycoside. The carbapenems \narc administered parcntcrally and arc useful fur infections caused \nby organisms resistant to other antibiotics. However, MRSA strains"

Carbapenems are currently co-drugs \nof choice fur infections caused by Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and \nSerratia species. Imipenem is rapidly inactivated by renal dehydro\u00ad\npeptidase I and is administered in fixed combination with cilas\u00ad\ntatin, an inhibitor of this enzyme. Cilastatin increases the plasma \nhalf-life of imipenem and inhibits the formation of a potentially \nnephrotoxic metabolite. The other carbapenems are not signifi\u00ad\ncantly degraded by the kidney. \nAdverse effects of imipenem-cilastatin include gastrointestinal \ndistress, skin rash, and, at very high plasma levels, CNS toxicity (con\u00ad\nfusion, encephalopathy, seizures). There is partial cross-allergenicity \nwith the penicillins. Meropenem is similar to imipenem except \nthat it is not metabolized by renal dehydropeptidases and is less \nlikely to cause seizures. Ertapenem has a long half-life but is less \nactive against enterococci and Pseutiomonas, and its intramuscular \ninjection causes pain and irritation. \nC. Beta-Ladamase Inhibitors \nClavulanic acid, sulbattam, and tazobactam are used in fixed \ncombinations with certain hydrolyzable penicillins. They are most \nactive against plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases such as those pro\u00ad\nduced by gonococci, streptococci, E coli, and H influenzae. They \nare not good inhibitors of inducible chromosomal beta-lactamases \nformed by Enterobacttr, Pseudomonas, and Serratia. \nOTHER CELL WALL OR \nMEMBRANE-ACTIVE AGENTS \nA. Vancomycin \nVancomycin is a bactericidal glycoprotein that binds to the \no-Ala-o-Ala terminal of the nascent peptidoglycan pentapeptide \nside chain and inhibits transglycosylation. This action prevents \nelongation of the peptidoglycan chain and interferes with cross\u00ad\nlinking. Resistance in strains of enterococci (vancomycin-resistant \nenterococci [VRE]) and staphylococci (vancomycin-resistant \nS aureus [VRSA]) involves a decreased affinity of vancomycin for \nthe binding site because of the replacement of the terminal D-Ala \nby o-lactate. V ancomycin has a narrow spectrum of activity and is \nused for serious infections caused by drug-resistant gram-positive \norganisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA), \nand in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin such as \nceftriaxone for treatment of infections due to penicillin-resistant \npneumococci (PRSP). Vancomycin is also used in the treatment of \ninfections caused by Clostritiioitles (formerly Clostritlium} difficile. \nTeicoplanin and telavancin, other glycopeptide derivatives, have \nsimilar characteristics. \nV ancomycin-resistant enterococci are increasing and pose a \npotentially serious clinical problem because such organisms usu\u00ad\nally exhibit multiple-drug resistance. V ancomycin-intermediate \nstrains of S aureus resulting in treatment failures have also been \nreported. V ancomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal \ntract and may be given orally for bacterial enterocolitis. When given parenterally, vancomycin penetrates most tissues and is elim\u00ad\ninated unchanged in the urine. Dosage modification is mandatory \nin patients with renal impairment. Toxic effects of vancomycin \ninclude chills, fever, phlebitis, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. \nRapid intravenous infusion may cause diffuse flushing (\"red man \nsyndrome\") from histamine release. \nB. Daptomycln \nDaptomycin is a novel cyclic lipopeptide with spectrum similar \nto vancomycin but active against vancomycin-resistant strains of \nenterococci and staphylococci. The drug inserts into the cytoplas\u00ad\nmic membrane, causing potassium leak and cell death. Daptomy\u00ad\ncin is eliminated via the kidney. Creatine phosphokinase should be \nmonitored because daptomycin may cause myopathy. \nC. Fosfomycin \nFosfomycin is an antimetabolite inhibitor of cytosolic enolpyruvate \ntransferase. This action prevents the formation of N-acetylmuramic \nacid, an essential precursor molecule for peptidoglycan chain for\u00ad\nmation. Resistance to fosfomycin occurs via decreased intracellular \naccumulation of the drug. \nFosfomycin is excreted by the kidney, with urinary levels \nexceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MI Cs) for many \nurinary tract pathogens. In a single dose, the drug is less effective \nthan a 7-day course of treatment with fluoroquinolones. How\u00ad\never, with multiple dosing, resistance emerges rapidly and diarrhea \nis common. Fosfomycin may be synergistic with beta-lactam and \nquinolone antibiotics in specific infections. \nD. Bacitracin \nBacitracin is a peptide antibiotic that interferes with a late stage \nin cell wall synthesis in gram-positive organisms. Because of its \nmarked nephrotoxicity , the drug is limited to topical use. \nE. Cycloserlne \nCycloserine is an antimetabolite that blocks the incorporation \nof o-Ala into the pentapeptide side chain of the peptidoglycan. \nBecause of its potential neurotoxicity (tremors, seizures, psycho\u00ad\nsis}, cycloserine is only used to treat tuberculosis caused by organ\u00ad\nisms resistant to first-line antituberculosis drugs. \nQUESTIONS \nI. JT is a 14-year-old patient who is diagnosed with otitis media \nand is prescribed amoxicillin. She returns 72 hours later with \nno signs of improvement, which suggests that the bacteria \ncausing the infection is resistant to amoxicillin.

A \nblood culture reveals the presence of gram-negative bacilli. \nThe initial diagnosis is bacteremia, and parenteral antibiotics \nare indicated. The records of the patient reveal that she had a \nsevere urticarial rash, hypotension, and respiratory difficulty \nafter oral penicillin V about 6 months ago. The most appro\u00ad\npriate drug regimen for empiric treatment is \n(A) Aztreonam \n(B) Ceftriaxone \n(C) Meropenem \n(D) Oxacillin \n(E) Ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid \nQuestions 6-8. A 52-ycar-old man (weight 70 kg) is brought \nto the hospital emergency department in a confused and deliri\u00ad\nous state. He has had an elevated temperature for more than \n24 h, during which time he had complained of a severe headache \nand had suffered from nausea and vomiting. Lumbar puncture \nreveals an elevated opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid find\u00ad\nings include elevated protein, decreased glucose, and increased \nneutrophils. Gram stain of a smear of cerebrospinal fluid reveals \ngram-positive diplococci, and a preliminary diagnosis is made of purulent meningitis. The microbiology repon informs you that \nfor approximatdy 15% of S pneumoniae isolates in the com\u00ad\nmunity, the minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin G is \n20 mcg/mL. \n6. Treatment of this patient should be initiated immediately \nwith intravenous administration of \n(A) Amoxicillin \n(B) Cephalexin \n(C) Ceftriaxone plus vancomycin \n(D) Nafcillin \n(E) Piperacillin \n7. Resistance of pneumococci to penicillin G is due to \n(A) Alterations in porin structure \n(B) Beta-lactamase production \n(C) Changes in chemical structure of target penicillin\u00ad\nbinding proteins \n(D) Changes in the o-Ala-o-Ala building block of peptido\u00ad\nglycan precursor \n(E) Decreased intracellular accumulation of penicillin G \n8. If this patient had been 82 years old and the Gram stain of the \nsmear of cerebrospinal fluid had revealed gram-positive rods \nresembling diphtheroids, the antibiotic regimen for empiric \ntreatment would include \n(A) Ampicillin \n(B) Cefoxitin \n(C) Ceftriaxone \n(D) Fosfomycin \n(E) V ancomycin \n9. A patient needs antibiotic treatment for native valve, culture-\u00ad\npositive infective enterococcal endocarditis. His medical his\u00ad\ntory includes a severe anaphylactic reaction to penicillin G \nduring the last year. The best approach would be treatment \nwith \n(A) Amoxicillin-clavulanate \n(B) Aztreonam \n(C) Ceftriaxone \n(D) Piperacillin \n(E) V ancomycin \n10. Which statement about vancomycin is accurate? \n(A) Active against methicillin -resistant staphylococci \n(B) Bacteriostatic \n(C) Binds to PBPs \n(D) Inhibits transpeptidation \n(E) Oral bioavailability \nANSWERS \nI. Penicillins bind to PBPs, which act at the transpeptidation \nstage of cell wall synthesis (the final step), and inhibit pepti\u00ad\ndoglycan cross-linking. Cephalosporins, carbapenems, mono\u00ad\nbactams, and other penicillins act similarly. JT's resistance to \namoxicillin may be due to increased bacterial production of \nbeta-lactamases, so addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor will \nincrease the efficacy of amoxicillin. The answer is A. \n2. Treatments of choice for gonorrhea include a single dose of \nceftriaxone (intramuscularly).

Alterna\u00ad\ntive drugs (not listed) for gonorrhea include cef.txime, azithro\u00ad\nmycin (see Chapter 44) or spectinomycin (see Chapter 45). \nThe answer is A. \n3. This patient with gonorrhea also has primary syphilis. The \npenile chancre, the enlarged nontender lymph nodes, and the \nmicroscopic identification of treponemes in fluid expressed \nfrom the lesion are essentials of diagnosis. Although a single \ndose of ceftriaxone may cure incubating syphilis, it cannot be \nrelied on for treating primary syphilis. The most appropriate \ncourse of action in this patient is to administer a single intra\u00ad\nmuscular injection of 2.4 million units of benzathine peni\u00ad\ncillin G. For penicillin-allergic patients, oral doxycycline or \ntetracycline for 15 d (not 7 d) is effective in most cases (see \nChapter 44). However, lack of compliance may be a problem \nwith oral therapy. Fosfomycin and vancomycin have no sig\u00ad\nnificant activity against spirochetes. The answer is C. \n4. First-and second-generation cephalosporins are not effec\u00ad\ntive in meningitis because they do not readily enter the cere\u00ad\nbrospinal fluid. Instability of penicillins in gastric acid does \nlimit their oral absorption, renal elimination of amoxicillin \nis inhibited by probenecid, and ticarcillin has activity against \nseveral gram-negative rods. The answer is B. \n5. Each of the drugs listed has activity against some gram\u00ad\nnegative bacilli. All penicillins should be avoided in patients \nwith a history of allergic reactions to any individual penicillin \ndrug. Cephalosporins should also be avoided in patients who \nhave had anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reac\u00ad\ntions after use of a penicillin. There is partial cross-reactivity \nbetween penicillins and the carbapenems such as imipenem \nand meropenem, but no cross-reactivity between the penicil\u00ad\nlins and aztreonam. The answer is A. \n6. Pneumococcal isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentra\u00ad\ntion for penicillin G of greater than 2 mcg/mL are highly \nresistant. Such strains are not killed by the concentrations \nof penicillin G or ampicillin that can be achieved in the \ncerebrospinal fluid.

Cefotaxime \nand ceftriaxone are the most active cephalosporins against \npenicillin-resistant pneumococci, and the addition of vanco\u00ad\nmycin is recommended in the case of highly resistant strains. \nThe answer is C. \n7. Pneumococcal resistance to penicillins is due to changes in \nthe chemical structures of the target penicillin-binding pro\u00ad\nteins located in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. A simi\u00ad\nlar mechanism underlies the resistance of staphylococci to \nmethicillin (MRSA strains). A structural alteration in the \no-Ala-o-Ala component of the pentapeptide side chains of \npeptidoglycans is the basis for a mechanism of resistance to \nvancomycin. The answer is C. \n8. Diphtheroid-like gram-positive rods in the cerebrospinal \nfluid smear of an elderly patient are indicative of L mono\u00ad\ncytogmes. Listeria infections are more common in neonates, \nelderly patients, and those who have been treated with immu\u00ad\nnosuppressive agents. Cephalosporins do not cover listeria. \n(The mnemonic for the hole in their spectrum is \"LAME\": \nlisteria, atypicals, MRSA, and enterococcus.) Treatment con\u00ad\nsists of ampicillin with or without an aminoglycoside such as \ngcntamicin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can also be used \n(see Chapter 46). The answer is A. \n9. In patients who have had a severe reaction to a penicillin, it \nis inadvisable to administer a cephalosporin or a carbapenem \nsuch as meropenem. Aztreonam has no significant activity \nagainst gram-positive cocci, so the logical treatment in this case \nis vancomycin, often with an aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) \nfor synergistic activity against enterococci. The answer is E. \n10. Vancomycin is a bactericidal glycoprotein. It inhibits cell wall \nsynthesis but docs not bind to PBPs and is not susceptible \nto beca-lactamases. Vancomycin is not absorbed after oral \nadministration and is used by this route in the treatment of \ncolitis caused by C difficile and staphylococci. It undergoes \nrenal elimination and inhibits transglycosylation.

Newer inhibitors of miaobial \nprotein ~thesis, including streptogramins. linewlid, tclithromycin, \nand tigeqdllic (a retracycline analog), have activity against certain bac\u00ad\nteria that have developed .resiatmce to older antibiotia. \nMECHANISMS OF ACTION \nMost of the antibiotic:s reviewed in this chapter are bacterio\u00ad\nstatic inhibitors of protein synthesis acting at the ribosomal level \n(Figure 44-1). With the exception of tetracyclines, the binding \nsites for these antibiotics arc on the 50S ribosomal subunit. Chlor\u00ad\namphen.icol inhibits transpeptidation (catalyzed by peptidyl trans\u00ad\nferase) by blocking the binding of the aminoacyl moiety of the \ncharged transfer RNA (tRNA) mo1ccule to the acceptor site on \nthe ribosome-messenger (mRNA) complex. Thus, the peptide \nat the donor site cannot be tramferred to its amino acid accep\u00ad\ntor. Macrolides, tclithromycin, and clindamycin, which share a \nUncharged tRNA common binding site on the SOS ribosome, also block transpepti\u00ad\ndation. Tetracyclines bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit, prevent\u00ad\ning binding of amino acid-charged tRNA to the acceptor site of \nthe ribosome-mRNA complex. \nStreptogramins are bactericidal for most susceptible organ\u00ad\nisms. They bind to the SOS ribosomal subunit, constricting the \nctlt channel through which nascent polypeptides are extruded. \nIn addition, tRNA syntherase activity is inhibited, leading to \ndecreased free tRNA within the cell. Linezolid iii mainly bacterio\u00ad\nstatic and binds to a unique site on the 50S ribosome, inhibiting \ninitiation by blocking formation of the tRNA-ribosome--mRNA \nternary complex. \nThe selective toxicity of these drugs may be explained by target \ndifferences. Chloramphenicol does not bind to SOS ribosomes of \nmammalian cells, although it can inhibit the functions of mito\u00ad\nchondrill.l ribosomes, which contain ?OS ribosomes. Tetracyclines \nhave little effect on mammalian protein synthesis because an active \nefflux mecltanism prevents intracellular accumulation. \nFIGURE 44-1 Steps In bacterial protein synthesis and targets of several antibiotics. Amino acids are shown as numbered circles. The 705 \nrlbosomal mRNA complex Is shown with Its SOS and 305 subunits. In step 1, the charged tRNA unit carrying amino add 6 binds to the acceptor \nsite on the 70S ribosome. The peptldyl tRNA at the donor site, with amino acids 1 through S, then binds the growing amino acid chain to amino \nacid 6 (transpeptldatlon, step 2). The uncharged tRNA left at the donor site Is released (step 3), and the new &-amino acid chain with Its tRNA \nshifts to the peptldyl site (translocatlon, step 4).

Classification \nDrugs in this class are broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotics \nthat have only minor differences in their activities against specific \norganisms. \nB. Pharmacoklnetlcs \nOral absorption is variable, especially for the older drugs, and may \nbe impaired by foods and multivalent cations (calcium, iron, alu\u00ad\nminum). Tetracyclines have a wide tissue distribution and cross the \nplacental barrier, and most undergo enterohepatic cycling. Most tet\u00ad\nracyclines are hepatically metabolized and eventually renally elimi\u00ad\nnated. Doxycycline is not hepatically metabolized, and doxycycline \nand tigecycline are excreted mainly in feces. Thus, these two drugs \ndo not require dose-adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction. \nTetracycline has a short half-life (6-11 h), while doxycycline and \nminocycline have longer half-lives (15-23 h), and tigecycline has \na half-life of 30-36 h. \nC. Antibacterial Activity \nT etraeyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against \ngram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, species of Ricktttsia, \nChlamydia, Mycoplasma, and some protozoa. \nHowever, resistance to most tetracyclines is widespread. Resis\u00ad\ntance mechanisms include the devdopment of effiux pumps for active \nextrusion of tetracyclines and the formation of ribosomal protection \nproteins that interfere with tetracycline binding. These mechanisms \ndo not confer resistance to tigecycline, with the exception of the mul\u00ad\ntidrug efflux pumps of Proteus and Psnulomonas species. \nD. Cllnlcal Uses \n1. Primary uses-Tetracyclines are recommended in the treat\u00ad\nment of infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumonille (in adults), \nchlamydiae, rickettsiae, vibrios, and some spirochetes. Doxycy\u00ad\ncline is currently an alternative to macrolides in the initial treat\u00ad\nment of community-acquired pneumonia. \n2. Secondary uses-Tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the \ntreatment of syphilis. They are also used in the treatment of respi\u00ad\nratory infections caused by susceptible organisms, for prophylaxis \nagainst infection in chronic bronchitis, in the treatment of lepto\u00ad\nspirosis, and in the treatment of acne. \n3. Selective uses-Specific tetracyclines are used in the treat\u00ad\nment of gastrointestinal ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori \n(tetracycline), in Lyme disease (doxycycline), and in the menin\u00ad\ngococcal carrier state (minocydine). Doxycycline is also used for \nthe prevention of malaria and in the treatment of amebiasis (see \nChapter 52). Demeclocydine inhibits the renal actions of antidi\u00ad\nuretic hormone (ADH) and is used in the management of patients \nwith ADH-secreting tumors (see Chapter 15). \n4. Tigecycline-Unique features of this glycylcycline derivative \nof minocycline include a broad spectrum of action (including organisms resistant to other tetracyclines). The antimicrobial \nactivity of tigecydine includes gram-positive cocci resistant to \nmethicillin (MRSA strains) and vancomycin (VRE strains), beta\u00ad\nlactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, anaerobes, chlamyd\u00ad\niae, and mycobacteria. It is formulated only for IV use. \nE. Toxicity \n1. Gastrointestinal disturbances-Effects on the gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal system range from mild nausea and diarrhea to severe, possi\u00ad\nbly life-threatening enterocolitis. Disturbances in the normal flora \nmay lead to candidiasis (oral and vaginal) and, more rarely, to \nbacterial superinfections with S aureus or Clostridioides (formerly \nClostridium) difficile. \n2. Bony structures and teeth-Fetal exposure to tetracyclines \nmay lead to tooth enamel dysplasia and irregularities in bone \ngrowth. Although usually contraindicated in pregnancy, there may \nbe situations in which the benefit of tetracyclines outweighs the \nrisk. Treatment of younger children may cause enamel dysplasia \nand crown deformation when permanent teeth appear. \n3. Hepatic toxicity-High doses of tetracyclines, especially in \npregnant patients and those with preexisting hepatic disease, may \nimpair liver function and lead to hepatic necrosis. \n4. Renal toxicity-One form of renal tubular acidosis, Fanconi \nsyndrome, has been attributed to the use of outdated tetracyclines. \nThough not directly nephrotoxic, tetracyclines may exacerbate \npreexisting renal dysfunction. \n5. Photosensltlvlry- Tetracyclines, especially demeclocycline, \nmay cause enhanced skin sensitivity to ultraviolet light. \n6. Vestibular toxicity-Dose-dependent reversible dizziness \nand vertigo have been reponed with doxycycline and minocycline. \nMACRO LI DES \nA. Classification and Pharmacokinetics \nThe macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, azithromycin, and \nclarithromycin) are large cyclic lactone ring structures with \nattached sugars. The drugs have good oral bioavailability, but \nazithromycin absorption is impeded by food. Macrolides dis\u00ad\ntribute to most body tissues, but azithromycin levels achieved in \ntissues and in phagocytes are considerably higher than those in \nthe plasma. Metabolism is primarily hepatic. The elimination of \nerythromycin and clarithromycin is fairly rapid (half-lives of 2 and \n6 h, respectively), whereas azithromycin is eliminated slowly (half\u00ad\nlife 2-4 d). \nB.

The drug is also \nactive against gram-positive cocci (but not penicillin-resistant \nStreptococcus pntumonilu [PRSP] strains) and beta-lactamasc\u00ad\nproducing staphylococci {but not MRSA strains). \nAzithromycin has a similar spectrum of activity but is more \nactive against Haemophilus influenzM, Moraxella cata\"hali.s, and \nNeisstria. Because of its long half-life, a single dose of azithromycin \nis effective in the treatment of genitourinary infections caused by \nC trachomatis, and a 4-d course of treatment has been effective in \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. \nClarithromycin has almost the same spectrum of antimicrobial \nactivity and clinical uses as crythromycin. The drug is also used for \nprophylaxis against and treatment of M avium complex and as a \ncomponent of drug regimens fur ulcers caused by H pylori. \nFidaxomicin is a narrow-spectrum macrolide antibiotic that \ninhibits protein synthesis and is selectively active against gram\u00ad\npositivc aerobcs and anaerobes. Given orally, systemic absorption \nis minimal. Fidaxomicin has proved to be as effective as vanco\u00ad\nmycin for the treatment of C difficile colitis, possibly with a lower \nrdapse rate. \nD. Toxicity \nAdverse effects, especially with erythromycin, include gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal irritation (common) via stimulation of motilin receptors, skin \nrashes, and cosinophilia. A hypersensitivity-based acute cholcstatic \nhepatitis may occur with erythromycin estolate. Hepatitis is rare in \nchildren, but there is an increased risk with crythromycin cstolatc \nin the pregnant patient. Erythromycin inhibits several forms of \nhepatic cytochrome P450 and can increase the plasma levels of \nmany drugs, including anticoagulants, carbama7.epine, cisapridc, \nand digoxin. Similar drug interactions have occurred with clar\u00ad\nithromycin. The lactone ring structure of azithromycin is slightly \ndifferent from that of other macrolides, and drug interactions arc \nuncommon because azithromycin docs not inhibit hepatic cyto\u00ad\nchrome P450. TELITHROMYCIN \nTelithromycin is a ketolide structurally related to macrolides. The \ndrug has the same mechanism of action as crythromycin and a simi\u00ad\nlar spectrum of antimicrobial activity. However, some macrolide\u00ad\nresistant strains are susceptible to telithromycin because it binds \nmore tightly to ribosomes and is a poor substrate for bacterial \nefflux pumps that mediate resistance. The drug can be used in \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia including infections caused by \nmultidrug-resistant organisms. T dithromycin is given orally once \ndaily and is eliminated in the bile and the urine. The adverse effects \nof telithromycin include gastrointestinal and hepatic dysfunction \nand prolongation of the QT c interval. The drug is an inhibitor of \nthe CYP3A4 drug-metabolizing s~tcm. \nCLINDAMYCIN \nA. Classification and Phannac:okinetfcs \nClindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via a mecha\u00ad\nnism similar to that of the macrolidcs, although it is not chemi\u00ad\ncally rdatcd. Mechanisms of resistance include mcthylation of the \nbinding site on the SOS ribosomal subunit and enzymatic inacti\u00ad\nvation. Gram-negative aerobes are intrinsically resistant because \nof poor penetration of clindamycin through the outer membrane. \nCross-resistance between clindamycin and macrolides is common. \nGood tissue penetration occurs after oral absorption . Clindamycin \nundergoes hepatic metabolism, and both intact drug and metabo\u00ad\nlites are eliminated by renal and biliary excretion. \nB. Clinical Use and Toxidty \nThe main use of clindamycin is in the treatment of severe infec\u00ad\ntions caused by certain anaerobes such as Batteroilks, Fuso\u00ad\nbaam11m, and Prevoulla (however, there arc increasing rates \nof resistance among B fragilis). Clindamycin has been used as \na backup drug against gram-positive cocci (it is active against \ncommunity-acquired strains of MRSA) and is recommended for \nprophylaxis of cndocarditis in valvular disease patients who arc \nallergic to penicillin. The drug is also used in combination with \npyrimethamine for AIDS-related toxoplasmosis. The toxicity of \nclindamycin includes gastrointestinal irritation, skin rashes, neu\u00ad\ntropenia, hepatic dysfunction , and possible supcrinfections such as \nC difficile pseudomembranous colitis. \nSTREPTOGRAMINS \nQuinupristin-dalfopristin , a combination of two strcptogramins, \nis bactericidal (see prior discussion of mechanism of action) and \nhas a duration of antibacterial activity longer than the half-lives \nof the two compounds (postantibiotic effects). Antibacterial activ\u00ad\nity includes Streptococcus pyogmes, Staphylococcus aureus {methicil\u00ad\nlin susceptible and resistant), vancomycin-resistant staphylococci \n(VRSA), and resistant Enterococcus faecium; E faecalis is intrin\u00ad\nsically resistant via an efflux transpon system.

Streptogramins are potent inhibi\u00ad\ntors ofCYP3A4 and increase plasma levels of many drugs, includ\u00ad\ning astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, diazepam, nonnucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, and warfarin. \nCHLORAMPHENICOL \nA. Classification and Pharmacokinetics \nChloramphenicol has a simple and distinctive structure, and no \nother antimicrobials have been discovered in this chemical class. It \nis effective orally as well as parenterally and is widely distributed, \nreadily crossing the placental and blood-brain barriers. Chloram\u00ad\nphenicol undergoes enterohepatic cycling, and a fraction of the \ndose is excreted in the urine unchanged. Most of the drug is inac\u00ad\ntivated by a hepatic glucuronosyltransferase. \nB. Antimicrobial Adivity \nChloramphenicol has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity \nand is usually bacteriostatic. Some strains of H influenzae and \nNeissma mmingitidis are highly susceptible, and for these organ\u00ad\nisms, chloramphenicol may be bactericidal. It is not active against \nChl.amydia species. Resistance to chloramphenicol, which is plas\u00ad\nmid-mediated, occurs through the formation of acetyltransferases \nthat inactivate the drug. \nC. Clinical Uses \nBecause of its toxicity, chloramphenicol has very few uses as a \nsystemic drug. It is a backup drug fur severe infections caused \nby Salmonella species and for the treatment of pneumococcal \nand meningococcal meningitis in beta-lactam-sensitive persons. \nChloramphenicol is sometimes used for rickettsial diseases and \nfor infections caused by anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The \ndrug is commonly used as a topical antimicrobial agent. \nD. Toxicity \n1. Gastrointestinal disturbances-These conditions may \noccur from direct irritation and from superinfections, especially \ncandidiasis. \n2. Bone marrow-Inhibition of red cell maturation leads to a \ndecrease in circulating erythrocytes. This action is dose-dependent \nand reversible. Aplastic anemia is a rare idiosyncratic reaction \n(approximately 1 case in 25,000-40,000 patients treated). It is \nusually irreversible and may be fatal. \n3. Gray baby syndrome-This syndrome occurs in infants and \nis characterized by decreased red blood cells, cyanosis, and car\u00ad\ndiovascular collapse. Neonates, especially premature neonates, are \ndeficient in hepatic glucuronosyltransferase and are sensitive to \ndoses of chloramphenicol that would be tolerated in older infants. \n4. Drug lnteractlons-Chloramphenicol inhibits hepatic drug\u00ad\nmetabolizing enzymes, thus increasing the elimination half-lives of \ndrugs including phenytoin, tolbutamide, and warfarin. OXAZOLIDINONES \nThe first of a novel class of antibiotics (oxazolidinones), linezolid is \nactive against drug-resistant gram-positive cocci, including strains \nresistant to penicillins (eg, MRSA, PRSP) and vancomycin (eg, \nVRE). The drug is also active against Listeria monocytogmes and \ncorynebacteria. Linezolid binds to a unique site located on the 23S \nribosomal RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and there is cur\u00ad\nrently no cross-resistance with other protein synthesis inhibitors. \nResistance (rare to date) involves a decreased affinity of linezolid \nfor its binding site. Linezolid is available in both oral and paren\u00ad\nteral formulations and should be reserved for treatment of infec\u00ad\ntions caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. The \ndrug is metabolized by the liver and has an elimination half-life \nof 4-6 h. Thrombocycopenia and neutropenia occur, most com\u00ad\nmonly in immunosuppressed patients and infants. Linezolid has \nbeen implicated in the serotonin syndrome when used in patients \ntaking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRis). \nT ediwlid is a pro drug of tedizolid phosphate, a next-generation \noxazolidinone, with high potency against gram-positive bacteria, \nincluding MRSA. \nQUESTIONS \nI. A 4-year-old child is brought to the hospital after ingesting \npills that a parent had used for bacterial dysentery when trav\u00ad\neling outside the United States. The child has been vomiting \nfor more than 24 h and has had diarrhea with green stools. \nShe is now lethargic with an ashen color. Other signs and \nsymptoms include hypothermia, hypotension, and abdomi\u00ad\nnal distention. The drug most likely to be the cause of this \nproblem is \n(A) Ampicillin \n(B) Azithromycin \n(C) Chloramphenicol \n(D) Doxycycline \n(E) Erythromycin \n2. A pathogen commonly responsible for community-acquired \npneumonia is S pneumoniae. In which of the following situa\u00ad\ntions would you NOT suggest creating S pneumoniae with a \nmacrolide antibiotic? \n(A) The patient has a history of aplastic anemia \n(B) The patient is over 65 years of age \n(C) The patient is younger than 4 years of age \n(D) The patient lives in a region where S pneumoniae is \nhighly resistant to macrolides \n(E) The patient takes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRis) \n3. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have very similar spectra of \nantimicrobial activity. The major advantage of clarithromycin \nis that it \n(A) Does not inhibit hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes \n(B) Eradicates mycoplasmal infections in a single dose \n(C) Has greater activity against H pylori \n(D) Is active against methicillin-resistantstrains of staphylococci \n(E) Is active against strains of streptococci that are resistant \nto erythromycin"

She appears to have some respiratory difficulty, \nand chest examination reveals rales but no other obvious signs of \npulmonary involvement. However, extensive patchy infiltrates are \nseen on chest x-ray ftlm. Gram stain of expectorated sputum fails \nto reveal any bacterial pathogens. The patient mentions that a col\u00ad\nleague at work had similar symptoms to those she is experiencing. \nThe patient has no history of serious medical problems. She takes \nloratadine for allergies and supplementary iron tablets, and she \ndrinks at least 6 cups of caffe.inated coffee per day.

The answer is C. \n2. Antimicrobial resistance can vary drastically by geography. \nFor example, approximatdy 94% of Streptococcus pneumoniat \nisolates in China were found to be resistant to macrolide \nantibiotics in 2017, 34% were resistant in the United States, \nand only 5% were resistant in Sweden. Furthermore, differ\u00ad\nent mechanisms of resistance have been observed in different \nregions: efflux pump resistance is more common in North \nAmerica, whereas ribosomal mechanisms are more common \nin Europe. The answer is D. \n3. Clarithromycin can be administered less frequently than \nerythromycin, but it is not effective in single doses against \nsusceptible organisms. Organisms resistant to erythromycin, \nincluding pneumococci and methicillin-resistant staphylo\u00ad\ncocci, are also resistant to other macrolides .

Esterase formation is a mechanism of \nmacrolide resistance seen in coliforms . The answer is E. \n5. Cervidtis or urethritis is often caused by C trachomatis. Such \ninfections may devdop slowly because of the long incubation \nperiod of chlamydial infection. Treatment with oral doxycy\u00ad\ncline for 14 d (as originally prescribed) would have eradicated \nC 1rachomatis and most other organisms commonly associ\u00ad\nated with nongonococcal cervicitis or urethritis. Given the \nlimited compliance of this patient, the best course of action \nwould be the administration (in the clinic) of a single oral \ndose of azithromycin. The answer is C. \n6. This patient is in the high-risk category for bacterial endocar\u00ad\nditis and should receive prophylactic antibiotics before many \ndental procedures. The American Heart Association recom\u00ad\nmends that clindamycin be used in patients allergic to peni\u00ad\ncillins. Oral erythrornycin is not recommended because it is \nno more effective than clindamycin and causes more gastro\u00ad\nintestinal adverse effects. Intravenous vancomycin {not oral), \nsometimes with gcncamicin, is recommended for prophylaxis \nin high-risk penicillin-allergic patients undergoing genitouri\u00ad\nnary and lower gastrointestinal surgical procedures. Complete \ncross-allergenicity must be assumed between individual peni\u00ad\ncillins. The answer is B. \n7. It is often difficult to establish a definite cause of community\u00ad\nacquired pneumonia. More than 80% of cases are caused \nby typical pathogens such as S pneumoniae, H influenzae, or \nM cata\"haiis, and 15% are due to the nonzoonotic atypi\u00ad\ncal pathogens such as Legionella species, Mycop/asma species, \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: \nD Explain how these agents inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. or C pneumoniae. Currently, monotherapy coverage of both \ntypical and atypical pathogens in community-acquired pneu\u00ad\nmonia is preferred to double-drug therapy. Preferred initial \ntherapy includes a rnacrolide, doxycycline, or a quinolone \nactive against respiratory pathogens (see Chapter 46). Ampi\u00ad\ncillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin have low activity against \natypical pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia. \nThe answer is C. \n8. The inhibition of liver cytochrome P450 by erythromycin \nhas led to serious drug interactions. Although erythromycin \ndoes not inhibit loratadine metabolism, it does inhibit the \nCYP 1A2 form of cytochrome P450, which metabolizes meth\u00ad\nylxanthines. Consequently, cardiac and/or CNS toxicity may \noccur with excessive ingestion of caffeine. Unlike the tetracy\u00ad\nclines, the oral absorption of erythromycin is not affected by \ncations and the drug does not cause photosensitivity. Because \nerythromycin undergoes biliary excretion, there is little reason \nto assess renal function before treatment. The answer is C. \n9. Azithromycin has a half-life of more than 70 h, which allows \nfor once-daily dosing and a 5-d course of treatment for \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. Unlike other macrolides, \nazithromycin does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes \ninvolved in drug metabolism. The answer is A. \n10.

            "Text": "Alllinoglycosides & \nSpectinolllycin \nMODES OF ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION \nIn the antimicrobial treattnent of infections, multiple daily dosage \nregimens traditionally have been designed to maintain serum con\u00ad\ncentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC} for as \nlong as possible. However, the in vivo cffectiven~ of some antibiotics, \nincluding aminoglyc.osides, results from mna:ntration-depcndcnt \nkilling. As the plasma level increases above the MIC, aminoglyc.osides \nkill an increasing proportion of bacteria and at an increasingly rapid \nrate. Many other antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalospo\u00ad\nrins, cause time-dependent killing of microorganisms: their in vivo \nefficacy is directly related to time above MIC and is independent of \nroncentration once the MIC has been reached. \nAminoglycosidcs arc also capable of exerting a pwtantibiotic \neffect such that their killing action continues when their plasma \nlevels have declined below measurable levels. Consequently, ami\u00ad\nnoglycosides have greater efficacy when administered as a single \nlarge dose than when given as multiple smaller doses. The toxic\u00ad\nity (in contrast to the antibacterial efficacy) of aminoglycosides \ndepends both on a critical plasma concentration and on the time \nthat such a level is exceeded. The time above this threshold is \nshorter with a single large dose of an aminoglycoside than when \nmultiple smaller doses are given. These concepts form the basis for \nonce-daily aminoglycoside dosing protocols, which can be more \neffective and less toxic than traditional dosing regimens. \nPHARMACOKINETICS \nAminoglycosides have a hexose ring to which amino sugars are \nattached by glycosidic linkages. They arc polar compounds, not \nabsorbed after oral administration, and must be given intramuscu\u00ad\nlarly or intravenously for systemic effect. They have limited tissue \npenetration and do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Glo\u00ad\nmerular filtration is the major mode of elimination, and excretion \nof aminoglycosides is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. \nWith normal renal function, the elimination half-life of amino\u00ad\nglycosides is 2-3 h. Dosage adjustments must be made in renal \ninsufficiency to prevent toxic accumulation. Monitoring plasma \nlevels of aminoglyc.osidcs is important for safe and effective dosage C H A P T E R \nselection and adjustment. For traditional dosing regimens (2 or \n3 times daily), peak serum levels are measured 30-60 min after \nadministration and trough levels just before the next dose. With \nonce-daily dosing, peak levels are less important since they will \nnaturally be high. \nMECHANISM OF ACTION \nAminoglycosides are bactericidal inhibitors of protein synthesis. \nTheir penetration through the bacterial cell envelope requires \noxygen-dependent active transport, and they have minimal activ\u00ad\nity against strict anaerobes. Aminoglycoside entry can be enhanced \nby cell wall synthesis inhibitors, which may be the basis of antimi\u00ad\ncrobial synergism. Inside the cell, aminoglycosides bind to the 305 \nribosomal subunit and interfere with protein synthesis in at least \nthree ways: (1) they block formation of the initiation complex; (2) \nthey cause misreading of mRNA, causing incorporation of incor\u00ad\nrect peptides, yielding nonfunctional protein; and (3) they inhibit \ntranslocation (Figure 45-1). Aminoglycosides may also disrupt \npolysomal structure, resulting in nonfunctional monosomes. \nMECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE \nStreptococci, including Streptococcus pneu.moniae, and enterococci \nare relatively resistant to gentamicin and most other aminoglyco\u00ad\nsides owing to failure of the drugs to penetrate into the cell. How\u00ad\never, the primary mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides, \nespecially in gram-negative bacteria, involves the plasmid-mediated \nformation of inactivating enzymes. These enzymes are group \ntramfcrucs that catalyze the acetylation of amine functions and \nthe transfer of phosphoryl or adenylyl groups to the oxygen atoms \nof hydroxyl groups on the aminoglycoside. Individual arninogly\u00ad\nrosides have varying susceptibilities to such enzymes. For example, \ntransferases produced by cnterococci can inactivate amikacin, gen\u00ad\ntamicin, and tobramycin but not streptomycin. However, amikacin \nis often resistant to many enzymes that inactivate gentamicin and \ntobramycin. In addition, resistance to streptomycin, which is com\u00ad\nmon, appears to be due to changes in the ribosomal binding site. \n389"

Block of movement of the ribosome \nmay occur after the formation of a single initiation complex, resulting in an mRNA chain with only a single ribosome on it, a so-called \nmonosome. \nCLINICAL USES \nThe main differences among the individual aminoglycosides lie \nin their activities against specific organisms, particularly gram\u00ad\nnegative rods. Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are impor\u00ad\ntant drugs for the treatment of serious infections caused by aerobic \ngram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Enterobacter, \nKkbsiella, Proteus, Providencia, Pseutlomonas, and Se\"atia species. \nThese aminoglyrosides also have activity against strains of Haemophilus \ninjlumzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Shigella species, although they are \nnot drugs of ch.oic.e for infections caused by these organisms. When \nused alone, aminoglyrosides are not reliably effi:ctive in the treatment \nof infections caused by gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial synergy may \noccur when aminoglycosides are used in combination with beta-lactam \nantibiotics (cdl wall synthesis inhibitors). Examples include their com\u00ad\nbined use with penicillins in the treatment of pseudomonal, lisrerial, \nand enterococcal infections. \nThe indications for S}'5temic aminoglycoside monotherapy are \nlimited to tularemia and plague (streptomycin and gentamicin are \nfirst line agents), certain urinary tract infections (plazomicin and \namikacin), and Neisseria gono\"hea if the patient has a severe peni\u00ad\ncillin allergy (spectinomycin, not available in the United States). \nAminoglycosides are commonly used in combination with other \nagents for empiric therapy in cases of serious infection. Combina\u00ad\ntion therapy with gentamicin is frequently used in enterococcal \ncarditis. Combination therapy with aminoglycosides (eg, amikacin and streptomycin; kanamycin is not available in the United States) \nis a second-line treatment of tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant \nstrains of Mycohacterium tuberculosis that are resistant to strepto\u00ad\nmycin may be susceptible to ami.kacin. Because of the risk of oto\u00ad\ntoxicity, streptomycin should not be used when other drugs will \nserve. Owing to its toxic potential, neomycin is usually restricted to \ntopical or oral use (eg, to diminate bowel flora). Gentamicin is also \navailable for topical use. \nNetilmicin has been used for treatment of serious infections \ncaused by organisms resistant to the other aminoglycosides. N etil\u00ad\nmicin is no longer available in the United States. \nTOXICITY \nA. Ototoxlclty \nAuditory or vestibular damage (or both) may occur with any \naminoglycoside and may be irreversible. Auditory impairment is \nmore likdy with amikacin and kanamycin; vestibular dysfunction \nis more likely with streptomycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. \nOtotoxicity risk is proportional to the plasma levels, and thus is \nespecially high if dosage is not appropriately modified in a patient \nwith renal dysfunction. Ototoxicity may be increased by the use \nof loop diuretics. Because ototoxicity has been reported after fetal \nexposure, the aminoglycosides are contraindicated in pregnancy \nunless their potential benefits are judged to outweigh risk. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Nephrotoxicity \nRenal toxicity usually takes the form of acute tubular necrosis. \nThis adverse effect, which is often reversible, is more common in \nelderly patients and in those concurrently receiving furosemide, \nclindamycin, vancomycin, and others.

Which statement about \"once-daily\" dosing with aminogly\u00ad\ncosides is accurate? \n(A) Dose adjustment is important in renal dysfunction \n(B) The antibacterial action of aminoglycosides is time\u00ad\ndependent \n(C) Once the MIC is reached, bacteria are killed at a con\u00ad\nstant rate \n(D) Often more side effects than multiple daily dosing \nregimens \n(E) The antibacterial effect of aminoglycosides stops when \nplasma levels fall below the MIC \nANSWERS \n1. Aminoglycosides are bactericidal inhibitors of protein syn\u00ad\nthesis binding to specific components of the 30S ribosomal \nsubunit. Their actions include block of the formation of the \ninitiation complex, miscoding, and polysomal breakup. Pep\u00ad\ntidyl transferase is inhibited by chloramphenicol, not amino\u00ad\nglycosides. The answer is C. \n2. Monitoring plasma drug levels is important when ami\u00ad\nnoglycosides are used. In this case, the patient seems to be \nimproving, so a decrease of the amikacin dose in proportion \nto decreased creatinine clearance is most appropriate. Because \ncreatinine clearance is only one half of the starting value, a \ndose reduction should be made to one half of that given ini\u00ad\ntially. The answer is C. \n3. Aminoglycoside antibiotics act at the ribosomal level and their \nintracellular accumulation by bacteria is oxygen dependent. \nAnaerobic bacteria including B fragilis are innately resistant. \nAminoglycosides are often used with a cell wall inhibitor. Due \nto their polar nature they are not absorbed from the GI tract \nafter oral dosing. The answer is B. 4. The antibacterial action of aminoglycosides is concentration\u00ad\ndependent rather than time-dependent. The activity of amikacin \ncontinues to increase as its plasma level rises above the minimal \ninhibitory concentration (MIC). When the plasma levd falls \nbelow the MIC, aminoglycosides continue to exert antibacterial \neffects for several hours, exerting a postantibiotic effect. Inhibi\u00ad\ntors of bacterial cell wall synthesis often exen synergistic effects \nwith aminoglycosides, possibly by increasing the intracellular \naccumulation of the aminoglycoside. The answer is F.. \n5. The loading dose of any drug is calculated by multiplying \nthe desired plasma concentration (mg/L) by the volume of \ndistribution (L). The answer is D. \n6. The diabetic patient with external otitis is at special risk \nbecause of the danger of spread to the middle car and possibly \nthe meninges, so hospitalization is advisable, especially in the \nelderly. Likely pathogens include E coli and P aeruginosa, and \ncoverage must be provided fur these and possibly other gram\u00ad\nnegative rods. The combination of an aminoglycoside plus \na wider-spectrum penicillin is most suitable in this case and \nis synergistic against many pseudomonas strains. Imipenem\u00ad\ncilastatin is also possible, but resistant strains of P atruginosa \nhave emerged during treatment. Cefaclor lacks antipseudo\u00ad\nmonal activity. The answer is E. \n7. Gentamicin is the most nephrotoxic aminoglycoside. The inci\u00ad\ndence of nephrotoxic effects with gentamicin is 2 to 3 times \ngreater than the incidence of ototoxicity. With traditional \ndosage regimens, the first indication of potential nephrotox\u00ad\nicity is an increase in trough serum levels of aminoglycosides, \nwhich is followed by an increase in blood creatinine. Although \naminoglycoside ototoxicity usually involves irreversible effects \non vestibular function, hearing loss can also occur. Ototoxic\u00ad\nity is enhanced by loop diuretics. Skin reactions are common \nwith topical use of neomycin. The answer is B. \n8. Tobramycin is almost identical to gentamicin in both its phar\u00ad\nmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. However, fur rea\u00ad\nsons that are unclear, it is much less active than either gentamicin \nor streptomycin when used in combination with a penicillin in \nthe treatment of enterococcal endocarditis. The answer is F.. \n9. All of the listed drugs have been used for the treatment of \ngonorrhea. Cephalosporins should be avoided in patients \nwith a history of severe hypersensitivity to penicillins, and \nfluoroquinolones {sec Chapter 46) should be avoided in preg\u00ad\nnancy. Tetracyclines including doxycycline have been used in \nthe past for gonorrhea, but not as single doses, and they too \nshould be avoided in pregnancy. The answer is A. \n10. In \"once-daily dosing\" with aminoglycosides, the selection \nof an appropriate dose is panicularly critical in patients with \nrenal insufficiency. The aminoglycosides are eliminated by \nthe kidney in proponion to creatinine clearance. Knowledge \nof the degree of insufficiency, based on plasma creatinine (or \nblood urea nitrogen), is essential for estimation of the appro\u00ad\npriate single daily dose of an aminoglycoside. The answer is A. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: NEPHROTOXICITY \nDrugs with nephrotoxic potential Include ACE inhibitors, \nacetazolamide, aminoglycosides, aspirin, amphotericin B, \ncyclosporine, furosemide , gold salts, lithium, methicillin, \nmethoxyflurane, NSAIDs, pentamidine, sulfonamides , tetracy\u00ad\nclines (degraded), thiazides, and triamterene. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The sulfonamides may be classified as short\u00ad\nacting (cg, sulfUoU7.0le), intermediate-acting (cg, sulfametboxa\u00ad\nzole), and long-acting (cg, sulfadoxine).

Sulfonamides-The sulfonamides are bacteriostatic inhibi\u00ad\ntors of folic acid synthesis. As antimetabolites of P ABA, they are \ncompetitive inhibitors of dihydroptcroatc synthase (Figure 46-1). \nThey can also act as substrates for this enzyme, resulting in the syn\u00ad\nthesis of nonfunctional forms of folic acid.

Inhibition of 2 successive steps in the \nformation oftetrahydrofollc acid constitutes sequential blockade and \nresults in antibacterial synergy. of sulfonamides results from the inability of mammalian cells to \nsynthesize folic acid; mammals must obtain preformed folic acid \nin the diet. \n2. Trlmethoprlm- T rimethoprim is a selective inhibitor of bac\u00ad\nterial dihydrofolatc rcductasc that prevents formation of the active \ntetrahydro form of folic acid (Figure 46-1). Bacterial dihydrofo\u00ad\nlate reductase is 4-5 orders of magnitude more sensitive to inhibi\u00ad\ntion by trimcthoprim than the mammalian enzyme. \n3. Trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole-When the two \ndrugs are used in combination, antimicrobial synergy results from \nthe sequential blockade of folatc synthesis (Figure 46-1). The \ndrug combination is bactericidal against susceptible organisms. \nC. Resistance \nBacterial resistance to sulfonamides is common and may be plas\u00ad\nmid mediated. It can result from decreased intracdlular accumu\u00ad\nlation of the drugs, increased production of PABA by bacteria, \nor a decrease in the sensitivity of dihydropteroate synthase to the \nsulfonamides. Clinical resistance to trimethoprim most commonly \nresults from the production of dihydrofolatc rcductasc that has a \nreduced affinity for the drug. \nD. Clinical Use \n1. Sulfonamides- The sulfonamides are active against gram\u00ad\npositive and gram-negative organisms, Chlamydia, and Nocardia. \nWhile sulfonamides arc not commonly used as single agents, spe\u00ad\ncific members are used by the following routes for the conditions \nindicated: \na.

Sulfonamides can displace bilirubin from \nplasma proteins, with the risk of kernicterus in the neonate if used \nin the third trimester of pregnancy. \nF. Toxicity ofTrlmethoprlm \nTrimethoprim can cause the predictable adverse effects of an \nantifolace drug, including megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, and \ngranulocytopenia. These effects are usually ameliorated by supple\u00ad\nmentary folinic acid. The combination of TMP-SMZ may cause \nany of the adverse effects associated with the sulfonamides. AIDS \npatients given TMP-SMZ have a high incidence of adverse effects, \nincluding fever, rashes, leukopenia, and diarrhea. \nFLUOROQUINOLONES \nA. Classlflcatlon \nFluoroquinolones are classified by \"generation\" based on their \nantimicrobial spectrum of activity. Nor8oxadn (no longer avail\u00ad\nable in the United States), a first-generation fluoroquinolone \nderived from nalidixic acid, has activity against the common pathogens that cause urinary tract infections. Ciprofloxacin and \nofloxadn (second-generation fluoroquinolones) have greater activ\u00ad\nity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and are active against \nPseutlomonas species and agents of atypical pneumonia (H influmr.ae, \nM catarrhalis). Third-generation fluoroquinolones (lcvofioudn, \ngemifloxacin, and mcuifloxadn) are slightly less active than cip\u00ad\nrofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria but have \ngreater activity against gram-positive cocci, including Streptococcus \npneumoniae and some strains of enterococci and methicillin\u00ad\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Third-generation drugs \nare commonly referred to as \"respiratory fluoroquinolones.\" The \nmost recently introduced drugs (eg, gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin) \nare the broadest-spectrum fluoroquinolones introduced to date, \nwith enhanced activity against anaerobes. \nB. Pharmacokinetics \nAll the fluoroquinolones have good oral bioavailabilicy {antacids, \ncertain medications, and foods containing multivalent cations may \ninterfere) and penetrate most body tissues. However, norfloxacin \ndoes not achieve adequate plasma levels for use in most systemic \ninfections. Elimination of most fluoroquinolones is through the \nkidneys via active tubular secretion, which can be blocked by pro\u00ad\nbenecid. Dosage reductions are usually needed in renal dysfunc\u00ad\ntion except for moxifloxacin which is eliminated partly by hepatic \nmetabolism and also by biliary excretion. Use of moxifloxacin in \nurinary tract infections is not recommended. Half-lives of fluoro\u00ad\nquinolones are usually in the range of 3-8 h. \nC. Mechanism of Action \nThe fluoroquinolones interfere with bacterial DNA synthesis by \ninhibiting topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase), especially in gram\u00ad\nnegative organisms, and topoisomerase IV, especially in gram\u00ad\npositive organisms. They block the relaxation of supercoiled \nDNA that is catalyzed by DNA gyrase, a step required for normal \ntranscription and duplication. Inhibition of topoisomerase IV by \nfluoroquinolones interferes with the separation of replicated chro\u00ad\nmosomal DNA during cell division. Fluoroquinolones are usually \nbactericidal against susceptible organisms. Like aminoglycosides, \nthe fluoroquinolones exhibit postantibiotic effects, whereby bacte\u00ad\nrial growth continues to be inhibited even after the plasma con\u00ad\ncentration of the drug has fallen below the minimum inhibitory \nconcentration of the bacterium {see Chapter 45). \nD. Resistance \nResistance to second-generation fluoroquinolones has emerged \nrapidly, especially in Campylobaaer jejuni and gonococci, but \nalso in gram-positive cocci (eg, MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \nand Serratia species. Mechanisms of resistance include decreased \nintracellular accumulation of the drug via the production of effiux \npumps or changes in porin structure (in gram-negative bacte\u00ad\nria). Effiux mechanisms appear to be responsible for resistance in \nstrains of Mycobaaerium tubercu/,osis, S aureus, and S pneumoniae. \nChanges in the sensitivity of the target enzymes via point muta\u00ad\ntions in the antibiotic-binding regions are also established to con\u00ad\nfer resistance against specific fluoroquinolones.

Clinical Use \nFluoroquinolones are effective in the treatment of infections of the \ngenitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts caused by gram-negative \norganisms, including gonococci, E coli, Kkbsiel/a pneumoniae, C \njejuni, Enterobacter, P aeruginosa, Salmonella, and Shigel/a species. \nThey have been used widdy for respiratory tract, skin, and soft \ntissue infections, but their effectiveness is now variable because of \nthe emergence of resistance. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in single \noral doses have been used as alternatives to ceftriaxone or cefixime \nin gonorrhea, but they are not currently recommended because \nresistance is now common. Ofloxacin eradicates Chlamydia tra\u00ad\nchomatis, but a 7-d course of treatment is required. Levofloxacin \nhas activity against most organisms associated with community\u00ad\nacquired pneumonia, including chlamydiae, mycoplasma, and \nlegiondla species. Gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin have the wid\u00ad\nest spectrum of activity, which includes both gram-positive and \ngram-negative organisms, atypical pneumonia agents, and some \nanaerobic bacteria. Fluoroquinolones have also been used in the \nmeningococcal carrier state, in the treatment of tuberculosis, and \nin prophylactic management of neutropenic patients. \nF. Toxicity \nGastrointestinal distress is the most common adverse effect. The \nfluoroquinolones may cause skin rashes, headache, dizziness, \ninsomnia, abnormal liver function tests, phototoxicity, neurotox\u00ad\nicity, and both tendinitis and tendon rupture. Opportunistic \ninfections caused by C albicans and streptococci have occurred. \nThe fluoroquinolones are not recommended for children or preg\u00ad\nnant women because they may damage growing cartilage and cause \nanhropathy. Fluoroquinolones may increase the plasma levds of \ntheophylline and other methylxanthines, enhancing their toxicity. \nNewer fluoroquinolones (gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxa\u00ad\ncin) prolong the QTc interval. They should be avoided in patients \nwith known QTc prolongation and those taking certain antiar\u00ad\nrhythmic drugs (see Chapter 14) or other drugs that increase the \nQT c interval. \nSKILL KEEPER: PROLONGATION OF THE QT \nINTERVAL (SEE CHAPTER 14) \nGrepafloxacin was withdrawn from clinical use in the United \nStates because of serious cardiotoxicity.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxawle is not effective in the treat\u00ad\nment of infections caused by viruses, fungi, or mycobactcria. \nHowever, the drug combination is active against certain pro\u00ad\ntozoans, including Toxop/asma, and is the first-line therapy for the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected \npatients. The answer is D. \n2. The second-generation fluoroquinoloncs arc very effective in \ndiarrhea caused by bacterial gram-negative pathogens, includ\u00ad\ning E coli, Shigtlla, and Salmonella. None of the other drugs \nlisted would be appropriate. Many coliforms are now resis\u00ad\ntant to amoxicillin and ampicillin. Although trimethoprim \nis available as a single drug, resistance emerges rapidly dur\u00ad\ning treatment unless it is used for urinary tract infections, in \nwhich high concentrations can be achieved. Vancomycin has \nno activity against gram-negative bacilli. The answer is B. \n3. Reduced uptake of sulfonamides is one way organisms can \nbecome resistant. All of the other statements about sulfon\u00ad\namide antimicrobial drugs arc incorrect. The answer is E. \n4. Ccfixime in a single oral dose is effective in gonorrhea (sec \nChapter 43), but it has no activity against organisms causing \nnongonococcal urethritis. Spcctlnomycin (sec Chapter 45) is \nactive against most gonococci, but docs not eradicate a geni\u00ad\ntourinary chlamydia) infection. Although ciprofloxacin might \nbe effective in both gonorrhea and chlamydial urethritis, it is \nno longer recommended for treatment of gonorrhea in the \nUnited States, since resistance is now common. This patient \ncould be treated by single oral doses of ccfixime plus azithro\u00ad\nmycin (not listed). Sulfamcthoxazolc or TMP-SMZ would \nnot be useful and may cause acute hcmolysis in this patient. \nThe answer is E. \nS. Antacids can dtcrtast oral bioavailability of fluoroquinolones. \nNeither hepatic nor renal dysfunction is a contraindication to \nthe use of fluoroquinolones. Most fluoroquinolones undergo \nrenal elimination and dosage should be modiflcd with crcati\u00ad\nnine clearance <50 mUmin. Moxifloxacin elimination occurs \nmainly via the liver. The fluoroquinolones should not be used \nto treat uncomplicated first-time urinary tract infections in \nchildren because of possible effects on cartilage devdopmcnt. \nUncomplicated urinary tract infections in children are usually \ndue to a strain of E coli that is sensitive to many other drugs, \nincluding beta-lactam antibiotics . The answer is D. \n6. In the absence of any evidence pointing toward a definite \nmicrobial cause for the colitis in this patient, a drug that \ndecreases inflammation is indicated. Sulfasalazinc has sig\u00ad\nnificant anti-inflammatory action, and its oral use results in \nsymptomatic improvement in 50-75% of patients suffer\u00ad\ning from ulcerative colitis. The drug is also used for its anti\u00ad\ninflammatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis. The answer is D. \n7. Most individuals who get Pneumocystis pneumonia are immU:\u00ad\nnocompromiscd, and side effects of TMP-SMZ arc more \ncommonly seen in these patients. The most common adverse \neffect of the sulfonamides is a skin rash caused by hypersensi\u00ad\ntivity. The answer is E. \n8. Sulfadiazine and TMP~SMZ arc drugs of choice in noc:ardiosis. \nIn combination with pyrimcthaminc (an effective dihydrofo\u00ad\nlate rcductase inhibitor in protozoa), sulfadiazine is effective in \ntoxoplasmosis and is prophylactic against Pneumocystis pneu\u00ad\nmonia in the AIDS patient.

Trimethoprim is the only weak base listed (fluoroquinolones \nand sulfonamides are acidic compounds), and its high lipid \nsolubility at blood pH allows penetration of the drug into \nprostatic and vaginal fluid to reach levels similar to those in \nplasma.

Clinical uses-In the treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin is \nalmost always used in combination with other drugs. However, \nrifampin can be used as the sole drug in treatment oflatent tuber\u00ad\nculosis in !NH-intolerant patients or in close contacts of patients \nwith !NH-resistant strains of the organism. In leprosy, rifampin \ngiven monthly delays the emergence of resistance to dapsone. \nRifampin may be used with vancomycin for infections due to \nresistant staphylococci (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus \n[MRSA] strains) or pneumococci (penicillin-resistant Streptococcus \npneumoniae [PRSP] strains). Other uses of rifampin include the \nmeningococcal and staphylococcal carrier states. \n4. Toxicity and interactions-Rifampin colors sweat, urine, \nand tears orange. It is harmless, though contact lenses can be per\u00ad\nmanently stained. Rifampin commonly causes light-chain pro\u00ad\nteinuria and may impair antibody responses. Occasional adverse \neffects include skin rashes, thrombocytopenia, nephritis, and liver dysfunction. If given less than twice weekly, rifampin may cause \na flu-like syndrome and anemia. Rifampin strongly induces liver \ndrug-metabolizing enzymes and enhances the elimination rate of \nmany drugs, including anticonvulsants, contraceptive steroids, \ncyclosporine, ketoconazole, methadone, terbinafine, and warfarin. \n5. Other rilamycins-Rifabutin is equally effective as an anti\u00ad\nmycobacterial agent and is less likely to cause drug interactions \nthan rifampin. It is usually preferred over rifampin in the treat\u00ad\nment of tuberculosis or other mycobacterial infections in AIDS \npatients, especially those treated with cytochrome P450 substrates \nincluding protease inhibitors or efavirenz. Rifapentinc has kinet\u00ad\nics that allow for once-weekly dosing and can be used with INH \nfor treatment of latent infections. Ri&ximin, a rifampin derivative \nthat is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has been used \nin traveler's diarrhea. \nSKILL KEEPER: GENOTYPICVARIATIONS IN \nDRUG METABOLISM (SEE CHAPTERS 4 AND 5) \nGenotypic variants occur with regard to the metabolism \nof isoniazid. What other drugs exhibit such variation, and \nwhat enzymes are involved in their metabolism? What are \nthe clinical consequences of genetic polymorphisms in drug \nmetabolism? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nC. Ethambutol \n1. Mechan/sms-Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyltransferases \n(encoded by the embCAB operon) involved in the synthesis of ara\u00ad\nbinogalactan, a component of mycobacterial cell walls. Resistance \noccurs rapidly via mutations in the emb gene if the drug is used \nalone. \n2. Pharmacoklnetlcs-The drug is well absorbed orally and \ndistributed to most tissues, including the CNS. A large fraction is \neliminated unchanged in the urine. Dose reduction is necessary in \nrenal impairment. \n3. Clinical use-The main use of ethambutol is in tuberculosis, \nand it is always given in combination with other drugs. \n4. Toxicity- The most common adverse effects are dose-dependent \nvisual disturbances, including decreased visual acuity, red-green \ncolor blindness, optic neuritis, and possible retinal damage (from \nprolonged use at high doses). Most of these effects regress when \nthe drug is stopped. Other adverse effects include headache, con\u00ad\nfusion, hyperuricemia, and peripheral neuritis. \nD. Pyrazinamide \n1. Mechanisms-The mechanism of action of pyrazinamide is \nnot known; however, its bacteriostatic action appears to require \nmetabolic conversion via pyrazinamidases (encoded by the pncA \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "gene) present in M tuberculosis. Resistance occurs via mutations \nin the gene that encodes enzymes involved in the bioactivation of \npyrazinamide and by increased expression of drug cffiux systems. \nThis develops rapidly when the drug is used alone, but there is \nminimal cross-resistance with other antimycobacterial drugs. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-Pyrazinamide is well absorbed orally \nand penetrates most body tissues, including the CNS. The drug \nis partly metabolized to pyrazinoic acid, and both parent molecule \nand metabolite are excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life of \npyrazinamide is increased in hepatic or renal failure. \n3. Clinical use-The combined use of pyrazinamide with other \nantituberculous drugs is an important factor in the success of \nshort-course treatment regimens. \n4. Toxicity-Major adverse effects include malaise, gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal upset, arthralgia, and hepatotoxicity. Hyperuricemia occurs \ncommonly hut is usually asymptomatic. Other adverse effects are \nmyalgia, maculopapular rash, porphyria, and photosensitivity \nreactions. Pytazinamide should be avoided in pregnancy. \nE. Alternative Drugs \nSeveral drugs with antimycobacterial activity are used in cases that \nare resistant to first-line agents; they are considered second-line \ndrugs because they arc no more effective, and their toxicities are \noften more serious than those of the major drugs. \nAmikacin, streptomycin, or kanamycin (aminoglycosides, see \nChapter 45) are second-line treatments of certain drug-resistant \ntuberculosis and nontuberculous rnycobacterial infections. To \navoid emergence of resistance, these should always be used in com\u00ad\nbination drug regimens. \nLewfloudn and moxiflondn (fluoroquinolones, see Chapter 46) \nare often active against strains of M tuberculosis resistant to flrst\u00ad\nline agents. The fluoroquinolones should always be used in combi\u00ad\nnation regimens with two or more other active agents. \nEthionamidc is a congener of INH, but crosHesistance does \nnot occur if there is no inhA gene mutation. The major disadvan\u00ad\ntage of ethionamide is severe gastrointestinal irritation and adverse \nncurologic effects at doses needed to achieve effective plasma levels. \np-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is rarely used because primary \nresistance is common. In addition, its toxicity includes gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal irritation, peptic ulceration, hypersensitivity reactions, and \neffects on kidney, liver, and thyroid function. \nOther drugs of limited use because of their toxicity include \ncapreomycin (ototoxicity, renal dysfunction) and cyclO.terine \n(peripheral neuropathy , CNS dysfunction). \nBcdaquiline inhibits ATP synthase in mycobacteria. It is \napproved for tuberculosis resistant to both INH and rifampin. \nAdverse effects include QT prolongation, nausea, arthralgia, head\u00ad\nache, cardiotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. \nF. Antitubercular Drug Regimens \n1. Standard regimens-For empiric treatment of pulmonary \ntuberculosis (in most areas of <4% INH resistance), the WHO CHAPTER 47 Antimycobacterial Drugs 403 \nrecommends an initial, daily 4-drug \"intensive phase\" of INH, \nrifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months. If the \norganisms are fully susceptible (and the patient is HN negative), \npyrazinamide and ethambutol can then be discontinued and daily \ntreatment continued for a further 4 mo with a 2-drug regimen \n(\"continuation phase\"). \n2. Alternative regimens- The preferred alternative in cases of \nfully susceptible organisms in which regular DOT is difficult to \nachieve is an intermittent (5 or 7 x week) 4-drug intensive phase \nfollowed by a 3 x week 2-drug continuation phase. \n3. Resistance-If resistance to INH is higher than 7%, the con\u00ad\ntinuation phase should include ethambutol. Tuberculosis resistant \nonly to INH (the most common form of resistance) can be treated \nfor 6 months with a regimen of rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambu\u00ad\ntol, and levofloxacin. Multidrug-resistant organisms (resistant to \nboth INH and rifampin) should be treated with an intensive phase \nof, at minimum, 4 drugs to which the organism is susceptible (for \nat least 4 months), and a continuation phase of at minimum 2 \ndrugs (for at least 5 months). \nDRUGS FOR LEPROSY \nA. Sulfones \nDapsone (diaminodiphenylsulfune) remains the most active drug \nagainst M leprae. The mechanism of action of sulfunes involves inhi\u00ad\nbition of folic acid synthesis. Because of increasing reports of resis\u00ad\ntance, it is recommended that the drug be used in combinations with \nrifampin and/or clofuimine (see bdow). Treatment lasts 1-2 years. \nDapsonc can be given orally, penetrates tissues well, undergoes \nenterohepatic cycling, and is diminated in the urine, partly as acety\u00ad\nlated metabolites. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal \nirritation, fever, skin rashes, and methemoglobinemia. Hemolysis \nmay occur, especially in patients with G6PDH deficiency. \nAc:edapsone is a repository form of dapsone that provides \ninhibitory plasma concentrations for several months. In addition \nto its use in leprosy, dapsone is an alternative drug for the treat\u00ad\nment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in AIDS patients. \nB. Other Agents \nDrug regimens usually include combinations of dapsone with \nrifampin (or rifabutin, see prior discussion) with or without do\u00b7 \nfazimine. Clofazimine, a phenazine dye that may interact with \nDNA, causes gastrointestinal irritation and skin discoloration \nranging from red-brown to nearly black. \nDRUGS ACTIVE AGAINST \nNONTUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA \nNontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) were formerly known as \natypical mycobactcria.

Currently, clarithro\u00ad\nmycin or azithromycin with or without rifabutin is recommended \nfor primary prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts less th.an SO/ \n\u00b5L. Infections resulting from other nontuberculous mycobacteria \n(eg, M marinum, M u/cerans), though sometimes asymptomatic, \nmay be treated with the described antimycobacterial drugs (eg, \nethambutol, INH, rifampin) or other antibiotics (cg, amikacin, \ncephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or tetracyclines). \nQUESTIONS \n1. A 45-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency depart\u00ad\nment with fever, weight loss, and a productive cough. Chest \nx-ray shows right apical infiltrate and tuberculosis is suspected. \nHe is started on empiric isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyra\u00ad\nzinamide. The primary reason for the use of drug combina\u00ad\ntions in the treatment of this patient's tuberculosis is: \n(A) Delay or prevent the emergence of resistance \n(B} Ensure patient compliance with the drug regimen \n(C} Increase antibacterial activity synergistically \n(D) Provide prophylaxis against other bacterial infections \n(E) Reduce the incidence of adverse effects \nQuestions 2--5. A 21-year-old woman from Southeast Asia has \nbeen staying with family members in the United States for the last \n3 months and is looking after her sister's preschool children dur\u00ad\ning the day. Because she has difficulty with the English language, \nher sister escorts her to the emergency department of a local hos\u00ad\npital. She tells the staff that her sister has been feding very tired \nfor the last month, has a poor appetite, and has lost weight. The \npatient has been feeling somewhat better lately except for a cough \nthat produces a greenish sputum, sometimes specked with blood. \nWith the exception of rales in the left upper lobe, the physical \nexamination is unremarkable and she does not seem to be acutely \nill. Laboratory values show a white blood count of 12,000/\u00b5L and \na hematocrit of 33%. Chest x-ray film reveals an infiltrate in the \nleft upper lobe with a possible cavity. A Gram-stained smear of the \nsputum shows mixed flora with no dominance. An acid-fast stain \nreveals many thin rods of pinkish hue. A prdiminary diagnosis is \nmade of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum is sent to the laboratory \nfor culture. \n2. At this point, the most appropriate course of action is to \n(A) Hospitalize the patient and start treatment with 4 antitu\u00ad\nbercular drugs \n(B} Hospitalize the patient and stan treatment with rifampin \n(C} Prescribe INH for prophylaxis and send the patient home \nto await culture results \n(D) Provide no drugs and send the patient home to await \nculture results \n(E} Treat the patient with INH plus rifampin 3.

A 29-year old woman has developed several light patches of \nskin that have reduced touch and pain perception. In talc\u00ad\ning her past medical history, you find she had a pet arma\u00ad\ndillo when she was young. Given that some armadillos in the \nsouthern United States carry M kprae, you start her on a drug \nregimen to treat leprosy (Hansen disease). Why does the stan\u00ad\ndard treatment for leprosy require 2-3 antibiotics at the same \ntime? \n(A) It may reverse the nerve damage that occurred prior to \nthe diagnosis \n(B) Multidrug therapy will prevent transmission to an \nunborn baby during pregnancy \n(C) The length of treatment may promote development of \nantibiotic resistance by the bacteria \n(D) The woman will be able to live with her family and travel \nvia public transportation \n(E) None of the above \n10.

Although it is sometimes possible to achieve synergistic effects \nagainst mycobacteria with drug combinations , the primary \nreason for their use is to delay the emergence of resistance. \nThe answer is A. \n2. Despite the fact that this patient does not appear to be acutely \nill, she would in most cases be treated with 4 drugs that have \nactivity against M tuberculosis. This patient should be hos\u00ad\npitalized for several reasons, including potential difficulties \nwith compliance regarding the drug regimen and the fact \nthat young children arc in the home where she is living. The \nanswer is A. \n3. Sputum cultures will not be available for several weeks, and \nno information is available regarding drug susceptibility of \nthe organism at this stage. For optimum coverage, the initial \nregimen should include INH, ri.fiunpin, pyrazinamide, and \nethambutol. Streptomycin is a second-line agent with seri\u00ad\nous side effects and is not commonly used due to high levels \nof resistance. Likewise, amikacin and ciprofloxacin arc pos\u00ad\nsible agents for treatment of multidrug -rcsistant strains of \nM tuberculosis . Cydoserine, PAS, and rifabutin arc alternative CHAPTER 47 Antimycobacterial Drugs 405 \nsecond-line drugs that may be used in cases of failed response \nto more conventional agents. The answer is C. \n4. Fast acetylators may require higher doses of the drug than \nothers. Peripheral neuropathy caused by INH is due to pyri\u00ad\ndoxine deficiency. It is more common in the diabetic, mal\u00ad\nnourished, or AIDS patient and can be prevented by a daily \ndose of 25-50 mg of pyridoxinc. INH can inhibit mono\u00ad\namine oxidase type A and has caused tyramine reactions. \nHepatotoxicity is age-dependent , with an incidence of 0.3% \nin patients aged 21-35 years and greater than 2% in patients \nolder than 50 years. The answer is B. \n5. Rifampin induces the formation of several microsomal drug\u00ad\nmetabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 isoforms. \nThis action increases the rate of elimination of a number of \ndrugs, including anticoagulants , ketoconazole, methadone, \nand steroids that arc present in oral contraceptives. The phar\u00ad\nmacologic activity of these drugs can be reduced markedly in \npatients taking ri.fiunpin. The answer is E. \n6. Combinations of antibiotics are essential for suppression of \ndisease caused by MAC in the AIDS patient, and treatment \nshould be started before culture results are available. Although \nrifabutin is prophylactic against MAC bacteremia when it is \nused as sole therapy in active disease, resistant strains of the \norganism emerge rapidly. MAC is much less susceptible than \nM tubercuwsis to conventional antimycobacterial drugs. Cur\u00ad\nrently, the optimum regimen consists of a macrolide with eth\u00ad\nambutol. The answer is D. \n7. A basdine test of ocular (not auditory) function may be use\u00ad\nful before starting ethambutol. None of the drugs prescribed \nis associated with nephrotoxicity. Polyarthralgia is a com\u00ad\nmon adverse effect of pyrazinamide that was not prescribed \nin this case. Periodic tests of liver function may be advisable \nin younger patients who arc treated with INH plus ri.fiunpin, \nespecially if higher doses of these drugs arc used. Prophylaxis \nwith INH is advisable for all household members and very \nclose contacts of patients with active tuberculosis , especially \nyoung children. The answer is C. \n8. Arabinosyltransferase is inhibited by ethambutol (not strep\u00ad\ntomycin) and resistance involves alterations in the emb gene. \nOcular adverse effects of ethambutol are dose-dependent and \nusually reversible when the drug is discontinued. Thiamine is \nnot protective. There is minimal cross-resistance between pyr\u00ad\nazinamide and other antimycobacterial drugs. Pyrazinamide \nuniformly causes hyperuricemia, but this is not a reason to \nhalt therapy even though the drug may provoke gouty arthri\u00ad\ntis in susceptible persons. The answer is E. \n9. While rare, some armadillos are infected with M kprae that \ncan spread to humans. The bacteria are slow growing, so it \nis often difficult to find the infection source. Leprosy is not \npassed during pregnancy, or through sexual or casual contact. \nTreatment lasts 1-2 years and leprosy can be cured if treat\u00ad\nment is completed as prescribed, but it cannot reverse previ\u00ad\nous structural damage. Extended exposure to any antibiotic \ncan cause resistant bacteria to flourish, so a multidrug therapy \nis important to target bacteria that may be resistant to one \ndrug. The answer is C. \n10. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MOR-TB) is defined as \nresistance to 2 or more drugs (commonly both INH and \nri.fiunpin). All the risk factors arc rdevant. The answer is E."

They are selectively \ntoxic to fungi because they interact with or inhibit the synthesis \nof ergosterol, a sterol unique to fungal cell membranes. \nDrugs acting on fungi \nAlter cell Block beta-glucan Block nucleic Disrupt \nmembrane permeability synthesis acid synthesis microtubule functions \n_I _I \nAzoles Polyenes Terbinafine Echinocancins Flucytosine Griseofulvin \nDRUGS FOR SYSTEMIC FUNGAL \nINFECTIONS \nA. Amphoterlcln B \nAmphotericin B continues to be an important drug for the treat\u00ad\nment of systemic fungal infections. However, several azoles and \nechinocandins are proving to be just as effective in some systemic \nmycoses with less risk of toxic effects. \nf. Classification and pharmacokinetics-Amphotericin B is \na polyene antibiotic related to nystatin. Amphotericin is poorly \nabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is usually adminis\u00ad\ntered intravenously as a nonlipid colloidal suspension, as a lipid \ncomplex, or in a liposomal formulation. The drug is widely dis\u00ad\ntributed to all tissues except the central nervous system (CNS). \nElimination is mainly via slow hepatic metabolism; the half-life is \napproximately 2 weeks. A small fraction of the drug is excreted in \nthe urine; dosage modification is necessary only in extreme renal \ndysfunction. Amphotericin B is not dialyzable. \n408 2. Mechanism of action-The fungicidal action of ampho\u00ad\ntericin B is due to its effects on the permeability and transport \nproperties of fungal membranes. Polyenes are molecules with both \nhydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics (ie, they are amphipa\u00ad\nthic). They bind to ergosterol, a sterol specific to fungal cell mem\u00ad\nbranes, and cause the formation of artificial pores (Figure 48-1). \nResistance, though uncommon, can occur via a decreased level of \nor a structural change in membrane ergosterol. \n3. Clinical uses-Amphotericin B has a wide antifungal spec\u00ad\ntrum and remains the drug of choice, or codrug of choice, for \nmost severe systemic infections caused by AspergiUus, Blastomyces, \nCandida albicam, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, and Mucor. Due to \nsignificant toxicities, amphotericin B is usually reserved for the \ntreatment of severe, invasive infections. It is usually given by slow \nintravenous infusion, but in fungal meningitis intrathecal admin\u00ad\nistration, though dangerous, has been used. Local administration \nof the drug, with minimal toxicity, has been used in treatment of \nmycotic corneal ulcers and keratitis. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Infusion related-Adverse effects related to intravenous infu\u00ad\nsion commonly include fever, chills, muscle spasms, vomiting, and \na shock-like fall in blood pressure. These effects may be attenuated \nby a slow infusion rate and by premedication with antihistamines, \nantipyretics, meperidine, or glucocorticoids. \nb. Dose-limiting nephrotoxicity-Amphotericin B decreases \nthe glomerular filtration rate and causes renal tubular acidosis \nwith magnesium and potassium wasting. Anemia may result from \ndecreases in the renal formation of erythropoietin. Although con\u00ad\ncomitant saline infusion may reduce renal damage, the nephro\u00ad\ntoxic effects of the drug are dose-limiting. Dose reduction (with \nlowered toxicity) is possible in some infections when amphotericin \nB is used with flucytosine. Liposomal formulations of ampho\u00ad\ntericin B have reduced nephrotoxic effects, possibly because of \ndecreased binding of the drug to renal cells. \nc. Neurotoxicity-Intrathecal administration of amphocericin \nB may cause seizures, neurologic damage, and the development \nof arachnoiditis. \nB. Flucytosine (5-Fluorocytosine) \n1. Classification and pharmacokinetics-5-FC is a pyrimi\u00ad\ndine antimetabolite related to the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil \n(5-FU). It is effective orally and is distributed to most body tissues, \nincluding the CNS. The drug is eliminated intact in the urine, and \nthe dose must be reduced in patients with renal impairment. 2. Mechanism of actlon-Flucytosine is accumulated in fun\u00ad\ngal cells by the action of a membrane permease and converted by \ncytosine deaminase to 5-FU, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase \n(Figure 48-1). Selective toxicity occurs because mammalian cells \nhave low levels of permease and deaminase. Resistance can occur \nrapidly if flucytosine is used alone and involves decreased activ\u00ad\nity of the fungal permeases or deaminases. When 5-FC is given \nwith amphotericin B (eg, in cryptococcal meningitis), or triazoles \nsuch as itraconazole (eg, in chromoblastomycosis), emergence of \nresistance is decreased and synergistic antifungal effects may occur. \n3. Clinical uses-The antifungal spectrum of 5-FC is narrow; its \nclinical use is limited to the treatment, in combination with ampho\u00ad\ntericin B or a triazole, of infections resulting from Cryptococcus \nneoformans, possibly systemic candidal infections, and chroma~ \nblastomycosis caused by molds. \n4. Toxicity-Prolonged high plasma levels of flucytosine cause \nreversible bone marrow depression and liver dysfunction. \nC. Azole Antifungal Agents \n1. Classification and pharmacokinetics-The azoles used for \nsystemic mycoses include ketoconamle, an imidazole, and the tri\u00ad\nazoles fluconazole, itraconazole, pmaconazole, isavuconazole, \nand voriconazole.

            "Text": "410 PART VIII Chemotherapeutic Drugs \nvoriconazole are more reliably absorbed via the oral route than the \nother azoles. Most triazoles are available in both oral and intrave\u00ad\nnous formulations. The drugs are distributed to most body tis\u00ad\nsues, but with the exception of fluconazole, drug levels achieved \nin the CNS are very low. Liver metabolism is responsible for the \nelimination of ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and vori\u00ad\nconazole. Inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes {eg, rifampin) \ndecrease the bioavailability of itraconazole. Fluconazole is elimi\u00ad\nnated by the kidneys, largely in unchanged form. \n2. Mechanism of action-The azoles interfere with fungal cell \nmembrane permeability by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol. \nThese drugs act at the step of l 4a-demethylation of lanosterol, \nwhich is catalyzed by a fungal cytochrome P450 isozyme. With \nincreasing use of azole antifungals, especially for long-term pro\u00ad\nphylaxis in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients, resis\u00ad\ntance is occurring, possibly via changes in the sensitivity of the \ntarget enzymes. \n3. Clinical uses \na. Ketoconazole-Because it has a narrow antifungal spectrum \nand causes more adverse effects than other azoles, ketoconazole is \nused for the treatment of susceptible blastomycosis, histoplasmo\u00ad\nsis, coccidioidomycosis, and chromomycosis only in patients who \ncannot take other antifungal therapies. The drug is not available \nin parenteral form. \nb. Fluconazole-Fluconazole is a drug of choice in esophageal \nand oropharyngeal candidiasis and for most infections caused by \nCoccidioides. A single oral dose usually eradicates vaginal candidia\u00ad\nsis. Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treatment and secondary \nprophylaxis against cryptococcal meningitis and is an alternative \ndrug of choice {with amphotericin B) in treatment of active disease \ndue to C neoformans. The drug is also equivalent to amphotericin \nB in candidemia. \nc. ltraconazole- This azole is available for oral or intravenous \nadministration and is currently the drug of choice for systemic \ninfections caused by Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Sporothrix. \nItraconazole is an alternative agent in the treatment of infections \ncaused by Aspergi/lus, Coccidioides, and Cryptococcus. In esophageal \ncandidiasis, the drug is active against some strains resistant to flu\u00ad\nconazole. ltraconazole is also used extensively in the treatment of \ndermatophytoses, especially onychomycosis. \nd. Vorlconazole-Voriconazole is available for oral and intra\u00ad\nvenous use and has a wider spectrum of fungal activity than itra\u00ad\nconazole. It is a treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis; some \nstudies report greater efficacy than amphotericin B. Voriconazole \nis an alternative drug in candidemia with activity against some flu\u00ad\nconazole-resistant organisms, and in AIDS patients has been used \nin the treatment of candidal esophagitis and stomatitis. \ne. Posaconazole-The broadest-spectrum triazole, posacon\u00ad\nazole has activity against most species of Candida and Aspergillus, \nis one of the agents active against mucormycosis, and is used for \nprophylaxis of fungal infections during cancer chemotherapy and \nin salvage therapy in invasive aspergillosis. f. lsavuconazole-Isavuconazole is a triazole with an antifungal \nspectrum similar to posaconazole. Preliminary evidence suggests it \nis better tolerated than posaconazole. \n4. Toxicity-Adverse effects of the azoles include vomiting, diar\u00ad\nrhea, rash, and sometimes hepatotoxicity, especially in patients \nwith preexisting liver dysfunction. Ketoconazole is a notorious \ninhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes and may increase \nthe plasma levels of many other drugs, including cyclosporine, \noral hypoglycemics, phenytoin, and warfarin. Inhibition of cyto\u00ad\nchrome P450 isoforms by ketoconazole interferes with the synthe\u00ad\nsis of adrenal and gonadal steroids and may lead to gynecomastia, \nmenstrual irregularities, and infertility. The other azoles are more \nselective inhibitors of fungal cytochrome P450. Although they are \nless likely than ketoconazole to cause endocrine dysfunction, their \ninhibitory effects on liver drug-metabolizing enzymes have resulted \nin drug interactions. Voriconazole causes immediate but transient \nvisual disturbances including blurring of vision of unknown cause \nin more than 30% of patients. Based on animal studies voricon\u00ad\nazole is a class D drug in terms of pregnancy risk. Visual dysfunc\u00ad\ntion has not been reported with posaconazole, but the drug is an \ninhibitor of CYP3A4, increasing the levels of cyclosporinc and \ntacrolimus. \nSKILL KEEPER: INHIBITORS OF CYTOCHROMES \nP450 (SEE CHAPTERS 4 AND 62) \nKetoconazole has the unenviable reputation of association \nwith multiple drug interactions because of its inhibition of \ncytochromes P450 involved in drug metabolism. \n1. List drugs that are metabolized by enzymes inhibited by \nketoconazole. \n2. List other drugs that inhibit hepatic cytochromes P450. \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nD. Echlnocandlns \n1. Classification and pharmacolclnetlcs--Cupofungin is \nan echinocandin, the first of a novel class of antifungal agents. \nNewer echinocandins include anidulafungin and micafungin. \nUsed intravenously, the drugs distribute widely to the tissues and \nare diminated largely via hepatic metabolism. Caspofungin has a \nhalf-life of 9-11 h, micafungin a half-life of 11-15 h, and anidu\u00ad\nlafungin a half-life of24-48 h. \n2. Mechanism of action-The echinocandins have a unique \nfungicidal action, inhibiting the synthesis of P{l-3)-glucan, a criti\u00ad\ncal component of fungal cell walls. \n3. Clinical uses-Echinocandins are used in the treaunent of \nesophageal and invasive candidiasis, and in empiric antifungal \ntherapy. Caspofungin is also used for invasive aspergillosis in \npatients over 3 months of age who fail to respond to other therapies \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "(eg, amphotericin B). Micafungin is also used for prophylaxis of \nCandiJa infections in bone marrow transplant patients. \n4. Tox/clty-Echinocandins are well tolerated. Hepatotoxicity \nand infusion-related effects have been reported rarely, and fever \nis more common with caspofungin use. Other side effects include \nheadache, gastrointestinal distress, fever, rash, and flushing (his\u00ad\ntamine release). Micafungin also causes histamine release and ele\u00ad\nvates blood levels of the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine \nand sirolimus. Combined use of echinocandins with cyclosporine \nmay elevate liver transaminases. \nSYSTEMIC DRUGS FOR \nMUCOCUTANEOUSFUNGAL \nINFECTIONS \nDrugs used orally in the treatment of dermatophytoses include \ngriseofulvin, terbinaflne, and several azole antifungals. \nA. Grlseofulvln \n1. Pharmacokinetics-Oral absorption of griseofulvin depends \non the physical state of the drug-ultra-micro-size formula\u00ad\ntions, which have finer crystals or particles, are more effectively \nabsorbed-and is aided by high-fat foods. The drug is distributed \nto the stratum corneum, where it binds to keratin. Biliary excre\u00ad\ntion is responsible for its elimination. \n2. Mechanism of action-Griseofulvin interferes with microtu\u00ad\nbule function in dermatophytes and may also inhibit the synthesis \nand polymerization of nucleic acids. Sensitive dermatophytes take \nup the drug by an energy-dependent mechanism, and resistance \ncan occur via decrease in this transport. Griseofulvin is fungistatic. \n3. Clinical uses and toxicity-Griseofulvin is not active topi\u00ad\ncally. The oral formulation of the drug is indicated for dermatophy\u00ad\ntoscs of the skin and hair that arc not adequately treated by topical \ntherapy. Adverse effects include headaches, mental confusion, \ngastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity, and changes in liver \nfunction. Griseofulvin should not be used in patientswith porphyria. \nGriseofulvin decreases the bioavailability of warfarin, resulting \nin decreased anticoagulant effect, and it also causes disulflram\u00ad\nlike reactions with ethanol. \nB. Terbinafine \nf. Mechanism of action- Terbinaflne and naftifine inhibit \na fungal enzyme, squalcne epoxidase (Figure 48-1). This causes \naccumulation of toxic levels of squalene, which can interfere with \nergosterol synthesis. Tcrbinaflne is fungicidal. \n2. Clinical uses and toxicity- T erbinaflne is available in both \noral and topical forms. Like griseofulvin, terbinaflne accumulates \nin keratin, but it is much more effective than griseofulvin in ony\u00ad\nchomycosis. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal upsets, rash, \nheadache, and taste disturbances. T erbinaflne does not inhibit \ncytochrome P450. CHAPTER48 AntifungalAgents 411 \nC.Azoles \nThe azoles other than voriconazole and posaconazolc are com\u00ad\nmonly used orally for the treatment of dermatophytoses. Pulse or \nintermittent dosing with itraconazole is as effective in onychomy\u00ad\ncoses as continuous dosing because the drug persists in the nails \nfor several months. Typically, treatment for 1 week is followed by \n3 weeks without drug. Advantages of pulse dosing include a lower \nincidence of adverse effects and major cost savings. Topical forms \nof various azoles are also available for use in dermatophytoses. \nTOPICAL ANTI FUNGAL THERAPY \nA number of antifungal drugs are used topically for superficial \ninfections caused by C albicans and dermatophytes. Nystatin is a \npolyene antibiotic (toxicity precludes systemic use) that disrupts \nfungal membranes by binding to ergosterol. Nystatin is commonly \nused topically to suppress local Candida infections and has been \nused orally to eradicate gastrointestinal fungi in patients with \nimpaired defense mechanisms. Other topical antifungal agents \nthat are widely used include the azole compounds miconazole, \ndotrimazole, and several others. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

The polyene antifungal drugs amphotericin B and nystatin \nare amphipathic molecules that can interact with ergosterol in \nfungal cell membranes to form artificial pores. In these struc\u00ad\ntures, the lipophilic groups on the drug molecule are arranged \non the outside of the pore, and the hydrophilic regions are \nlocated on the inside. The fungicidal action of the polyenes \nderives from this interaction, which results in leakage of intra\u00ad\ncellular constituents. The answer is D. \n2. The classes of antifungal drugs that have activity against \nCryptococcus are the polyenes (amphotericin B formulations), \nthe azoles, and flucytosine. Fluconazole is the best-absorbed \nmember of the azole group and the only one that readily pen\u00ad\netrates into cerebrospinal fluid. Amphotericin would work if \nit were delivered intrathecally. The answer is B. \n3. The antibiotic regimen should be stopped immediately, since \nthe condition of the patient did not improve after 3 days of \nsuch treatment, the cultures were negative for bacteria, and \nthe clinical picture suggested that the patient had a fungal \ninfection. This was subsequently confirmed by blood culture. \nThe answer is D. \n4. Infusion-related adverse effects of amphotericin B include chills \nand fevers (the \"shake and bake\" syndrome), muscle spasms, \nnausea, headache, and hypotension. Analgesic-antipyretics, \nantihistamines, and glucocorticoids all have been shown to be \nhelpful. The administration of a 1-mg test dose of ampho\u00ad\ntericin B is sometimes useful in predicting the severity of \ninfusion-related toxicity. The answer is D. \n5. In the case of opportunistic candidal infections in the immu\u00ad\nnocompromised patient, no prophylactic drugs have been \nshown to be clinically effective. Prophylaxis against other \nfungi may be effective in some instances, including suppres\u00ad\nsion of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients with fluco\u00ad\nnazole. However, prophylactic use of azoles may contribute to \nthe development of fungal resistance. The answer is E. \n6. A travel history can be important in the diagnosis of fungal \ndisease. If this patient has a fungal infection of the lungs, it is \nprobably due to C immitis, which is endemic in dry regions \nof the western United States. Pulmonary symptoms of coc\u00ad\ncidioidomycosis are usually self-limiting, and drug therapy \nis not commonly required in an otherwise healthy patient. \nTender red nodules on extensor surfaces constitute a good \nprognostic sign.

Such strains are cross\u00ad\nresistant to famciclovir, ganciclovir, and valacyclovir. \n2. Pharmacoldnetics-Acyclovir can be administered by the \ntopical, oral, and intravenous routes. Because of its short half\u00ad\nlife, oral administration requires multiple daily doses of acyclovir. \nRenal excretion is the major route of elimination of acyclovir, and \ndosage should be reduced in patients with renal impairment. \n3.

Yalacyclovir has a longer dura\u00ad\ntion of action than acyclovir. Penciclovir undergoes activation by \nviral thymidine kinase, and the triphosphate form inhibits DNA \npolymerase but does not cause chain termination. Famcidovir is \na prodrug converted to penciclovir by first-pass metabolism in the \nliver. Used orally in genital herpes and for herpes zoster, famci\u00ad\nclovir is well tolerated and is similar to acyclovir in its pharma\u00ad\ncokinetic properties. None of the acyclovir congeners has activity \nagainst TIC strains of HSY. Docosanol is an aliphatic alcohol \nthat inhibits fusion between the HSY envelope and plasma mem\u00ad\nbranes. It prevents viral entry and subsequent replication. Used \ntopically, docosanol shortens healing time. \nB. Letermovlr \nLetermovir' s antiviral activity is highly specific to CMV and is \ncurrently the most active molecule against CMV. It inhibits the \nterminase complex required for DNA packaging and processing. \nIt is approved for oral or intravenous use in CMV prophylaxis in \npatients receiving stem cell transplants. \nC. Ganciclovir \n1. Mechanisms-Ganciclovir, a guanine derivative, is triphos\u00ad\nphorylated to form a nucleotide that inhibits DNA polymerases \nof CMV and HSY and causes chain termination. The first phos\u00ad\nphorylation step is catalyzed by virus-specific enzymes in both \nCMY-infected and HSY-infected cdls. CMV resistance mecha\u00ad\nnisms involve mutations in the genes that code for the activating \nviral phosphotransferase and the viral DNA polymerase. Thymi\u00ad\ndine kinase-deficient HSY strains are resistant to ganciclovir. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-Ganeiclovir is usually given intrave\u00ad\nnously and penetrates well into tissues, including the eye and the CHAPTER 49 Antiviral Agents 417 \ncentral nervous system (CNS}. The drug undergoes renal elimina\u00ad\ntion in direct proponion to creatinine clearance. Oral bioavailabil\u00ad\nity is less than 10%. An intraocular implant form of ganciclovir \ncan be used in CMY retinitis. Yalganciclovir, a prodrug of gan\u00ad\nciclovir, has high oral bioavailability and has decreased the use of \nintravenous forms of ganciclovir (and also of intravenous cidofovir \nand foscarnet} in end-organ CMY disease. \n3. Clinical uses and toxicity-Ganciclovir is used for the pro\u00ad\nphylaxis and treatment of CMY retinitis and other CMY infec\u00ad\ntions in immunocompromised patients. Systemic toxic effects \ninclude leukopenia, thrombocyropenia, mucositis, hepatic dys\u00ad\nfunction, and seizures. The drug may cause severe neutropenia \nwhen used with zidovudine or other mydosuppressive agents. \nD. Cidofovir and Brincidofovir \n1. Mechanisms and pharmacokinetics-Cidofovir is a phos\u00ad\nphonate and is activated exclusively by host cell kinases. The active \ndiphosphate inhibits DNA polymerases of HSY, CMV, adeno\u00ad\nvirus, and human papillomavirus (HPV}. Because phosphoryla\u00ad\ntion does not require viral kinase, cidofovir is active against many \nacyclovir and ganciclovir-resistant strains. Resistance is due to \nmutations in the DNA polymerase gene. The drug is given intra\u00ad\nvenously and undergoes renal elimination. Dosage should be \nadjusted in proportion to creatinine clearance and full hydration \nmust be maintained. Brincidofovir is a cidofovir prodrug with \nactivity against HSY, CMY, adenovirus, BK virus, ebolavirus, and \npoxvirus. It appears to have less nephrotoxicity than cidofovir. \n2. Clinical uses and taxicity-Cidofovir is effective in CMY \nretinitis, in mucocutaneous HSY infections, including those \nresistant to acyclovir, and in genital warts. Nephrotoxicity is the \nmajor dose-limiting toxicity of cidofovir, additive with other \nnephrotoxic drugs including amphotericin B and aminoglycoside \nantibiotics. \nE. Foscarnet \n1. Mechanisms-Foscamet is a phosphonoformate derivative that \ndoes not require phosphorylation for antiviral activity. Although it \nis not an antimetabolite, foscarnet inhibits viral RNA polymerase, \nDNA polymerase, and HN reverse transcriptase. Resistance \ninvolves point mutations in the DNA polymerase gene. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-Foscarnet is given intravenously and \npenetrates well into tissues, including the CNS. The drug under\u00ad\ngoes renal elimination in direct proportion to creatinine clearance. \n3. Clinical uses and toxicity- The drug is an alternative for \nprophylaxis and treatment of CMY infections, including CMY \nretinitis, and has activity against ganciclovir-resistant strains of \nthis virus. Foscarnet inhibits herpes DNA polymerase in acyclovir\u00ad\nresistant strains that are thymidine kinase-deficient and may sup\u00ad\npress such resistant herpetic infections in patients with AIDS."

Other Antiherpes Drugs \n7. Vidarabine-Vidarabine is an adenine analog and has activity \nagainst HSY, VZV, and CMV. Its use for systemic infections is \nlimited by rapid metabolic inactivation and marked toxic poten\u00ad\ntial. Vidarabine is used topically for herpes keratitis but has no \neffect on genital lesions. Toxic effects with systemic use include GI \nirritation, paresthesias, tremor, convulsions, and hepatic dysfunc\u00ad\ntion. Vidarabine is teratogenic in animals. \n2. ldoxurldlne and trltlurldlne-These pyrimidine analogs are \nused topically in herpes keratitis (HSV-1). They arc too toxic for \nsystemic use. \n3. Fomivirsen-Fomivirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that \nbinds to mRNA of CMV, inhibiting early protein synthesis. The \ndrug is injected intravitreally for treatment of CMV retinitis. \nCross-resistance between fomivirsen and other anti-CMV \nagents has not been observed. Concurrent systemic anti-CMV \ntherapy is recommended to protect against extraocular and con\u00ad\ntralateral retinal CMV disease. Fomivirsen causes iritis, vitreitis, \nincreased intraocular pressure and changes in vision. \nANTI-HIV DRUGS \nThe primary drugs effective against HIV are antimetabolite inhibi\u00ad\ntors of viral reverse transcriptase and inhibitors of viral aspartate \nprotease (Table 49-2). The current approach to treatment of \ninfection with HIV is the initiation of treatment with three or \nmore antiretroviral drugs, if possible, before symptoms appear. \nTABLE 49-2 Majorantiretroviral drugs. \nSubclms \nNucleoslde reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors \nNonnucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors \nProtease Inhibitors \nCCR-5 antagonist \nFusion inhibitor Prototype \nZldovudlne \nDelavirdine \nlndlnavlr \nMaraviroc \nEnfuvirtide Other Significant \nAg.ms \nAbacavlr, dldanoslne, \nemtricitabine, lami\u00ad\nvudfne, stavudfne, \nzalcitabine \nEfavirenz. etravirine, \nnevirapine, rilpivirine, \ntenofovfr \nAmprenavlr, atazanavlr, \ndarunavir, lopinavir, nel\u00ad\nfinavir, ritonavir, saqui\u00ad\nnavir, tipranavir Such combinations usually include nucleoside reverse transcrip\u00ad\ntase inhibitors (NRTis) together with inhibitors of HIV prote\u00ad\nase (PI). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) involving \ndrug combinations can slow or reverse the increases in viral RNA \nload that normally accompany progression of disease. In many \nAIDS patients, HAART slows or reverses the decline in CD4 cells \nand decreases the incidence of opportunistic infections. \nDrug management of HIV infection is subject to change. \nUpdated recommendations can be obtained at the following web\u00ad\nsites: HIVinfo, http://hivinfo.nih.gov; and NPIN, https://npin \n.cdc.gov. \nA. Nucleoslde Reverse Transcrlptase Inhibitors \nTo convert their RNA into dsDNA, retroviruses require virally \nencoded RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). \nMammalian RNA and DNA polymerases are sufficiently distinct \nto permit a selective inhibition of the viral reverse transcriptase. \nNRTls are prodrugs converted by host cdl kinases to triphos\u00ad\nphates, which not only competitivdy inhibit binding of natural \nnucleotides to the dcoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)\u00ad\nbinding site of reverse transcriptasc but also act as chain termi\u00ad\nnators via their insertion into the growing DNA chain. Because \nNRTis lack a 3'-hydroxyl group on the ribose ring, attachment of \nthe next nucleotide is impossible. Resistance emerges rapidly when \nNRTis are used as single agents via mutations in the pol gene; \ncross-resistance occurs but is not complete. \n1. Abacavir-A guanosine analog, abacavir has good oral bio\u00ad\navailability and an intracellular half-life of 12-24 h. HIV resis\u00ad\ntance requires several concomitant mutations and tends to develop \nslowly. Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally fatal, occur in 5% \nof HIV patients. \n2. Didanosine (ddl)-Oral bioavailability of ddI is reduced \nby food and by chdating agents. The drug is diminated by the \nkidney, and the dose must be reduced in patients with renal dys\u00ad\nfunction. Pancreatitis is dose-limiting and occurs more frequently \nin alcoholic patients and those with hypertriglyceridcmia. Other \nadverse effects include peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, hepatic \ndysfunction, hyperuricernia, and CNS effects. \n3. Emtricitabine-Good oral bioavailability and renal dimina\u00ad\ntion with long half-life permit once-daily dosing of emtricitabine. \nBecause of the propylene glycol in the oral solution, the drug is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy and young children and in patients \nwith hepatic or renal dysfunction. Common adverse effects of the \ndrug include asthenia, GI distress, headache, and hyperpigmcnta\u00ad\ntion of the palms and/or the soles. \n4. Lamlvudlne (3TC)-Lamivudinc is 80% bioavailablc by the \noral route and is eliminated almost exclusively by the kidney. In \naddition to its use in HAART regimens for HIV, lamivudine is also \neffective in hepatitis B infections. Dosage adjustment is needed \nin patients with renal insufficiency. Adverse effects of lamivudinc \nare usually mild and include GI distress, headache, insomnia, and \nfatigue. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Peripheral neuropathy is \ndose-limiting and increased with coadministration of didanosine \nor zalcitabine. Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis occurs more \nfrequently with stavudine than with other NRTis. \n6. Tenofovir-Although it is a nucleotide, tenofovir acts like \nNRTis to competitivdy inhibit reverse transcriptase and cause \nchain termination after incorporation into DNA Tenofovir also \nhas activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) (see bdow). Oral bio\u00ad\navailability of tenofovir is in the 25-40% range, the intracellular \nhalf-life is more than 60 h, and the drug undergoes renal elimi\u00ad\nnation. T enofovir may impede the renal elimination of acyclovir \nand ganciclovir. Adverse effects include GI distress, asthenia, and \nheadache; rare cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome \nhave been reponed. \n7. Zalcitobine (ddCJ-Zalcitabine has a high oral bioavailability. \nDosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal insufficiency \nand nephrotoxic drugs (eg, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides) \nincrease toxic potential. Dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy is \nthe major adverse effect of ddC. Pancreatitis, esophageal ulcer\u00ad\nation, stomatitis, and arthralgias may also occur. \n8. Zidovudine (ZDV)-Formerly called azidothymidine (AZT), \nzidovudine is active orally and is distributed to most tissues, \nincluding the CNS. Elimination of the drug involves both hepatic \nmetabolism to glucuronides and renal excretion. Dosage reduction \nis necessary in uremic patients and those with cirrhosis. The pri\u00ad\nmary toxicity of zidovudine is bone marrow suppression (additive \nwith other immunosupprcssive drugs) leading to anemia and ncu\u00ad\ntropenia, which may require transfusions. GI distress, thrombocy\u00ad\ntopenia, headaches, myalgia, acute cholestatic hepatitis, agitation, \nand insomnia may also occur. Drugs that may increase plasma lev\u00ad\nels of zidovudine include azole antifungals and protease inhibitors. \nRifampin increases the clearance of zidovudine. \n9. NRTls and lactic acidosis-NRTI agents, taken alone or in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents, may cause lactic aci\u00ad\ndemia and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis. Risk factors include \nobesity, prolonged treatment with NRTis, and preexisting liver \ndysfunction . Consideration should be given to suspension ofNRTI \ntreatment in patients who devdop elevated aminotransferase levels. \nB. Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors \nNonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTls) bind \nto a site on reverse transcriptasc different from the binding site of \nNRTis. Nonnucleoside drugs do not require phosphorylation to be \nactive and do not compete with nucleoside triphosphates. There is \nno cross-resistance with NRTis. Resistance from mutations in the \npol gene occurs very rapidly if these agents are used as monotherapy. \n1. Delavirdine-Drug interactions are a major problem with \ndelavirdine, which is metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. CHAPTER 49 Antiviral Agents 419 \nIts blood levels are decreased by antacids, ddI, phenytoin, rifampin, \nand nelfinavir. Conversely, the blood levels of delavirdine arc \nincreased by azole antifungals and macrolide antibiotics. Delavir\u00ad\ndine increases plasma levels of several benzodiazepines, nifedipine, \nprotease inhibitors, quinidine, and warfarin. Delavirdine causes \nskin rash in up to 20% of patients, and the drug should be avoided \nin pregnancy because it is teratogenic in animals. \n2. Efavlrenz-Efavirenz can be given once daily because of \nits long half-life. Fatty foods may enhance its oral bioavailabil\u00ad\nity. Efavirenz is metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 and \nis frequently involved in drug interactions. Toxicity of efavirenz \nincludes CNS dysfunction, skin rash, and elevations of plasma \ncholesterol. Efavirenz is one of the NNRTI agents recommended \nfor use in pregnancy, but should be initiated after the first 8 weeks \ndue to birth defects observed in a primate study at doses similar to \nthose used in humans. \n3. Etravirine-Etravirine is a second-generation NNRTI with a \nlonger half-life and reduced toxicity compared to efavirenz and \nnevirapine. It is approved for treatment-experienced HIV patients, \nand may be effective against HIV strains resistant to other drugs in \nthe group. The drug causes rash, nausea, and diarrhea. Elevations \nin scrum cholesterol, triglycerides, and transaminase levels may \noccur. Etravirine is a substrate as wdl as an inducer of CYP3A4 \nand also inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and may be involved in \nsignificant drug-drug interactions. Doravirine is similar. \n4. Nevirapine-Nevirapine has good oral bioavailability, pen\u00ad\netrates most tissues including the CNS, has a half-life of more \nthan 24 h, and is metabolized by the hepatic CYP3A4 isoform. \nThe drug is used in combination regimens and is effective in pre\u00ad\nventing HIV vertical transmission when given as single doses to \nmothers at the onset oflabor and to the neonate. Hypersensitivity \nreactions with nevirapine include a rash, which occurs in 15-20% \nof patients, especially females. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and \na life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been \nreported. N evirapine blood levels are increased by cimetidine and \nmacrolide antibiotics and decreased by enzyme inducers such as \nrifampin. \n5. Rilpivirine-Rilpivirine, another second-generation NNRTI, \nis a highly protein-bound diarylpyrimidine with a long half-life of \n50 h. Its oral bioavailability is dependent on an acid gastric envi\u00ad\nronment for optimal absorption; thus antacids and H2-receptor \nantagonists should be separated in time and proton pump inhibi\u00ad\ntors are contraindicated. Rilpivirine is one of the NNRTI agents \nrecommended for use in pregnancy. Rilpivirine is primarily metab\u00ad\nolized by CYP3A4, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 \nmay thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. The most common \nadverse effects associated with rilpivirine therapy are rash, depres\u00ad\nsion, headache, insomnia, and increased serum aminotransferases. \nIncreased serum cholesterol and fat redistribution syndrome have \nalso been reponed. Higher doses have been associated with QT c \nprolongation."

Oral absorption of atazanavir requires \nan acidic environment-antacid ingestion should be separated by \n12 h. The drug penetrates cerebrospinal and seminal fluids and \nundergoes biliary dimination. Adverse effects include GI distress, \nperipheral neuropathy, skin rash, and hyperbilirubinemia . Pro\u00ad\nlongation of the QTc interval may occur at high doses. Unlike \nmost Pis, atazanavir does not appear to be associated with dyslip\u00ad\nidemias, fat deposition, or a metabolic syndrome. However, it is a \npotent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and UGTlAl. \n2. Darunavlr- This drug is used in combination with ritonavir \nor cobicistat in treatment-experienced patients with resistance to \nother Pis. The drug is a substrate of CYP3A4. GI adverse effects \nand rash occur, and liver toxicity has been reported. Darunavir \ncontains a sulfonamide moiety and should be used with caution in \npatients with sulfonamide allergy. \n3. Fosamprenavir-Fosamprenavir is a prodrug, forming \namprenavir via its hydrolysis in the GI tract. The drug formulation \nincludes propylene glycol and should not be used in children or \nin pregnant women. Fosamprenavir is often used in combination \nwith low-dose ritonavir. The absorption of amprenavir is impeded \nby fatty foods. Amprenavir undergoes hepatic metabolism and is \nboth an inhibitor and an inducer of CYP3A4. The drug causes GI \ndistress, paresthesias, and rash, the latter sometimes severe enough \nto warrant drug discontinuation. Cross-allergenicity may occur \nwith sulfonamides. \n4. lndinavir-Oral bioavailability of indinavir is good except in \nthe presence of food. Clearance is mainly via the liver, with about \n10% renal excretion. Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, \nthrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and nephrolithiasis. To \nreduce renal damage, it is important to maintain good hydration. \nInsulin resistance may be more common with indinavir than other \nPis. Indinavir is a substrate for and an inhibitor of the cytochrome \nP450 isoform CYP3A4 and is implicated in drug interactions. \nSerum levels of indinavir are increased by azole antifungals and \ndecreased by rifamycins . Indinavir increases the serum levds of \nantihistamines, benzodiazepines, and rifampin. 5. Lopinavir/ritonavir-In this combination, a subtherapeutic \ndose of ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (\"booster\") by \ninhibiting the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism oflopinavir. Patient \ncompliance is improved owing to lower pill burden and the com\u00ad\nbination is usually well tolerated. \n6. Nelflnavlr- This PI is characterized by increased oral absorp\u00ad\ntion in the presence of food, hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, and \na short half-life. As an inhibitor of drug metabolism, nelfinavir has \nbeen involved in many drug interactions. Adverse effects include \ndiarrhea, which can be dose-limiting. The drug has the most favor\u00ad\nable safety profile of the Pis in pregnancy. \n7. Ritonavir-Oral bioavailability is good, and the drug should \nbe taken with meals. Clearance is mainly via the liver, and dosage \nreduction is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. The \nmost common adverse effects of ritonavir are GI irritation and a \nbitter taste. Paresthesias and elevations of hepatic aminotransfer\u00ad\nases and triglycerides in the plasma also occur. Drugs that increase \nthe activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4 (anticonvul\u00ad\nsants, rifamycins) reduce serum levels of ritonavir, and drugs that \ninhibit this enzyme (azole antifungals, cimetidine, erythromycin) \nelevate serum levels of the antiviral drug. Ritonavir inhibits the \nmetabolism of a wide range of drugs, including erythromycin, \ndronabinol, ketoconazole, prednisone, rifampin, and saquinavir. \nSubtherapeutic doses of ritonavir inhibit the CYP3A-mediated \nmetabolism of other protease inhibitors (eg, indinavir, lopinavir, \nsaquinavir); this is the rationale for PI combinations that include \nritonavir as a \"booster\" because it permits the use oflower doses of \nthe other protease inhibitor. \n8. Saqulnavlr-Original formulations of saquinavir had low and \nerratic oral bioavailability. Reformulation for once-daily dosing in \ncombination with low-dose ritonavir has improved efficacy with \ndecreased GI side effects. The drug undergoes extensive first-pass \nmetabolism and functions as both a substrate and inhibitor of \nCYP3A4. Adverse effects of saquinavir include nausea, diarrhea, \ndyspepsia, and rhinitis. Saquinavir plasma levels are increased by \nazole antifungals, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, indinavir, and \nritonavir. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 decrease plasma levels of \nsaquinavir. \n9. Tipranavir- This is a newer drug used in combination with \nritonavir in treatment-experienced patients with resistance to \nother Pis. The drug is a substrate and inducer of CYP3A4 and also \ninduces P-glycoprotein transporters , possibly altering GI absorp\u00ad\ntion of other drugs. For example, increased blood levels of the \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (eg, lovastatin) may occur, thus \nincreasing the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. GI adverse \neffects, rash, and liver toxicity have been reponed. \n1 a. Effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism-The \nuse of Pis in HAART drug combinations has led to the develop\u00ad\nment of disorders in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It has \nbeen suggested that this is due to the inhibition oflipid-regulating \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The syndrome includes hyperglycemia and insu\u00ad\nlin resistance or hyperlipidemia, with altered body fat distribu\u00ad\ntion. Buflalo hump, gynecomastia, and truncal obesity may occur \nwith facial and peripheral lipodystrophy. The syndrome has been \nobserved with Pis used in HAART regimens, with an incidence of \n30-50% and a median onset time of approximately 1 year dura\u00ad\ntion of treatment. Atazanavir does not appear to be associated with \ndyslipidemia or hyperglycemia. \nD. Entry and Fusion Inhibitors \nf. Maraviroc-HN-1 infection begins with attachment of an \nHN envelope protein called gp120 to CD4 molecules on surfaces \nof helper T cells and other antigen-presenting cells such as macro\u00ad\nphages and dendritic cells. The attachment of many HN strains \ninvolves a transmembrane chemokine receptor CCR5 (ie, CCR5-\ntropic HN strains). This receptor, a human protein, is the target \nfor maraviroc, which blocks viral attachment. Although resistance \nhas occurred, there is minimal cross-resistance with other antiret\u00ad\nroviral drugs. Note that CXCR4-tropic HIV is not affected by \nmaraviroc so tropic testing of the virus is key. \nMaraviroc is used orally and has good tissue penetration. It is a \nsubstrate for CYP3A4, and dosage adjustments may be needed in \nthe presence of drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme. Adverse \neffects of maraviroc include cough, diarrhea, muscle and joint \npain, and increases in hepatic transaminases. \n2. Enfuvlnlde-Enfuvirtide is a synthetic 36-amino-acid pep\u00ad\ntide. The drug binds to the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope \nglycoprotein, preventing the conformational changes required for \nthe fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. There is no cross\u00ad\nresistance with other anti-HN drugs, but resistance may occur via \nmutations in the mv gene. Enfuvirtide is administered subcutane\u00ad\nously in combination with other anti-HN agents in previously \ndrug-treated patients with persistent HN-1 replication despite \nongoing therapy. Its metabolism via hydrolysis does not involve \nthe cytochrome P450 system. Injection site reactions and hyper\u00ad\nsensitivity may occur. An increased incidence of bacterial pneumo\u00ad\nnia has been reported. \n3. /ba/izumab-lbalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds \nthe CD4 receptor and blocks HN entry into CD4 cells. It is indi\u00ad\ncated for patients with multidrug-resistant HN who have failed an \noral antiretroviral regimen. It must be administered intravenously \nand is combined with additional active agents. \nE. lntegrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors \nRaltcgravir is a pyrimidine derivative that binds integrase, an \nenzyme essential to replication of both HN-1 and HN-2, inhib\u00ad\niting strand transfer. As a result, integration of reverse-transcribed \nHN DNA into host cell chromosomes is inhibited. The drug \nhas been used mainly in treatment-naive HIV patients, usually in \ncombination regimens. The drug is metabolized by glucuronida\u00ad\ntion and is not affected by agents that induce or inhibit hepatic CHAPTER 49 Antiviral Agents 421 \ncytochromes P450. However, if used with rifampin, which induces \nUDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the dose of raltegravir should be \ndoubled. Adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. An \nincrease in creatine kinase has been reported, with potential for \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Dolutcgravir and bic:tcgravir are \nless subject to resistance development and are often part of fust\u00ad\nline regimens. They are formulated with tenofovir alafenamide \nand emtricitabine, and administered once daily. They should be \navoided in pregnancy. Elvitegravir is similar. \nANTI-INFLUENZA AGENTS \nA. Oseltamivir and Zanamivir \nJ. Mechanisms-These drugs arc inhibitors of ncuraminidascs \nproduced by influenza A and B and are currently active against \nboth H3N2 and HlNl strains. These viral enzymes cleave sialic \nacid residues from viral proteins and surface proteins of infected \ncells. They function to promote virion release and to prevent \nclumping of newly released virions. By interfering with these \nactions, neuraminidase inhibitors impede viral spread. Decreased \nsusceptibility to the drugs is associated with mutations in viral \nneuraminidase, but worldwide, resistance remains rare. \n2. Clinical use and toxicily-Oseltamivir is a prodrug used \norally, and activated in the gut and the liver. Zanamivir is admin\u00ad\nistered intranasally. Both drugs decrease the duration of influenza \nsymptoms and are more effective if used within 24 h after onset \nof symptoms. Taken prophylactically, oseltamivir significantly \ndecreases the incidence of influenza. GI symptoms may occur with \noseltamivir; zanamivir may cause cough and throat discomfort and \nhas induced bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. \nB. Baloxavfr \nBaloxavir marboxil is a new prodrug that is converted to baloxavir, \nwhich interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks influ\u00ad\nenza A and influenza B virus replication. It acts early in the viral \nreplication cycle and has a long half-life of 80 hours. Resistance to \nbaloxavir is very low at present. \nC. Amantadine and Rimantadine \nJ. Mechanisms-Amantadine and rimantadine inhibit an early \nstep in replication of the influenza A (hut not influenza B) virus \n(Figure 49-1). They prevent uncoating by binding to a proton \nchannel that is required at the onset of infection to acidify the \nvirus core. Acidification of the core activates viral RNA transcrip\u00ad\ntase. Adamantane-resistant influenza A virus mutants are now \ncommon. \n2. Qinical uses and toxicity-These drugs are prophylactic against \ninfluenza A virus infection and can reduce the duration of symptoms \nif given within 48 h after contact. However, adamantane-resistant \ninfluenza A virus mutants including H3N2 strains causing sea\u00ad\nsonal influenza in the United States have increased dramatically. \nThe HlNl strain responsible for the 2009 pandemic that contains"

Fortunately, there is minimal cross\u00ad\nresistancc to the neuraminidase inhibitors. Toxic effects of these \nagents include GI irritation, dizziness, ataxia, and slurred speech. \nRimantadine' s activity is no greater than that of amantadine, but \nit has a longer half-life and requires no dosage adjustment in renal \nfailure. \nResistance to the adamantanes is very high and usage of these \nagents has declined. \nAGENTS USED IN VIRAL HEPATITIS \nThe agents available for use in the treatment of infections caused \nby HBV are suppressive rather than curative. The primary goal of \ndrugs used for infections caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is viral \neradication. The drugs available include pegylated interferon CX.-2a, \ninterferon cx.-2b, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivu\u00ad\ndine, tenofovir, ribavirin, and sofosbuvir. \nA.IFN-a \nf. Mechanisms-IFN-a is a cytokine that acts through host cell \nsurface receptors increasing the activity of Janus kinases OAKs). \nThese enzymes phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of \ntranscriptions (STATs) to increase the formation of antiviral pro\u00ad\nteins. The selective antiviral action of IFN-a is primarily due to \nactivation of a host cdl ribonuclease that preferentially degrades \nviral mRNA IFN-cx also promotes formation of natural killer cells \nthat destroy infected liver cells. \n2. Phannacolcinetics-There are several forms of IFN-a with \nminor differences in amino acid composition. Absorption from \nintramuscular or subcutaneous injection is slow; elimination of \nIFN-a is mainly via proteolytic hydrolysis in the kidney. Conven\u00ad\ntional forms of IFN-cx are usually administered daily or 3 times a \nweek. Pegylated forms ofIFN-a conjugated to polyethylene glycol \ncan be administered once a week. \n3. Clinical uses-Interferon-a is used in chronic HBV as an \nindividual agent or in combination with other drugs. When used \nin combination with ribavirin, the progression of acute HCV \ninfection to chronic HCV is reduced. Pegylated IFN-a together \nwith ribavirin is superior to standard forms ofIFN-a in chronic \nHCV. Other uses ofIFN-a include treatment of Kaposi sarcoma, \npapillomatosis , and topically for genital warts. \n4. Toxicity-Toxic effects ofIFN-a include GI irritation, a flu\u00ad\nlike syndrome, neutropenia, profound fatigue and myalgia, alope\u00ad\ncia, reversible hearing loss, thyroid dysfunction, mental confusion, \nand severe depression. Contraindications include pregnancy. \nB. Adefovir Dipivoxil \n7. Mechanisms-Adefovir dipivoxil is the prodrug of adefovir, \nwhich competitively inhibits HBV DNA polymerase and results in \nchain termination after incorporation into the viral DNA. 2. Pharmacokinetics and clinical use-Adefovir has good oral \nbioavailability unaffected by foods. Dose reductions are required \nin renal dysfunction. \nAdefovir suppresses HBV replication and improves liver his\u00ad\ntology and fibrosis. However, serum HBV DNA reappears after \ncessation of therapy. Adefovir has activity against lamivudine\u00ad\nresistant strains ofHBV. \n3. Toxicity-Nephrotoxicity is dose-limiting. Lactic acidosis and \nsevere hepatomegaly with steatosis may also occur. \nC. Entecavlr \nEntecavir inhibits HBV DNA polymerase. Effective orally, the \ndrug undergoes renal elimination in part via active tubular secre\u00ad\ntion. Clinical efficacy is similar to that of lamivudine and there is \ncross-resistance between the two drugs. The drug causes headache, \ndizziness, fatigue, and nausea. \nD. Lamivudine \nThis nucleoside inhibitor of HN reverse transcriptase (see prior \ndiscussion) is active in chronic HBV infection. Lamivudine has a \nlonger intracellular half-life in HBV-infected cdls than in HN\u00ad\ninfected cells and thus can be used in lower doses for hepatitis \nthan for HIV infection. Used as monotherapy, lamivudine rapidly \nsuppresses HBV replication and is remarkably nontoxic. \nE. Ribavirin \n1. Mechanisms-Ribavirin inhibits the replication of a wide \nrange of DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A and B, \nparainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), paramyxoviruses, \nHCV, and HN. Although the precise antiviral mechanism of \nribavirin is not known, the drug inhibits guanosine triphosphate \nformation, prevents capping of viral mRNA, and can block RNA\u00ad\ndependent RNA polymerases. \n2. Pharmacokinetics and clinical uses-Ribavirin is effec\u00ad\ntive orally (avoid antacids) and is also available in intravenous and \naerosol forms. It is eliminated by the kidney, necessitating dose \nreductions in renal dysfunction. Ribavirin is used adjunctivdy \nwith IFN-a in chronic HCV infection in patients with com\u00ad\npensated liver disease. Monotherapy with ribavirin alone is not \neffective. Early intravenous administration of ribavirin decreases \nmortality in viral hemorrhagic fevers. Despite its alleged activity \nagainst RSV, ribavirin has been shown to have no benefit in treat\u00ad\nment of RSV infections, although it is still recommended by some \nauthorities in immunocompromised children. \n3. Toxicity-Systemic use results in dose-dependent hemolytic \nanemia. Aerosol ribavirin may cause conjunctiva! and bronchial \nirritation. Ribavirin is a known human teratogen and is absolutely \ncontraindicated in pregnancy. \nF. Newer Drugs for HBV \nTelbivudine, a nucleoside analog, is phosphorylated by cellu\u00ad\nlar kinases to the triphosphate form, which inhibits HBV DNA \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "polymerase. The drug is at least as effective as lamivudine in \nchronic HBV infections and is similar in terms of its safety pro\u00ad\nfile. Tenofovir, an antiretroviral drug, is also approved for chronic \nHBV infection and is active against lamivudine- and entecavir\u00ad\nresistant strains. Sofoabuvir inhibits RNA polymerase in HCV, \nalone or in combination with interferon or ribavirin and achieves \nvery high cure rates (90-95%). Boceprevir is a protease inhibitor \nin HCV and is used in combination with ribavirin. \nG. Treatment of Hepatitis C Infection \nThere are four current classes of direct-acting antiviral agents \n(DAAs}: nonstructural protein (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitors, \nNS5B nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, NS5B nonnucleoside \npolymerase inhibitors, and NSSA inhibitors. The main targets \nof the DAAs are the HCV-encoded proteins that are vital to the \nreplication of the virus (Figure 49-1). The safety profiles of all \nthe combination regimens are generally excellent, with adverse \nevents of mild severity and very low rates of discontinuation due \nto adverse events in clinical trials in the absence of concurrent riba\u00ad\nvirin use. \n1.NS5Alnhibitors-The NSSA protein plays a role in both viral \nreplication and the assembly of HCV; however, the exact mecha\u00ad\nnism of action of the HCV NS5A inhibitors remains unclear. \nDaclatasvir is used in combination with sofosbuvir for treat\u00ad\nment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3. It may be taken with or \nwithout food and does not require adjustment for renal or hepatic \nimpairment. Daclatasvir is generally well tolerated. The most com\u00ad\nmon adverse effects in patients receiving daclatasvir/sofosbuvir \nwere headache and fatigue, usually mild or moderate in severity. \nDaclatasvir is primarily metabolized through CYP3A metabo\u00ad\nlism and should not be given with inducers or inhibitors of this \nenzyme. Elbuvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, pibrentasvir, and vel\u00ad\npatasvir are similar. \n2. NS58 RNA Polymerase lnhlbltors-NS5B is an RNA\u00ad\ndependent RNA polymerase involved in post-translational pro\u00ad\ncessing that is necessary for replication of HCV. \nNucleoside/nucleotide analogs (eg, 1ofo1buvir) target the cata\u00ad\nlytic site ofNS5B, and are activated within the hepatocyte through \nphosphorylation to nucleoside triphosphate, which competes with \nnucleotides, resulting in chain termination. Nonnucleoside ana\u00ad\nlogs (eg, dasabuvir) act as allosteric inhibitors of NS5B. \n3. NS3/4A Protease lnhibitors-NS314A protease inhibitors \nare inhibitors of the NS3/4A serine protease, an enzyme involved \nin post-translational processing and replication ofHCV. \nGrazoprevir is a potent, pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, \nreversibly binding to HCV NS3/4A protease. It is distinct from \nearlier-generation protease inhibitors due to its pan-genotypic \nactivity, as well as activity against some of the major resistance\u00ad\nassociated variants (R155K and Dl68Y) resulting in failure with \nfirst-generation protease inhibitors. It is only available in combina\u00ad\ntion with elbasvir for treatment ofHCV genotypes 1 and 4. It is \npartially eliminated by oxidative metabolism, primarily by CYP3A CHAPTER 49 Antiviral Agents 423 \nand is mostly eliminated in the feces. Elbasvir/grazoprevir should \nnot be administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment, or in conjunction with organic anion transporting \npolypeptide lBl/3 {OATPlBl/3) inhibitors, strong inducers or \ninhibitors of CYP3A, or efavirenz. The most commonly reported \nside effects during therapy with elbasvir/gtazoprevir were fatigue, \nheadache, and nausea. Elevations in serum aminotransferases may \noccur. Paritaprevir, simeprevir, and voxilaprevir are similar. \nCORONAVIRUS DISEASE \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease \nwas first identified in December 2019, and has since spread world\u00ad\nwide to cause an ongoing 2019-2021 global pandemic. After an \naccelerated development phase, two mRNA-based vaccines were \nfound to be safe and effective and were approved by the FDA under \nan Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020. Widespread \nuse began early in 2021. Remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibi\u00ad\ntor originally developed for use against the Ebola virus, is approved \nfor intravenous use in the United States in hospitalized patients \ninfected with COVID-19. Other antiviral drugs are under study. \nQUESTIONS \nI. Which statement about the mechanisms of action of antiviral \ndrugs is accurate? \n(A) Acyclovir has no requirement for activation by \nphosphorylation \n(B) Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerase but does not \ncause chain termination \n(C) Interferon-a causes increased activity of host cell ribo\u00ad\nnucleases that degtade viral mRNA \n(D) Foscarnet is phosphorylated by thymidine kinase as the \ninitial step in HSY-infected cells \n(E) Fosamprenavir inhibits the reverse transcriptase of HIV \nwith 30-50 times more potency than host cell DNA \npolymerases \nQuestions 2 and 3. A 30-year-old male patient who is HN\u00ad\npositive and symptomatic has a CD4 count of 250/\u00b5L and a viral \nRNA load of 15,000 copies/ml. His treatment involves a 3-drug \nantiviral regimen consisting of zidovudine, didanosine, and rito\u00ad\nnavir. The patient is taking acyclovir for a herpes infection and \nketoconazole for oral candidiasis. He now complains of anorexia, \nnausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain. His abdomen is tender \nin the epigastric area. Laboratory results reveal an devated amylase \nactivity of 220 U/L, and a preliminary diagnosis is made of acute \npancreatitis. \n2.

Because didanosine must \nbe discontinued, lamivudine would be a good NRTI replace\u00ad\nment. Use of a second protease inhibitor (cg, atazanavir) with \na single reverse transcriptase inhibitor could be as effective \nas regimens that include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors, \nalthough there may be an increased possibility of drug inter\u00ad\nactions. Ata7.anavir use is associated with electrocardiographic \nPR-interval prolongation, which may be exacerbated by other \ncausative agents such as the calcium channel blocker vera\u00ad\npamil which an older patient might be taking for angina.

Although full doses of zidovudine for \n4 weeks have been shown to have prophylactic value, in high\u00ad\nrisk situations combination regimens are favored. Optimal \nprophylaxis in this case might best be provided by the com\u00ad\nbination of zidovudine with lamivudine (basic regimen), plus \nthe addition of protease inhibitors (expanded regimen). The \nanswer is E. \nS. Ganciclovir (not listed) has been the most commonly used \ndrug for prevention and treatment of CMV infections in the \nimmunocompromised patient. However, cidofovir is also \nvery effective in CMV retinitis and has good activity against \nmany strains of HSY, including those resistant to acyclovir. \nThe answer is B. \n6. Drug interactions can be severe in the immunocompromised \npatient because many of the drugs administered can influence \nthe pharmacokinetic properties of other drugs. Rifabutin, \nlike rifampin, acts as an inducer of several isoforms of hepatic \ncytochrome P450. This action can result in an increased clear\u00ad\nance of other drugs, including indinavir. The answer is D. \n7. Three of the drugs listed (foscarnet, trifluridine, valacyclovir) \nare active against strains of herpes simplex virus. Foscarnet is \nnot used in genital infections (HSV-2) because clinical effi\u00ad\ncacy has not been established, it has poor oral bioavailability, \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: \nD Identify the main targets for antiviral action in viral replication.

Trifluridine is used \ntopically but only for herpes keratoconjunctivitis {HSV-1). \nValacyclovir is converted to acyclovir by first-pass metabolism \nin the intestine and liver. The answer is E. \n8. Three of the drugs listed should be avoided, or used with \nextreme caution, in the pregnant patient. Oral forms of \namprenavir and emtricitabine both contain propylene gly\u00ad\ncol, a potentially toxic compound. Efavirenz has caused fetal \nabnormalities in pregnant monkeys and should be avoided \nduring the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. However, one of the \ndistinctive adverse effects of emtricitabine is hyperpigmenta\u00ad\ntion. The answer is B. \n9. Lamivudine is used in monotherapy of HBV infections and \ndoes not oppose the beneficial effects of interferon-a when \nboth agents are used together in the treatment of hepatitis B. \nThe answer is D. \n10. Acyclovir is eliminated in the urine by glomerular filtration \nand by active tubular secretion, which is inhibited by proben\u00ad\necid. Nephrotoxic effects, including hematuria and crystallu\u00ad\nria, are enhanced in patients who are dehydrated or who have \npreexisting renal dysfunction.

It is no longer the drug of choice for treatment of \npseudomembranous colitis resulting from C difficile but may be \nused in conjunction with vancomycin for this condition. It is \neffective in anaerobic or mixed intra-abdominal infections and \nin brain abscess. Tinidawle has similar activity versus anaero\u00ad\nbic bacteria. Metronidazole is also used for infections involving \nGardntrella vagina/is and in regimens for the eradication of \nHelicobacttr pylori in gastric ulcers. As antiprotozoal drugs, met\u00ad\nronidawle and tinidazole are effective drugs in trichomoniasis, \ngiardiasis, and the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic \nhepatic abscess (see Chapter 52). \n4.

Fidaxomicin has been FDA-approved for the treatment \nof C difficile infection in adults. \n3. Toxicity-Negligible due to limited absorption. \nC. Rifaximin \n1. Mechanisms-Rifaximin is a derivative of rifampin. It is \nactive against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaer\u00ad\nobes. Rifaximin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. \n2. Pharmacoldnetics and clinical use-When administered \norally, systemic absorption is <0.5%, but fecal concentrations are high; it is now used in the management of hepatic encephalopa\u00ad\nthy, irritable bowd syndrome with diarrhea, and, occasionally, as \nan adjunct in cases of refractory C difficile infection in adults. \n3. Tax/city-Negligible due to limited absorption. \nD. Mupirocin \nJ. Mechanisms-Mupirocin is a natural product from \nPseudomonas Jl.u.orescnu. It acts on gram-positive cocci and inhib\u00ad\nits protein synthesis by selectively binding to isoleucyl-tRNA \nsynthetase. \n2. Pharmacoldnetlcs and cllnlcal use-Mupirocin is used \ntopically and is not absorbed. This drug is indicated for impetigo \ncaused by staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), \n!}-hemolytic streptococci , and Streptococcus pyogenes.

Nitrofurantoin \nThis drug is active against many urinary tract pathogens (but not \nProteus or Pseudomonas), and resistance emerges slowly. Single \ndaily doses of the drug can prevent recurrent urinary tract infec\u00ad\ntions, and acidification of the urine enhances its activity. The drug \nis active orally and is excreted in the urine via filtration and secre\u00ad\ntion; toxic levels may occur in the blood of patients with renal \ndysfunction. Adverse effects of nitrofurantoin include gastrointes\u00ad\ntinal irritation, skin rashes, pulmonary infiltrates, phototoxicity, \nneuropathies, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate \ndehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. \nB. Nalidixic Acid \nThis quinolone drug acts against many gram-negative organ\u00ad\nisms (but not Proteus or Pseudomonas) by mechanisms that may \ninvolve urine acidification or inhibition of DNA gytase. Resis\u00ad\ntance emerges rapidly. The drug is active orally and is excreted in \nthe urine partly unchanged and partly as the inactive glucuronide. \nToxic effects include gastrointestinal irritation, glycosuria, skin \nrashes, phototoxicity, visual disturbances, and CNS stimulation. \nNitrofurantoin may antagonize the action of nalidixic acid. \nC. Methenamine \nMethenamine manddate and methenamine hippurate combine \nurine acidification with the rdease of the antibacterial compound \nformaldehyde at pH levels lower than 5.5. These drugs are not \nusually active against Proteus because these organisms alkalinize \nthe urine. Insoluble complexes form between formaldehyde and \nsulfonamides, and the drugs should not be used together. \nDISINFECTANTS, ANTISEPTICS, Br \nSTERILANTS \nAlthough the terms are often used interchangeably, a disinfectant \nis a compound that is used to kill microorganisms in an inanimate \nenvironment, whereas an antiseptic is one that is used to inhibit \nbacterial growth both in vitro and in contact with the surfaces of \nliving tissues. Disinfectants and antiseptics do not have selective \ntoxicity. Most antiseptics delay wound healing. Sterilants kill both \nvegetative cells and spores when applied to materials for appropri\u00ad\nate times and temperatures. Hand hygiene is probably the most \nimportant means of preventing transmission of infectious agents \nfrom person to person or from regions of high microbial load, \nfor example, mouth, nose, or gut, to potential sites of infection. \nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers and soap and warm water are used \nto remove bacteria. \nA. Alcohols, Aldehydes, and Acids \nEthanol (70%) and ilopropanol (70-90%) are effective skin anti\u00ad\nseptics because they denature microbial proteins. Formaldehyde, \nwhich also denatures proteins, is too irritating for topical use but is a disinfectant for instruments. Acetic acid (1 %} is used in sur\u00ad\ngical dressings and has activity against gram-negative bacteria, \nincluding Pseudomonas, when used as a urinary irrigant and in the \nexternal ear. Salicylic acid and undecylenic acid are useful in the \ntreatment of dermatophyte infections. \nB. Halogens \nIodine tincture is an effective antiseptic for intact skin and, \nalthough it can cause dermatitis, is commonly used in preparing \nthe skin before taking blood samples. Iodine complexed with povi\u00ad\ndone (povidone-iodine) is widely used, particularly as a preopera\u00ad\ntive skin antiseptic, but solutions can become contaminated with \naerobic gram-negative bacteria. \nHypochlorous acid, formed when chlorine dissolves in water, \nis antimicrobial. This is the basis for the use of chlorine and hala\u00ad\nzone in water purification. Organic matter binds chlorine, thus \npreventing antimicrobial actions. In a given water sample, this \nprocess is referred to as the chlorine demand because the chlorine\u00ad\nbinding capacity of the organic material must be exceeded before \nbacterial killing is accomplished. Many preparations of chlorine \nfor water purification do not eradicate all bacteria or entamoeba \ncysts. \nSodium hypochlorite is the active component in household \nbleach, a 1: 10 dilution of which is recommended by the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the disinfection \nof blood spills that may contain HN or hepatitis B virus (HBV). \nC. Oxidizing Agents \nHydrogen peroxide exerts a short-lived antimicrobial action \nthrough the release of molecular oxygen. The agent is used as a \nmouthwash, for cleansing wounds, and for disinfection of contact \nlenses. Potassium permanganate is an effective bactericidal agent \nbut has the disadvantage of causing persistent brown stains on skin \nand clothing. \nD. Heavy Metals \nMercury and silver precipitate proteins and inactivate sulfhydryl \ngroups of enzymes but are used rarely because of toxicity. Organic \nmercurials such as nitromersol and thimerosal frequently cause \nhypersensitivity reactions but continue to be used as preservatives \nfor vaccines, antitoxins, and immune sera. Merbromin is a weak \nantiseptic and stains tissues a bright red color. In the past silver \nnitrate was commonly used for prevention of neonatal gonococcal \nophthalmia, but it has been largely replaced by topical antibiotics. \nSilver sulfadiu:ine (a sulfonamide} is used to decrease bacterial \ncolonization in burns. \nE. Chlorinated Phenols \nOwing to its toxicity, phenol itself is used only as a disinfectant \nof inanimate objects. Mixtures of phenolic derivatives are used in \nantiseptics but can cause skin irritation. Haaddorophene has \nbeen widely used in surgical scrub routines and in deodorant soaps, \nwhere it forms antibacterial deposits on the skin, decreasing the \npopulation of resident bacteria. Repeated use on the skin in infants \ncan lead to absorption of the drug, resulting in CNS white matter \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Crota.mi\u00ad\nton is a scabicide with some antipruritic effects, which can be used \nas an alternative to lindane. Allergic contact hypersensitivity may \noccur. Permetbrin is used topically in pediculosis and scabies; \nadverse effects include transient burning, stinging, and pruritus. \nThe organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor malathion is also \nused topically in pediculosis. \nG. Cationic Surfactants \nBemalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride are used \nas disinfectants of surgical instruments and surfaces such as floors \nand bench tops. Because they are effective against most bacteria \nand fungi and are not irritating, they are also used as antiseptics. \nHowever, when used on the skin, the antimicrobial action of these \nagents is antagonized by soaps and multivalent cations. The CDC \nhas recommended that benzalkonium chloride and similar quater\u00ad\nnary compounds not be used as antiseptics because outbreaks of \ninfection have resulted from growth of gram-negative bacteria (eg, \nPsewlomonas) in such antiseptic solutions. \nH. Ultraviolet Irradiation \nUltraviolet irradiation is used in some health care facilities as an \nalternate mode of disinfection for patient care areas. It has rapid \nbactericidal activity against numerous pathogens, providing effec\u00ad\ntive decontamination for most bacteria in less than 25 min and \nagainst C difficile in less than one hour. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

A young woman is brought to a hospital \nemergency department with intense abdominal pain of 2 days \nduration . The pain has spread to the right lower quadrant and is \naccompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever. She arrives at the emergency department with a blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg, \npulse 120/min, and temperature 40\u00b0C. Her abdomen has a board\u00ad\nlike rigidity with diffuse pain to palpation. Laboratory values \ninclude the following: WBC 20,000/\u00b5L and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. \nAfter abdominal x-ray films are taken, a preliminary diagnosis of \nabdominal sepsis is made, possibly resulting from bowel perfo\u00ad\nration. After appropriate samples are sent to the laboratory for \nculture, the patient is hospitalized, and antimicrobial therapy is \nstarted with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. \n2. Regarding the treatment of this patient, which statement is \naccurate? \n(A) A drug active against anaerobes should be included in \nthe antimicrobial drug regimen \n(B) Cultures are pointless because this is probably a mixed \ninfection \n(C) Empiric antibiotic therapy of abdominal sepsis should \nalways include a third-generation cephalosporin \n(D) Gram stain of the blood would provide positive identifi\u00ad\ncation of the specific organism involved in this infection \n(E) The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin provides \ngood coverage for all likely pathogens \n3. If the antibiotic regimen in this patient is modified to include \nmetronidaz.ole \n(A) Ampicillin should be excluded from the regimen \n(B) Coverage will be extended to methicillin-resistant \nstaphylococci \n(C) Gentamicin should be excluded from the regimen \n(D) Metronidazole should not be administered intravenously \n(E) The patient should be monitored for candidiasis \n4. Which compound is the safest drug to use topically to treat \nscabies and pediculosis? \n(A) Benzoyl peroxide \n(B) Chlorhexidine \n(C) Lindane \n(D) Permethrin \n(E) Silver sulfadiazine \n5.

In \naddition, some gram-negative bacilli are able to grow in solu\u00ad\ntions containing benzalkonium salts. Bacterial growth may \nalso occur in solutions of povidone-iodine. The answer is B. \n2. Abdominal sepsis is commonly a mixed infection; the most \nlikely pathogens are Bacteroides ftagilis, Enterobacteriaceae, \nand Enterococcus faecalis. An antibiotic regimen that includes \nCHECKLIST \nWhen you complete this chapter, you should be able to: only ampicillin and gentamicin does not control B fragilis. \nEmpiric treaunent in this case should include a drug active \nagainst this pathogen (eg, metronidazole, cefoxitin, cefotetan, \nor dindamycin). The answer is A. \n3. Fungal superinfections, especially from Candida albicans, \noccur frequently during treatment with metronidazole. In \nmost cases of abdominal sepsis, metronidazole would be given \nby slow intravenous infusion. Both ampicillin and gentami\u00ad\ncin should be maintained until the infection is controlled, at \nwhich time surgery is indicated. Metronidazole has no activity \nagainst aerobes. The combination of ampicillin, gentamicin, \nand metronidazole does not provide coverage for methicillin\u00ad\nresistant staphylococci. The answer is E. \n4. Of the agents listed, both lindane and permethrin are effec\u00ad\ntive scabicides and pediculicides. However, there is some con\u00ad\ncern about systemic absorption of lindane, which may cause \nneurotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Accidental ingestion oflin\u00ad\ndane in children has caused seizures. The answer is D. \n5. Below pH 5.5, methenamine releases formaldehyde, which is \nantibacterial. This pH is achieved in the urine but nowhere \nelse in the body. Ascorbic acid is sometimes given with methe\u00ad\nnamine salts to ensure a low urinary pH. The answer is A. \n6.

There is no cross-resistance between the \ndrug and other drugs used in the treatment of bacterial infec\u00ad\ntions of the urinary tract. The answer is D. \n7. No antiseptic in current use is able to promote wound heal\u00ad\ning, and most agents do the opposite. In general, cleansing \nof abrasions and superficial wounds with soap and water is \njust as effective as and less damaging than the application of \ntopical antiseptics.

            "Text": "C H A P T E R \nClinical Use of \nAntiinicrobial Agents \nA. Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy \nEmpiric (or presumptive) antimicrobial therapy is begun before \na specific pathogen has been identified and is based on the pre\u00ad\nsumption of an infection that requires immediate drug treatment. \nBefore initiation of such therapy, accepted practice involves mak\u00ad\ning a clinical diagnosis of microbial infection, obtaining specimens \nfor laboratory analyses, making a microbiologic diagnosis, decid\u00ad\ning whether treatment should precede the results of laboratory \ntests, and, finally, selecting the optimal drug or drugs. A variety of \npublications and the internet provide updated lists of antimicro\u00ad\nbial drugs of choice for specific pathogens. Such lists can provide \na useful guide to empiric therapy based on presumptive microbio\u00ad\nlogic diagnosis. Tables 51-1 and 51-2 show examples of empiric \nantimicrobial therapy based on microbiologic etiology. \nB. Prlnclples of Antlmlcroblal Therapy \nAntimicrobial therapy in established infections is guided by several \nprinciples. \n7. Susceptibility testing- The results of susceptibility testing \nestablish the drug sensitivity of the organism. These results usu\u00ad\nally predict the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) \nor minimum bacte1'icidal concentrations (MBCs) of a drug \nfor comparison with anticipated blood or tissue levels. The two \nmost common methods of susceptibility testing are disk diffusion \n(Kirby-Bauer) and broth dilution. For severe infections caused by \ncertain bacteria (eg, gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus injlue1124e), \na direct test for beta-lactamase is used to aid in the selection of an \nappropriate antibiotic. \n2. Drug concentration in blood-The measurement of drug \nconcentration in the blood may be appropriate when using agents \nwith a low therapeutic index (eg, aminoglycosides, vancomycin) \nand when investigating poor clinical response to a drug treatment \nregimen. \n3. Serum bactericidal titers-In certain infections in which \nhost defenses may contribute minimally to cure, the estimation of \nserum bactericidal titers can confirm the appropriateness of choice \nof drug and dosage. Serial dilutions of serum are incubated with \n434 standardized quantities of the pathogen isolated from the patient; \nkilling at a dilution of 1:8 is generally considered satisfactory. \n4. Route of administration-Parenteral therapy is preferred \nin most cases of serious microbial infections. Chloramphenicol, \nthe fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u00ad\nSMZ) may be effective orally. \n5.Monitoringof therapeuticresponse-Therapeutic responses \nto drug therapy should be monitored clinically and microbiologi\u00ad\ncally to detect the development of resistance or superinfections. \nThe duration of drug therapy required depends on the pathogen \n(eg, longer courses of therapy are required for infections caused \nby fungi or mycobacteria), the site of infection (eg, endocarditis \nand osteomyelitis require longer duration of treatment), and the \nimmunocompetence of the patient. \n6. Clinical failure of antimicrobial therapy-Inadequate \nclinical or microbiologic response to antimicrobial therapy can \nresult from laboratory testing errors, problems with the drug (eg, \nincorrect choice, poor tissue penetration, inadequate dose), the \npatient (poor host defenses, undrained abscesses), or the pathogen \n(resistance, superinfection). \nC. Fadors Influencing Antimicrobial Drug Use \n1. Bactericidal versus bacteriostatic actions-Antibiotics \nclassified as bacteriostatic include clindamycin, macrolides, sul\u00ad\nfonamides, and tetracyclines. For bacteriostatic drugs, the concen\u00ad\ntrations that inhibit growth are much lower than those that kill \nbacteria. Antibiotics classified as bactericidal include the amino\u00ad\nglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole , most \nantimycobacterial agents, streptogramins, and vancomycin. For \nsuch drugs, there is little difference between the concentrations \nthat inhibit growth and those that kill bacteria. Bactericidal drugs \nare preferred for the treatment of endocarditis and meningitis and \nfor most infections in patients with impaired defense mechanisms, \nespecially immunocompromised patients. \nSome bactericidal agents (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) \ncause concentration-dependent killing. Maximizing peak blood \nlevels of such drugs increases the rate and the extent of their \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Erythromycin inhibits the hepatic metabolism \nof a number of drugs, including clozapine, lidocainc, loratadinc, \nphenytoin, quinidine, sildenafil, theophylline, and warfarin. Keto\u00ad\nconazole inhibits the metabolism of caffeine, carbamazepine, \ncyclosporine, statins, methadone, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, \nsildenafil, verapamil, and zidovudine.

Antlmlcroblal Drug Combinations \nMost infections should be treated with a single agent. However, \ntherapy with multiple antimicrobials may be indicated in several \nclinical situations as follows. \n1.Emergencysituatians-ln severe infections (eg, sepsis, men\u00ad\ningitis), combinations of antimicrobial drugs arc used empirically \nto suppress all of the most likely pathogens. \n2. To delay resistance-The combined use of drugs is valid \nwhen the rapid emergence of resistance impairs the chances for \ncure. For this reason, combined drug therapy is especially impor\u00ad\ntant in the treatment of tuberculosis. \n3. Mixed infections-Multiple organisms may be involved in \nsome infections. For example, peritoneal infections may be caused \nby several pathogens (eg, anaerobes and coliforms); a combination \nof drugs may be required to achieve coverage. Skin infections are \noften due to mixed bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens. \n4. To achieve synergistic effects-The use of a drug combi\u00ad\nnation against a specific pathogen may result in an effect greater \nthan that achieved with a single drug. Examples include the use \nof penicillins with gentamicin in enterococcal endocarditis, the \nuse of an extended-spectrum penicillin plus an aminoglycosidc \nin Psnukimonas aeruginosa infections, and the combined use of \namphotericin B and flucytosine in cryptococcal meningitis. Anti\u00ad\nbiotic combinations arc also commonly used in the management \nof infections resulting from S epit/mnidis and penicillin-resistant \npneumococci (eg, vancomycin plus rifampin). Several mecha\u00ad\nnisms, discussed next, may account for synergism. \na. Sequential blockade-The combined use of drugs may \ncause inhibition of two or more steps in a metabolic pathway. For \nexample, TMP-SMZ block different steps in the formation of tet\u00ad\nrahydrofolic acid. \nb. Blockade of drug-Inactivating enzymes-Clavulanic \nacid, sulbactam, and tazobactam inhibit penicillinascs and are \noften used with penicillinase-sensitive beta-lactam drugs. \nc. Enhanced drug uptake-Increased permeability to amino\u00ad\nglycosides after exposure of certain bacteria to cell wall-inhibiting CHAPTER 51 Clinical Use of Antimicrobial Agents 437 \nantimicrobials (cg, beta-lactams) is thought to underlie some syn\u00ad\nergistic effects. \nE. Antimicrobial Chemoprophylaxis \nThe general principles of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis can be \nsummarized as follows: (1) Prophylaxis should always be directed \ntoward a specific pathogen; (2) no resistance should develop \nduring the period of drug use; (3) prophylactic drug use should be \nof limited duration; (4) conventional therapeutic doses should \nbe used; and (5) prophylaxis should be used only in situations of \ndocumented drug d'ficacy. \nNonsurgical prophylaxis includes the prevention of cytomcga\u00ad\nlovirus (CMV), herpesvirus (HSY) infections, HN infections in \nhealth care workers, influenza, malaria, mcningococcal infections, \nand tuberculosis. In patients with AIDS, prophylactic measures \nare directed toward prevention of Pneumocystis jirov\u00abii pneumo\u00ad\nnia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis. Though somewhat less effective, \nantimicrobial prophylaxis is also commonly used for animal or \nhuman bite wounds and chronic bronchitis. Severely leukopenic \npatients are often given prophylactic antibiotics. \nProphylaxis against postsurgical infections should be limited \nto procedures that are associated with infection in more than 5% \nof untreated cases under optimal conditions. Prophylaxis should \nembody the principles listed previously, with drug selection based \non the most likely infecting organism and treatment initiated just \nbefore surgery and continued throughout the procedure. A flrst\u00ad\ngeneration cephalosporin (cg, cefazolin) is often the prophylactic \ndrug of choice. \nThe selection of vancomycin over cefazolin may be necessary \nin hospitals with high rates of methicillin-resistant S aureus or \nS tpidermidis infections. Cefoxitin or cefotetan may be used for \nsurgical patients at risk for infection caused by anaerobic bac\u00ad\nteria. Situations in which surgical prophylaxis is of benefit (or \ncommonly used) include gastrointestinal procedures, vaginal \nhysterectomy, cesarean section delivery, joint replacement, open \nfracture surgery, and dental procedures in patients with valvular \ndisease or prostheses. \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1-3. A hospitalized AIDS patient is receiving antiret\u00ad\nroviral drugs but no antimicrobial prophylaxis. He develops sepsis \nwith fever, suspected to be caused by a gram-negative bacillus. \n1. Antimicrobial treatment of this severely immune-depressed \npatient should not be initiated before \n(A) Antipyretic drugs have been given to reduce body \ntemperature \n(B) Infecting organism(s) have been identified by the micro-\nbiology laboratory \n(C) Results of a Gram stain arc available \n(D) Results of antibacterial susceptibility tests are available \n(E) Specimens have been taken for laboratory tests and \nexamination"

Four species of Plasmodium commonly infect \nhumans (P fa/ciparum, P malariae, P ovak, P vivax) and undergo a pri\u00ad\nmary developmental stage in the liver and then parasitize erythrocytes. \nP falciparum and P malariae have only one cycle ofliver cell invasion. \nThe other species have a dormant hepatic stage responsible for recur\u00ad\nrent infections and relapses. A fifth species, P lmow/esi, has been recog\u00ad\nnized as a human pathogen but little is known about it. Primary tissue \nschiwnticides (cg, primaquine) kill schiwnts in the liver, whereas \nblood schiwntic:ides (eg, chloroquine, artemisinins, quinine) kill \nthese forms only in erythrocytes.

Classification and pharmacokinetics-Chloroquine is a \n4-aminoquinoline derivative. The drug is rapidly absorbed when \n440 given orally, is widely distributed to tissues, and has an extremely \nlarge volume of distribution. Antacids may decrease oral absorp\u00ad\ntion of the drug. Chloroquine is excreted largely unchanged in the \nurine. \n2. Mechanism of action-Chloroquine accumulates in the food \nvacuole of plasmodia and prevents polymerization of the hemoglo\u00ad\nbin breakdown product heme into hemozoin. Intracellular accu\u00ad\nmulation of heme is toxic to the parasite. Decreased intracellular \naccumulation via increased activity of membrane transporters is \na mechanism of resistance to chloroquine and other antimalarial \ndrugs. Resistance in P falciparum can also result from decreased \nintravacuolar accumulation of chloroquine via a transporter encoded \nby the PfCRT (P fo/ciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter) \ngene. \n3.

The drug is solely a blood schizonti\u00ad\ncide. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are also used in auto\u00ad\nimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, but have been \nshown to be without effect in COVID-19 . \n4. Toxicity-At low doses, chloroquine causes gastrointestinal \nirritation, skin rash, and headaches. High doses may cause severe \nskin lesions, peripheral neuropathies, myocardial depression, reti\u00ad\nnal damage, auditory impairment, and toxic psychosis. Chloro\u00ad\nquine may also precipitate porphyria attacks. \nB. Artesunate, Artemether, Dihydroartemisinin \nThese artemisinin (qinghaosu) derivatives are metabolized in the \nfood vacuole of the parasite, forming toxic free radicals. Artemisi\u00ad\nnins are blood schizonticides active against P falciparum, includ\u00ad\ning multidrug-resistant strains. An intravenous form of artesunate \nis available for severe infections. These drugs are not used alone \nfor chemoprophylaxis because of their short half-lives of 1-3 h. \nHowever, they are now considered the first choice for chloroquine\u00ad\nresistant malaria in most countries. They are best used in combina\u00ad\ntion with other agents. The anemisinins are the only drugs reliably \neffective against quinine-resistant strains. Adverse effects are mild, \nbut include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Artemisinins do not \nalter rates of congenital abnormalities, stillbirths , and abortion in \npregnant women. \nC.Quinine \n1. Classification and pharmacokinetics-Quinine is rapidly \nabsorbed orally and is metabolized before renal excretion. Intra\u00ad\nvenous administration of quinine is possible in severe infections. 2. Mechanism of action-Quinine complexes with double\u00ad\nstranded DNA to prevent strand separation, resulting in block of \nDNA replication and transcription to RNA. Quinine is solely a \nblood schizonticide. \n3. Clinical use-The main use of quinine is in P falciparum \ninfections resistant to chloroquine in patients who can tolerate \noral treatment. Quinine is commonly used with doxycycline or \nclindamycin to shorten the duration of therapy and limit toxic\u00ad\nity. Quinidine , the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of quinine, is used \nintravenously in the treatment of severe or complicated falciparum \nmalaria. To delay emergence of resistance, quinine should not be \nused routinely for prophylaxis. \n4. Toxicity-Quinine commonly causes cinchonism (gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal distress, headache, vertigo, blurred vision, and tinnitus). \nSevere overdose results in disturbances in cardiac conduction that \nresemble quinidine toxicity. Hematotoxic effects occur, includ\u00ad\ning hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenas e (G6PD)\u00ad\ndeficient patients. Black.water &ver (intravascular hemolysis) is a \nrare and sometimes fatal complication in quinine-sensitized per\u00ad\nsons. Quinine is contraindicated in pregnancy. \nD. Mefloquine \n1. Classification and pharmacokinetics-Mefloquine is a \nsynthetic 4-quinoline derivative. Because oflocal irritation, meflo\u00ad\nquine can only be given orally, although it is subject to variable \nabsorption. Its mechanism of action is not known. \n2.

Tafenoquine is slowly excreted in the \nurine. \n2. Mechanism of action-Primaquinc forms quinolinc-quinonc \nmetabolites, which arc electron-transferring redox compounds \nthat act as cellular oxidants. The drug is a tissue schizonticidc and \nalso limits malaria transmission by acting as a garnctocidc . T afcno\u00ad\nquinc may work similarly. \n3. Clinical use-Primaquine and tafenoquinc eradicate liver \nstages of P vivax and P ovak and should be used in conjunction \nwith a blood schizonticidc. Although not active alone in acute \nattacks of vivax and ovalc malaria, a 14-d course of primaquinc \nor a single dose of tafcnoquine is given after treatment with chlo\u00ad\nroquine, and the drugs are also an alternative (daily) for primary \nprevention. Tafcnoquinc was approved in 2018 as another chc\u00ad\nmoprophylactic regimen, with simplified dosing (200 mg daily for \n3 d and then weekly). \n4. Toxlclty-Primaquine and tafenoquine are usually well toler\u00ad\nated but may cause gastrointestinal distress, pruritus, headaches, \nand methemoglobinemia. More serious toxicity for both prima\u00ad\nquine and tafcnoquine involves hemolysis in G6PD-dcficicnt \npatients. Primaquinc and tafcnoquinc arc contraindicated in \npregnancy. \nF. Antlfolate Drugs \n7. Classification and phannacoldnetics-The antifolate \ngroup includes pyrimcthamine, proguanil, sulfudoxine , and dap\u00ad\nsonc. All these drugs are absorbed orally and are excreted in the \nurine, partly in unchanged form. Proguanil has a shorter half-life \n(12-16 h) than other drugs in this subclass (half-life >100 h). \n2. Mechanisms of action-Sulfonamides act as antimctabo\u00ad\nlites of p--aminobcnzoic acid (PABA) and block folic acid synthe\u00ad\nsis in certain protozoan s by inhibiting dihydroptcroate synthase. \nProguanil (chloroguanidc) is bioactivated to cycloguanil. Pyri\u00ad\nmcthaminc and cycloguanil arc selective inhibitors of protozoan \ndihydrofolate reductases. The combination of pyrimethamine \nwith sulfudoxine has synergistic antimalarial effects through the sequential blockade of two steps in fulic acid synthesis (see \nFigure 46-1). \n3. Oinical use-The antifols are blood schizonticides that act \nmainly against P falciparum. Pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine in \nfixed combination (Fansidar) is used in the treatment of chloro\u00ad\nquine-resistant forms of this species, although the onset of activity is \nslow. Proguanil with atovaquone in fixed combination (Malarone) \ncan be used (daily) for chemoprophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant \nmalaria and is also protective against mcfloquine-rcsistant falci\u00ad\nparum strains. \n4. Toxicity-The toxic effects of sulfonamides include skin \nrashes, gastrointestinal distress, hemolysis, kidney damage, and \ndrug interactions caused by competition for plasma protein bind\u00ad\ning sites. Pyrimethamine may cause folic acid deficiency when \nused in high doses. \nG. Other Antlmalarlal Drugs \n1. Doxycydlne- This tetracycline is chemoprophylactic (taken \ndaily) for travelers to geographical areas with multidrug-resistant \nP falciparum. It is sometimes used in combination with quinine in \nactive falciparum infections. \n2. Amodlaqulne-This drug has been widely used to treat \nmalaria in many countries because of its low cost and, in some geo\u00ad\ngraphical areas, effectiveness against chloroquine-resistant strains \nof P falciparum. It is also used in fixed combination with artcsu\u00ad\nnate. Hematologic toxicity, including agranulocytosis and aplastic \nanemia, has been associated with the use of amodiaquine . \n3. Atovaquone- This quinine derivative , a component of \nMalarone (with proguanil), appears to disrupt mitochondrial \ndectron transport in protozoa. Malarone is effective for both che\u00ad\nmoprophylaxis (taken daily) and treatment of falciparum malaria. \nAbdominal pain and gastrointestinal effects occur at the higher \ndoses needed for treatment. Atovaquone is an alternative treat\u00ad\nment for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. \n4. Halofontrine-Although its mechanism of action is unknown, \nthis drug is active against erythrocytic (but not other) stages of all \nfour human malaria species, including chloroquine -resistant falci\u00ad\nparum. Halofantrine is not used for chemoprophylaxis because of \nits potential for quinidine-like cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation) \nand embryotoxicity . Lumefantrine, a related drug with mini\u00ad\nmal cardiotoxicity, is now used in fixed combination with arte\u00ad\nmether (Coartem) for uncomplicat ed falciparum malaria in many \ncountries. \nH. Drugs for the Prevention of Malaria in Travelers \nChloroquine (weekly) remains an appropriate agent for prophy\u00ad\nlaxis in regions without resistant P falciparum as does mdloquinc \n(weekly) in regions with P fo/ciparum resistance to chloroquine. \nIn areas with multidrug-rcsistant malaria, the choice is either \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

New York. NY: McGraw Hfll; 2021. CHAPTER 52 Antiprotozoal Drugs 443 \nfor treatment of severe intestinal or hepatic amebiasis together \nwith a luminal agent in hospitalized patients. The drugs may cause \nsevere toxicity, including gastrointestinal disuess, muscle weak\u00ad\nness, and cardiovascular dysfunction (arrhythmias and congestive \nheart failure). The drugs are restricted to use in severe amebiasis \nwhen metronidazole cannot be used. \nC. Metronidazole and Tinidazole \n1. Pharmacoklnetlcs-Metronidazole and tinidazole are effec\u00ad\ntive orally and distributed widdy to tissues. The half-life of meuo\u00ad\nnidazole is 6-8 h, and that of tinidazole 12-14 h. Elimination of \nthe drugs requires hepatic metabolism. \n2. Mechanism of action-Metronidazole undergoes a reductive \nbioactivation of its niuo group by ferredoxin (present in anaerobic \nparasites) to form reactive cytotoxic products. The mechanism of \ntinidazole is assumed to be similar. \n3. Clinical use-Metronidazole or tinidazole is the drug of choice \nin severe intestinal wall disease and in hepatic abscess and other \nextraintestinal amebic disease. Both drugs are used with a luminal \namebicide. The duration of treatment required with metronida\u00ad\nzole is longer than with tinidazole. Metronidazole is the drug of \nchoice for trichomoniasis; tinidazole may be effective against some \nmetronidazole-resistant organisms. Other clinical uses of metroni\u00ad\ndazole include treatment of giardiasis {tinidazole is equally effec\u00ad\ntive}, and infections caused by Gardnerel/a vagina/is and anaerobic \nbacteria (Bacteroitks fragilis, Cwstridium difficik). Metronidazole is \nalso used in combination regimens for gastrointestinal ulcers asso\u00ad\nciated with Helicobacter pywri. \n4. Toxicity-Adverse effects of metronidazole include gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal irritation (it is best taken with meals), headache, paresthe~ \nsias, and dark coloration of urine. Tinidazole has a similar adverse \neffect profile, but may be better tolerated than metronidazole. \nMore serious toxicity includes neutropenia, dizziness, and ataxia. \nDrug interactions with metronidazole include a disulfiram-like \nreaction with ethanol and potentiation of coumarin anticoagulant \neffects. Safety of metronidazole and tinidazole in pregnancy and in \nnursing mothers has not been established. \nD. Paromomycin \nThis drug is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used as a luminal amebi\u00ad\ncide and may be superior to diloxanide in asymptomatic infection. \nParomomycin may also have some efficacy against cryptosporidi\u00ad\nosis in the AIDS patient and in leishmaniasis. Systemic absorption \nin renal insufficiency may lead to headaches, dizziness, rashes, and \narthralgia. Tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline) are sometimes used with \na luminal amebicide in mild intestinal disease. \nE. lodoquinol \nIodoquinol, a halogenated hydroxyquinoline, is an orally active \nluminal amebicide used as an alternative to diloxanide for mild\u00ad\nto-severe intestinal infections. Adverse gastrointestinal effects are \ncommon but usually mild, especially when taken with meals."

Nitazoxanide \nThis agent has activity against various protozoans (including Ent-\u00ad\namoeba) and helminths. It is currently approved in the United States \nfor treatment of gastrointestinal infections caused by G /amblia and \nCryptosporidium parvum. Nitazoxanide appears to have activity \nagainst metronidazole-resistant protozoal strains. \nDRUGS FOR PNEUMOCVSTOSIS & \nTOXOPLASMOSIS \nA.TMP-SMZ \nf. Clinical use-TMP-SMZ is the first choice in prophylaxis \nand treatment of human Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which \nis now recognized to be due to P jirovecii; P carinii is an animal \npathogen. Prophylaxis in AIDS patients is recommended when \nthe CD4 count drops bdow 200 cells/\u00b5L. Oral treatment with the \ndouble-strength TMP-SMZ formulation 3 times weekly is usually \neffective. The same regimen ofTMP-SMZ is prophylactic against \ntoxoplasmosis and infections caused by Isospora belli. For treat\u00ad\nment of active PCP, daily oral or intravenous administration of \nTMP-SMZ is required. \n2. Toxicity-Adverse effects from TMP-SMZ occur in up to \n50% of AIDS patients. Toxicity includes gastrointestinal distress, \nrash, fever, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects may \nbe serious enough to warrant discontinuance of TMP-SMZ and \nsubstitution of alternative drugs. (See Chapter 46 for additional \ninformation on TMP-SMZ.) \nB. Pentamldlne \nJ. Mechanism of actlon-Pentamidine's mechanism of action \nis unknown but may involve inhibition of glycolysis or interfer\u00ad\nence with nucleic acid metabolism of protozoans and fungi. Pref\u00ad\nerential accumulation of the drug by susceptible parasites may \naccount for its sdective toxicity. \n2. Clinical use-Aerosol pentamidine (once monthly) can be \nused in primary and secondary prophylaxis of P jirovecii pneumo\u00ad\nnia, although oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is \nusually preferred. Daily intravenous or intramuscular administra\u00ad\ntion of the drug for 21 dis needed in the treatment of active pneu\u00ad\nmocystosis in the RN-infected patient. Pentamidine is also used \nin trypanosomiasis (see later discussion). \n3. Toxicity-Severe adverse effects follow parenteral use, includ\u00ad\ning respiratory stimulation followed by depression, hypotension \nresulting from peripheral vasodilation, hypoglycemia, anemia, \nneutropenia, hepatitis, and pancreatitis . Systemic toxicity is mini\u00ad\nmal when pentamidine is used by inhalation. C. Antifolates: Pyrimethamine and Sulfonamides \n1. Clinical use-Combination of pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine \nhas synergistic activity against T oxoplasma gondii through the sequen\u00ad\ntial blockade of two steps in folic acid synthesis (see Figure 46-1; like \ntrimethoprim, pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase). \nPyrimethamine plus clindamycin (or sulfadiazine) is a regimen of \nchoice for prophylaxis against and treatment of toxoplasmosis. For \ntreatment of active toxoplasmosis, the drug combination is given \ndaily for 3-4 weeks, with folinic acid to offset hematologic toxicity. \nFor Toxopl.asma encephalitis in AIDS, high-dose treatment with \npyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (or clindamycin) plus folinic acid \nmust be maintained for at least 6 weeks. \n2. Toxicity-High doses of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine are \nassociated with gastric irritation, glossitis, neurologic symptoms \n(headache, insomnia, tremors, seizures), and hematotoxicity (meg\u00ad\naloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia). Antibiotic-associated coli\u00ad\ntis may occur during treatment with clindamycin. \nD. Atovaquone \n1. Mechanism and pharmacoklnetlcs-Atovaquone inhibits \nmitochondrial dectron transport and probably folate metabolism. \nUsed orally, it is poorly absorbed and should be given with food \nto maximize bioavailability. Most of the drug is eliminated in the \nfeces in unchanged form. \n2. Clinical use and foxiclty-Atovaquone is approved for use \nin mild-to-moderate Pneumocystis pneumonia. It is less effective \nthan TMP-SMZ or pentamidine but is better tolerated. As noted, \nit is also used in combination with proguanil (as Malarone) for \nchemoprophylaxis and treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria. \nCommon adverse effects are rash, cough, nausea, vomiting, diar\u00ad\nrhea, fever, and abnormal liver function tests. The drug should be \navoided in patients with a history of cardiac conduction defects, \npsychiatric disorders, or seizures. \nE. Miscellaneous Agents \nOther alternative drug regimens for the treatment of Pneumocystis \npneumonia include trimethoprim plus dapsone, primaquine plus \nclindamycin, and trimetrexate plus leucovorin. \nDRUGS FOR TRYPANOSOMIASIS \nA. Pentamidine \nPentamidine is commonly used in the hemolymphatic stages \nof disease caused by Trypanosoma gambiense and T rhodesiense. \nBecause it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, pentamidine \nis not used in later stages of trypanosomiasis. Other clinical uses \ninclude Pneumocystis pneumonia and treatment of the kala azar \nform ofleishmaniasis {Table 52-3). \nB. Melarsoprol \nThis drug is an organic arsenical that inhibits enzyme sulfhydryl \ngroups.

However, treatment failures \ndo occur, possibly because of resistance. Mclarsoprol is given par\u00ad\nenterally because it causes gastrointestinal irritation; it may also \ncause a reactive encephalopathy that can be fatal. \nC. Nifurtimox \nThis drug is a nitrofurazone derivative that inhibits the parasite\u00ad\nuniq ue enzyme trypanothione reductase. Nifurtimox is the drug \nof choice in American trypanosomiasis, an alternative agent in \nAfrican forms of the disease, and has also been effective in muco\u00ad\ncutaneous leishmaniasis. The drug causes significant toxicity, \nincluding allergies, gastrointestinal irritation, and CNS effects. \nD.Suramln \nThis polyanionic compound is a drug of choice for the early hemo\u00ad\nlymphatic stages of African trypanosomiasis (before CNS involve\u00ad\nment). It is also an alternative to ivermectin in the treatment of \nonchocerciasis (see Chapter 53). Suramin is used parenterally \nand causes skin rashes, gastrointestinal distress, and neurologic \ncomplications. \nE. Eflornithine \nThis agent, a suicide substrate of ornithine decarboxylase, is effec\u00ad\ntive in some forms of African trypanosomiasis. It is available for \nboth oral and intravenous use and penetrates into the CNS. It \ncauses gastrointestinal irritation and hematotoxicity; seizures have \noccurred in overdose. \nF. Fexinidazole \nFainidazole is a DNA synthesis inhibitor approved by the \nEuropean Medicines Agency in 2018 for the treatment of early \nand advanced (CNS) West African trypanosomiasis in patients \naged ~6 years and weighing ~20 kg. This drug offers the first \noral therapy for trypanosomiasis. It is administered once daily for \n10 d. Fexinidazole is rapidly absorbed, with exposure increased when administered with food. Elimination is via nonrenal routes, \nwith a terminal elimination half-life of 9-15 h. Fexinidazole has \ndemonstrated equivalent efficacy to eflornithine plus nifurtimox \nfor the treatment of advanced disease, with success in over 90% \nof treated subjects. The drug has an acceptable safety profile, in \nparticular compared to older therapies, but adverse events include \nheadache, nausea. vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, weakness, tremor, \nand decreased appetite. \nDRUGS FOR LEISHMANIASIS \nLeishmania, parasitic protozoa transmitted by flesh-eating flies, \ncause various diseases ranging from cutaneous or mucocutancous \nlesions to splenic and hepatic enlargement with fever. Sodium \nstibogluconate (pentavalent antimony), the primary drug in all \nforms of the disease, appears to kill the parasite by inhibition of \nglycolysis or effects on nucleic acid metabolism. Stibogluconate \nmust be administered parenterally and is potentially cardiotoxic \ndue to QT prolongation. Alternative agents include pentamidine, \nparomomycin, or miltefosine (for visceral leishmaniasis), flucon\u00ad\nazole or metronidazole (for cutaneous lesions), and amphotericin \nB (for mucocutancous leishmaniasis). \nQUESTIONS \nI.

Many act against specific para\u00ad\nsites, and few are devoid of significant toxicity to host cells. In \naddition to the direct toxicity of the drugs, reactions to dead and dying parasites may cause serious toxicity in patients. In the \ntext that follows, the drugs are divided into three groups on \nthe basis of the type of helminth primarily affected (nematodes, \ntrematodes, and cestodes).

Pinworm infections are common \nthroughout the United States, and hookworm and threadworm arc \nendemic in the southern United States. Tissue nematodes responsive \nto drug therapy include Ancylortoma species, which cause cutaneous \nlarva migrans. Species of Dracunculus, Onchocm:a, T oxocara, and \nWuchemia bancrofti (the cause of filariasis) are responsive to drug \ntreatment. The number of persons worldwide estimated to be infected \nby tissue nematodes exceeds 0.5 billion. A. Albendazole \n1. Mechanisms- The action of albendazole is thought to involve \ninhibition of microtubu1e assembly. The drug is larvicidal in asca\u00ad\nriasis, cysticercosis, hookworm, and hydatid disease and is ovicidal \nin ascariasis, ancylostomiasis, and trichuriasis. \n2. Clinical use-Albendazole has a wide antihelminthic spec\u00ad\ntrum. It is a primary drug for ascariasis, hookworm, pinworm, \nand whipworm infections and an alternative drug for treatment of \nthreadworm infections, ftlariasis, and both visceral and cutaneous \nlarva migrans. Albendazole is also used in hydatid disease and is \nactive against the pork tapeworm in the larval stage (cysticerco\u00ad\nsis). Albendazole is administered on an empty stomach when used \nagainst intralwninal parasites but given with a fatty meal when \nused against tissue parasites. \n449"

However, a reversible leukopenia, alopecia, and \ndevation of liver function enzymes can occur with more prolonged \nuse for hydatid disease. Long~term animal toxicity studies have \ndescribed bone marrow suppression and fetal toxicity. The safety of \nthe drug in pregnancy and young children has not been established. lymphangitis. In onchocerciasis, the reactions are more intense and \ninclude most of the symptoms described as well as hypotension, \npyrexia, respiratory distress, and prostration (weakness/exhaustion). \nB. Dlethylcarbamazlne \n1. Mechanlsms-Diethylcarbamazine immobilizes microfilariae \nand alters their surface structure, displacing them from tissues \nand making them more susceptible to destruction by host defense \nmechanisms. The mode of action against adult worms is unknown. \n2. Clinical use--Diethylcarbamazine is the drug of choice for \nseveral filarial infections including those caused by W bancrofti and \nBrugia malayi and for eye worm disease (Loa loa). The drug under\u00ad\ngoes renal elimination, and its half-life is increased significantly by \nurinary alkalinization. \n3. Toxicity-Adverse effects include headache, malaise, weak\u00ad\nness, and anorexia. Reactions to proteins released by dying filariae \ninclude fever, rashes, ocular damage, joint and muscle pain, and C. lvermectln \n1. Mechanlsms-Ivcrmectin intensifies y-aminobutyric acid \n(GABA)~mediated neurotransmission in nematodes and causes \nimmobilization of parasites, facilitating their removal by the retic\u00ad\nuloendothdial system. Sdective toxicity results because in humans \nGABA is a neurotransmitter only in the CNS, and ivermectin does \nnot cross the blood-brain barrier. \n2. Clinical use--Ivermectin is the drug of choice for onchocer~ \nciasis, cutaneous larva migrans, strongyloidiasis, and some forms \nof filariasis. lvermectin also now plays a key role in onchocerciasis \ncontrol. Annual mass treatments have led to major reductions in \ndisease transmission. lvermectin is under study for the control of \nmalaria transmission due to activity against mosquitoes feeding on \ntreated subjects. \n3.

These symptoms are usually of shon \nduration, and most can be controlled with antihistamines and non\u00ad\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Avoid other drugs that enhance \nGABA activity. lvermectin should not be used in pregnancy. \nD. Moxidectin \n1. Mechanisms-Studies with other nematodes suggest that \nmoxidectin binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl), \ngamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and/or ATP-binding \ncassette (ABC) transporters. This leads to increased permeability, \ninflux of chloride ions, hyperpolarization, and paralysis. \n2. Clinical use-Moxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone, was approved \nby the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in persons \ni!: 12 years old. The drug has also demonstrated activity for strongy\u00ad\nloidiasis and trichuriasis, although it was not superior to standard \ntreatments for these infections. \n3. Toxicity-Adverse events with moxidectin in those with \nonchocerciasis have included pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, head\u00ad\nache, tachycardia, and rash. \nE. Mebendazole \n1. Mechanism-Mebendazole acts by selectively inhibiting \nmicrotubule synthesis and glucose uptake in nematodes. \n2. Clinical use-Mebendazole is a primary drug for treatment of \nascariasis and for pinworm and whipworm infections. Mebenda\u00ad\nzole has also been used as a backup drug in visceral larval migrans. \nLess than 10% of the drug is absorbed systemically after oral \nuse, and this ponion is metabolized rapidly by hepatic enzymes. \nPlasma levels may be decreased by carbamazepine or phenytoin \nand increased by cimetidine. \n3. Toxicity-Mebendazole toxicity is usually limited to gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal irritation, but at high doses granulocytopenia and alopecia \nhave occurred. The drug is teratogenic in animals and therefore \ncontraindicated in pregnancy. It should be used with caution in \nchildren younger than 2 years because of limited experience and \nrare reports of convulsions in this age group. \nF. Piperazine \n1. Mechanism-Piperazine paralyzes Ascaris by blocking ace\u00ad\ntylcholine at the myoneural junction. The live paralyzed round\u00ad\nworms are expelled by normal peristalsis. \n2. Clinical use-Piperazine is an alternative drug for ascariasis. \n3. Toxicity-Mild gastrointestinal irritation is the most common \nside effect. Piperazine should not be used in pregnant patients or \nthose with hepatic or renal dysfunction or seizure disorders. \nG. Pyrantel Pamoate \n1.Mechanism-Pyrantel pamoate stimulates nicotinic receptors \npresent at neuromuscular junctions of nematodes. Contraction of muscles occurs, followed by a depolarization-induced paralysis. \nThe drug has no actions on flukes or tapeworms. \n2. Clinical use-Pyrantel pamoate has wide activity against nem\u00ad\natodes, killing adult worms in the colon but not the eggs. It is a \ndrug of choice for hookworm and roundworm infections and an \nalternative drug for pinworrns. The drug is poorly absorbed when \ngiven orally. \n3. Toxicity-Adverse effects are minor but include gastrointesti\u00ad\nnal distress, headache, and weakness. Use with caution in patients \nwith hepatic dysfunction. \nH. Thiabendazole \n1. Mechanism- Thiabendazole is a structural congener of \nmebendazole and has a similar action on microtubules. \n2. Clinical use-Because ofits adverse effects, thiabendazole is an \nalternative drug in strongyloidiasis and trichinosis (adult worms). \nThiabendazole is rapidly absorbed from the gut and is metabolized \nby liver enzymes. The drug has anti-inflammatory and immu\u00ad\nnorestorative actions in the host. \n3. Toxlclty-Thiabendazole is much more toxic than other benz\u00ad\nimidazoles or ivermectin, so these other drugs are preferred. Its toxic \neffects include gastrointestinal irritation, headache, dizziness, drows\u00ad\niness, leukopenia, hematuria, and allergic reactions, including intra\u00ad\nhepatic cholestasis. Reactions caused by dying parasites include \nfever, chills, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. Irreversible liver fail\u00ad\nure and fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported. \nAvoid in pregnant patients or those with hepatic or renal disease. \nSKILL KEEPER: ANTIMICROBIAL \nCHEMOTHERAPY IN PREGNANCY \nMebendazo/e is widely used for the treatment of nematode \ninfections but is contraindicated in the pregnant patient \nbecause of possible embryotoxicity. \n1. Which drugs used for the treatment of bacterial, fungai \nprotozoa/, and viral infections are assodated with a \ngreater risk compared with benefit in pregnancy? \n2. Which drugs are nominally contraindicated in pregnancy \nbut might be used if the benefit were judged to outweigh \nthe risk? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nDRUGS THAT ACT AGAINST \nTREMATODES \nThe medically important trematodes include Schistosoma species \n(blood flukes, estimated to affect more than 150 million persons \nworldwide), Clonorchis sinmsis (liver fluke, endemic in Southeast \nAsia), and Paragonimus westermani (lung fluke, endemic to both"

Mechanism-Praziquantd increases membrane permeability \nto calcium, causing marked contraction initially and then paralysis \nof trematode and cestode muscles; this is followed by vacuolization \nand parasite death. \n2. Clinical use-Praziquantel has a wide antihelminthic spectrum \nthat includes activity in both trematode and cestode infections. It \nis the drug of choice in schistosomiasis (all species), clonorchiasis, \nand paragonimiasis and for infections caused by small and large \nintestinal flukes. The drug is active against immature and adult \nschistosomal forms. Praziquantel is also one of two drugs of choice \n(with niclosamide) for infections caused by cestodes (all common \ntapeworms) and an alternative agent (to albendazole) in the treat\u00ad\nment of cysticercosis. \n3. Pharmacokinetics-Absorption from the gut is rapid, and \nthe drug is metabolized by the liver to inactive products. \n4. Toxicity-Common adverse effects include headache, dizzi\u00ad\nness and drowsiness, malaise, and, less frequently, gastrointestinal \nirritation, skin rash, and fever. Neurologic effects can occur in the \ntreatment of neurocysticercosis including intracranial hyperten\u00ad\nsion and seizures. Corticosteroid therapy reduces the risk of the \nmore serious reactions. Praziquantel is contraindicated in ocular \ncysticercosis. In animal studies, the drug increased abortion rate. \nB. Bithionol \nf. Clinical use-Bithionol is a codrug of choice (with triclabenda\u00ad\nzole) for treatment of fascioliasis (sheep liver fluke) and an alterna\u00ad\ntive agent in paragonimiasis (lung fluke). The mechanism of action \nof the drug is unknown. Bithionol is orally effective and is elimi\u00ad\nnated in the urine. \n2. Toxicity-Common adverse effects of bithionol include nau\u00ad\nsea and vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, dizziness, \nheadache, skin rash (possibly a reaction to dying worms}, and \nphototoxicity . Less frequently, pyrexia, tinnitus, proteinuria. and \nleukopenia may occur. \nC. Metrifonate \nMetrifonate is an organophosphate prodrug that is convened in \nthe body to the cholinesterase inhibitor dichlorvos. The active \nmetabolite acts solely against Schistosoma hannatobi1'm (the cause \nofbilharziasis). Toxic effects occur from excess cholinergic stimu\u00ad\nlation. The drug is contraindicated in pregnancy. Metrifonate is a \nsafe, low-cost alternative drug for the treatment of S hamuuobium \ninfections . It is not available in the USA. \nD. Oxamniquine \nOxamniquine is effective solely in Schistosoma mansoni infections \n(intestinal bilharziasis), acting on male immature forms and adult schistosomal forms. The drug causes paralysis of the worms, but \nits precise mechanism is unknown. Dizziness is a common adverse \neffect (no driving for 24 h); headache, gastrointestinal irritation, \nand pruritus may also occur. Reactions to dying parasites include \neosinophilia, unicaria, and pulmonary infiltrates. It is not advis\u00ad\nable to use oxamniquine in pregnancy or in patients with a history \nof seizure disorders. It has been used extensively for mass treat\u00ad\nment. It is not available in the USA. \nE. Trlclabendazole \n1. Mechanisms- T riclabendazole is a structural congener of \nmebendazole and has a similar action on microtubules. \n2. Clinical use-The benzimidazole triclabendazole has been the \ndrug of choice to treat fascioliasis in adults for many years, and \nit was approved by the FDA in 2019 for this purpose in persons \n<!:6 years of age. \n3. Toxicity-The most common adverse reactions have been \nabdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, vertigo, nausea, unicaria, vomit\u00ad\ning, and headache. The drug may prolong the QT interval. \nDRUGS THAT ACT AGAINST CESTODES \n(TAPEWORMS) \nThe four medically imponant cestodes are T amia saginata (beef \ntapeworm), Tamia solium (pork tapeworm, which can cause cys~ \nticerci in the brain and the eyes), Diphy/lobothrium latum (fish \ntapeworm), and Echinococcu.s granulosus (dog tapeworm, which \ncan cause hydatid cysts in the liver, lungs, and brain). The pri~ \nmary drugs for treatment of cestode infections are praziquantel \n(see prior discussion) and niclosamide. \nA. Nlclosamlde \n1. Mechanism-Niclosamide may act by uncoupling oxidative \nphosphorylation or by activating ATPases. \n2. Clinical use-Niclosamide is an alternative drug to praziqu\u00ad\nantel for infections caused by beef, pork, and fish tapeworm. It \nis not effective in cysticercosis (for which albendazole or praziqu\u00ad\nantel is used) or hydatid disease caused by Echinococcu.s granu/osus \n(for which albendazole is used). Scoleces and cestode segments are \nkilled, but ova are not. Niclosamide is effective in the treatment of \ninfections from small and large intestinal flukes. It is not available \nin the United States. \n3. Toxicity-Toxic effects are usually mild but include gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal distress, headache, rash, and fever. Some of these effects \nmay result from systemic absorption of antigens from disintegrat\u00ad\ning parasites. Ethanol consumption should be avoided for 24--48 h. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Pyrantel pamoate, an agonise at nicotinic receptors, is equiva\u00ad\nlent to albendazole and mebendazole in the treatment of \ncommon nematode infections. It acts on adult worms in the \ncolon, but not on eggs. The drug causes only mild gastroin\u00ad\ntestinal side effects and is not hepatotoxic. It is not effective in \nthe treatment of infections caused by cestodes or flukes. The \nanswerisC. \n4. Oxamniquine may cause seizures, especially in persons with a \nhistory of convulsive disorders. Such persons should be hos\u00ad\npitalized or treated with praziquantel. Oxamniquine is effec\u00ad\ntive in all stages of disease caused by S mansoni, including \nadvanced hepatosplenomegaly, and it has been used exten\u00ad\nsively for mass treatment. The drug is not effective in other \nschistosomal diseases, and it is contraindicated in pregnancy. \nThe answer is A. \nS. Praziquantel is a primary drug for treatment of infections \ncaused by the Oriental liver fluke and by the fish tapeworm. \nBoth types of infection arc transmitted mainly via the con\u00ad\nsumption of raw fish. Niclosamide is also a primary drug for \nfish tapeworm infections, but it is not active against Clonor\u00ad\nchis sinensis. Albendazole is not effective in fish tapeworm \ninfections, but it is useful in the pork tapeworm larval stage \n(cysticercosis). Pyrantd pamoate is not active against cestodes \nor trematodes. The answer is D. \n6. In hydatid disease, praziquantel has marginal efficacy because \nit does not affect the inner germinal membrane of Echinococ\u00ad\ncus granulosus present in hydatid cysts.

In the United States a drug used to be designated (by the \nFDA) as Pregnancy Risk Category\u2022 X if the risk of its use \nin pregnancy was judged to be greater than any possible \nbenefit. Such drugs had been established to cause fetal \nabnormalities or miscarriage in humans. This category \nincludes the antiviral agent ribavirin and the antimalarial \ndrug quinine. Clomiphene, ergots, ethionamide, HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors, isotretinoin, misoprostol, conjugated \nestrogens, and thalidomide are also category X drugs. \n2. For drugs in FDA Pregnancy Risk Category D, there is \nevidence of human risk, but their potential benefit may \noutweigh such risk.

On the one hand, use of cytotoxic anticancer drugs \nproduces high rates of cure of a few cancers, which, without \nchemotherapy, result in extremdy high mortality rates (eg, \nacute lymphocytic leukemia in children, testicular cancer, and \nHodgkin lymphoma).

            "Text": "C. Resistance to Anticancer Drugs \nDrug resistance is a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. \nMechanisms of resistance include the following: \nJ. Increased DNA repair-An increased rate of DNA repair \nin tumor cells can be responsible for resistance and is particularly \nimportant for alkylating agents and cisplatin. \n2. Formation of trapping agents-Some tumor cells increase \ntheir production of thiol trapping agents (cg, glutathione), which \ninteract with anticancer drugs that form reactive electrophilic spe\u00ad\ncies. This mechanism of resistance is seen with the alkylating agent \nbleomycin, cisplatin, and the anthracyclines. \n3. Changes in target enzymes-Changes in the drug sensitiv\u00ad\nity of a target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, and increased syn\u00ad\nthesis of the enzyme are mechanisms of resistance of tumor cells \nto methotrexate. \n4. Decreased activation of prodmgs-Resistance to the \npurine antimetabolites (mercaptopurine, thioguanine) and the \npyrimidine antimetabolites (cytarabine, fluorouracil} can result \nfrom a decrease in the activity of the tumor cell enzymes needed to \nconvert these prodrugs to their cytotoxic metabolites. \n5. Inactivation of anticancer dmgs-Increased actlVlty of \nenzymes capable of inactivating anticancer drugs is a mechanism \nof tumor cell resistance to most of the purine and pyrimidine \nantimetabolites. \n6. Decreased drug accumulation-This form of multidrug \nresistance involves the increased expression of a normal gene \n(MDRI) for a cell surface glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein}. This \ntransport molecule is involved in the accelerated efflux of many \nanticancer drugs in resistant cells. \nSTRATEGIES IN CANCER \nCHEMOTHERAPY \nA. cancer Treatment Modalities \nChemotherapy is used in three main clinical settings: \nJ. Primary induction chemotherapy-Drug therapy is \nadministered as the primary treatment for many hematologic can\u00ad\ncers and for advanced solid tumors for which no alternative treat\u00ad\nment exists. Although primary induction can be curative in a small \nnumber of patients who present with advanced metastatic disease \n(eg, lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, germ cell cancer, \nchoriocarcinoma, and several childhood cancers), in many cases \nthe goals of therapy are palliation of cancer symptoms, improved \nquality of life, and increased time to tumor progression. \n2. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy-The use of chemotherapy in \npatients who present with localized cancer for which alternative CHAPTER 54 Cancer Chemotherapy 457 \nlocal therapy, such as surgery, exists is known as neoadjuvant che\u00ad\nmotherapy. The goal is to reduce the size of the tumor so that \nsurgical resection is more feasible or more effective. \n3. Adjuvant chemotherapy-In the treatment of many solid \ntumors, chemotherapy serves as an important adjuvant to local \ntreatment procedures such as surgery or radiation. The goal is to \nreduce the risk of local and systemic recurrence and to improve \ndisease-free and overall survival. \nB. Prlnclples of Combination Therapy \nChemotherapy with combinations of anticancer drugs usually \nincreases log-kill markedly, and in some cases synergistic effects \nare achieved. Combinations are often cytotoxic to a heterogeneous \npopulation of cancer cells and may prevent development of resis\u00ad\ntant clones. Drug combinations using CCS and CCNS drugs may \nbe cytotoxic to both dividing and resting cancer cells. The follow\u00ad\ning principles are important for selecting appropriate drugs to use \nin combination chemotherapy: \n(I) Each drug should be active when used alone against the par-\nticular cancer. \n(2) The drugs should have different mechanisms of action. \n(3) Cross-resistance between drugs should be minimal. \n(4) The drugs should have different toxic effects (fable 54-1). \nC. Rescue Therapy \nToxic effects of anticancer drugs can sometimes be alleviated by \nrescue strategy. For example, high doses of methotrexate may be \ngiven for 36--48 h and terminated before severe toxicity occurs to \ncells of the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. Leucovorin, a \nform of tetrahydrofolate that is accumulated more readily by nor\u00ad\nmal than by neoplastic cells, is then administered. This results in \nrescue of the normal cells because leucovorin bypasses the dihydro\u00ad\nfolate reductase step in folic acid synthesis. \nMercaptoethanesulfonate (mesna) \"traps\" acrolein released \nfrom cyclophosphamide and thus reduces the incidence of hemor\u00ad\nrhagic cystitis. Deuazoxane inhibits free radical formation and \naffords protection against the cardiac toxicity of anthracyclines \n(eg, doxorubicin). \nALKYLATING AGENTS \nThe alkylating agents include nitrogen mustards (chlorambucil, \ncydophospham.ide, mec:hloretham.ine), nitrosoureas (carm.w\u00ad\ntine, lomustine), and alkyl sulfonates (busulfan}. Other drugs \nthat act in part as alkylating agents include cisplatin, dacarbazine, \nand procarbazine. \nThe alkylating agents are CCNS drugs. They form reactive \nmolecular species that alkylate nucleophilic groups on DNA bases, \nparticularly the N-7 position of guanine. This leads to cross-linking of \nbases, abnormal base-pairing, and DNA strand breakage. Tumor \ncell resistance to the drugs occurs through increased DNA repair, \ndecreased drug permeability, and the production of trapping \nagents such as thiols."

Cyclophosphamide \nf. Pharmacokinetics-Hepatic cytochrome P450-mediated \nbiotransformation of cyclophosphamide is needed for antiturnor \nactivity. One of the breakdown products is acrolein. \n2. Clinical use-Uses of cyclophosphamide include leuke\u00ad\nmia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast and ovarian cancers, and \nneuroblastoma. \n3. Toxicity-Gastrointestinal distress, mydosuppression, and \nalopecia are expected adverse effects of cyclophosphamide. Hem\u00ad\norrhagic cystitis resulting from the formation of acrolein may be \ndecreased by vigorous hydration and by use of mercaptoethane\u00ad\nsulfunate (mesna). Cyclophosphamide may also cause cardiac dys\u00ad\nfunction, pulmonaty toxicity, and a syndrome of inappropriate \nantidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. B. Mechlorethamine \n1.

Clinical use-Mechlorethamine is best known for use in regi\u00ad\nmens for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n3. Toxicity-Gastrointestinal distress, myelosuppression, alope\u00ad\ncia, and sterility are common. Mechlorethamine has marked vesi\u00ad\ncant (blister-forming) actions. \nC. Platlnum Analogs (Clsplatln, Carboplatln, Oxallplatln) \n1. Pharmacoldnetlcs- The platinum agents are used intra\u00ad\nvenously; the drugs distribute to most tissues and arc cleared in \nunchanged form by the kidney. \n2. Clinical use-Cisplatin is commonly used as a component of \nregimens for testicular carcinoma and for cancers of the bladder, \nlung, and ovaty. Carboplatin has similar uses. Oxaliplatin is used \nin advanced colon cancer. \n3. Toxicity-Cisplatin causes gastrointestinal distress and mild \nhematotoxicity and is neurotoxic (peripheral neuritis and acoustic \nnerve damage) and nephrotoxic. Renal damage may be reduced \nby the use of mannitol with forced hydration. Carboplatin is less \nnephrotoxic than cisplatin and is less likely to cause tinnitus and \nhearing loss, but it has greater mydosuppressant actions. Oxalipla\u00ad\ntin causes dose-limiting ncurotoxicity. \nD. Procarbazine \n1. Mechanlsms-Procarbazine is a reactive agent that forms \nhydrogen peroxide, which generates free radicals that cause DNA \nstrand scission. \n2. Pharmacoldnetlcs-Procarbazine is orally active and pen\u00ad\netrates into most tissues, including the ccrebrospinal fluid. It is \neliminated via hepatic metabolism. \n3. Clinical use-The primaty use of the drug is as a component \nof regimens for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and brain \ntumors. \n4.

It causes alopecia, \nskin rash, gastrointestinal distress, myelosuppression, phototoxicr \nity, and a flu-like syndrome. \nANTI METABOLITES \nThe antimetabolites are structurally similar to endogenous com\u00ad\npounds and are antagonists of folic acid (methotraate), purines \n(mercaptopurine, tbioguanine), or pyrimidines (fluorouracil, \ncyta.ra.bine, gcm.citabine). Antimetabolites are CCS drugs act\u00ad\ning primarily in the S phase of the cdl cycle. In addition to their \ncytotoxic effects on neoplastic cdls, the antimetabolites also have \nimmunosuppressant actions (see also Chapters 36 and 55). \nA. Methotrexate \n1. Mechanisms of action and resistance-Methotrexate \nis an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. This action leads to a \ndecrease in the synthesis of thymidylate, purine nucleotides, and \namino acids and thus interferes with nucleic acid and protein \nmetabolism (see Figure 33-2 for folate-dependent enzymatic reac\u00ad\ntions). The intracellular formation and trapping of polyglutamate \nderivatives of methotrexate appear to be important for cytotoxic \nactions. Tumor cell resistance mechanisms include decreased drug \naccumulation, changes in the drug sensitivity or activity of dihy\u00ad\ndrofolate reductase, and decreased formation of polyglutamates. \n2. Pharmacoklnetlcs-Oral and intravenous administration of \nmethotrexate affords good tissue distribution except to the CNS. \nMethotrexate is not metabolized, and its clearance is dependent on \nrenal function. Adequate hydration is needed to prevent Ctylital\u00ad\nlization in renal tubules. \n3. Clinical use-Methotrexate is effective in choriocarcinoma, \nacute leukemias, non-Hodgkin and primary central nervous sys\u00ad\ntem lymphomas, and a number of solid tumors, including breast \ncancer, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer. Methotrexate \nis used also (at lower doses) in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis (see \nChapter 36), and ectopic pregnancy. \n4. Toxicity-Common adverse effects of methotrexate include \nbone marrow suppression and toxic effects on the skin and gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal mucosa (mucositis). The toxic effects of methotrexate \non normal cells may be reduced by administration of folinic acid \n(leucovorin); this strategy is called leucovorin rescue. Long-term \nuse of methotrexate has led to hepatotoxicity and to pulmonary \ninfiltrates and fibrosis. \nB. Mercaptopurine and Thioguanine \n1. Mechanisms of action and resistance-Mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) and thioguanine (6-TG) are purine antimetabolites. \nBoth drugs are activated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphori\u00ad\nbosyltransferases (HGPRTases) to toxic nucleotides that inhibit \nseveral enzymes involved in purine metabolism. Resistant tumor CHAPTER 54 Cancer Chemotherapy 459 \ncells have a decreased activity ofHGPRTase, or they may increase \ntheir production of alkaline phosphatases that inactivate the toxic \nnucleotides. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-Mercaptopurine and thioguanine have \nlow oral bioavailability because of first-pass metabolism by hepatic \nenzymes. The metabolism of 6-MP by xanthine oxidase is inhib\u00ad\nited by the xanthine oxidase inhibitors allopurinol and febux.ostat. \n3. Clinical use-Purine antimetabolites are used mainly in the \nacute leukemias and chronic myelocytic leukemia. \n4. Toxicity-Bone marrow suppression is dose limiting, but \nhepatic dysfunction {cholestasis, jaundice, necrosis) also occurs. \nC. Fluorouracil \n1. Mechanlsms-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is converted in cdls to \n5-fluoro-2' -deoxyuridine-5' -mono phosphate (5-FdUMP), which \ninhibits thymidylate synthase and leads to \"thymindess death\" of \ncells. Incorporation ofFdUMP into DNA inhibits DNA synthesis \nand function while incorporation of5-fluorouridine-5' -triphosphate \n(FUTP), another 5-FU metabolite, into RNA interferes with RNA \nprocessing and function. Tumor cell resistance mechanisms include \ndecreased activation of 5-FU, increased thyrnidylate synthase activ\u00ad\nity, and reduced drug sensitivity of this enzyme. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-When given intravenously, fluorouracil \nis widdy distributed, including into the cerebrospinal fluid. Elimi\u00ad\nnation is mainly by metabolism. \n3. Clinical use-Fluorouracil is used in bladder, breast, colon, \nanal, head and neck, liver, and ovarian cancers. The drug can be \nused topically for keratoses and superficial basal cdl carcinoma. \n4. Toxicity-Gastrointestinal distress, myelosuppression, and \nalopecia are common. \nD. Cytarabine \n1. Mechanisms of action and reslstance-Cytarabine (Ara-C) \n(cytosine arabinoside) is a pyrimidine antimetabolite. The drug is \nactivated by kinases to AraCTP, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases. \nOf all the antimetabolites, cytarabine is the most specific for the S \nphase of the cdl cycle. Resistance to cytarabine can occur as a result \nof its decreased uptake or its decreased conversion to AraCTP. \nE. Gemcltablne \n1. Mechanisms-Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analog that is \nconverted into the active diphosphate and triphosphate nucleotide \nform. Gemcitabine diphosphate appears to inhibit ribonucleotide \nreductase and thereby diminish the pool of deoxyribonucleoside tri\u00ad\nphosphates required for DNA synthesis. Gemcitabine triphosphate \ncan be incorporated into DNA, where it causes chain termination. \n2. Pharmacoklnetlcs-Elimination is mainly by metabolism."

Toxicity-Primarily mydosuppression occurs, mainly as neu\u00ad\ntropenia. Pulmonary toxicity has been observed. \nNATURAL PRODUCT ANTICANCER \nDRUGS \nThe most important of these plant-derived, CCS drugs are the \nvinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine), the podo\u00ad\nphyllotorins (etoposide, teniposide), the camptothecins (topote\u00ad\ncan, irinotec:an), and the taxanes (paclitud., docetaxel). \nA. Vlnblastlne, Vlncrlstlne, andVlnorelblne \n1. Mechanisms-The vinca alkaloids block the formation of \nthe mitotic spindle by preventing the assembly of tubulin dimers \ninto microtubules. They act primarily in the M phase of the cancer \ncell cycle. Resistance can occur from increased effiux of the drugs \nfrom tumor cells via the membrane drug transporter. \n2. Pharmacokinetics- These drugs must be given parenterally. \nThey penetrate most tissues except the cerebrospinal fluid. They \nare cleared mainly via biliary excretion. \n3. Clinical use-Vmcristine is used in acute leukemias, lym\u00ad\nphomas, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma. Vmblastine is used \nfor lymphomas, neuroblastoma, testicular carcinoma, and Kaposi \nsarcoma. Vmorelbine is used in non-small cdl lung cancer and \nbreast cancer. \n4. Toxicity-Vinblastine and vinordbine cause gastrointestinal \ndistress, alopecia, and bone marrow suppression. Vmcristine does \nnot cause serious myelosuppression but has neurotoxic actions and \nmay cause areflexia, peripheral neuritis, and paralytic ileus. \nB. Etoposlde and Tenlposlde \n1. Mechan/sms-Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of \npodophyllotoxin, induces DNA breakage through its inhibition of \ntopoisomerase II. The drug is most active in the late S and early G2 \nphases of the cell cycle. Tenipmide is an analog with very similar \npharmacologic characteristics. \n2. Pharmacokinetics-Etoposide is wdl absorbed after oral \nadministration and distributes to most body tissues. Elimination \nof etoposide is mainly via the kidnC)75, and dose reductions should \nbe made in patients with renal impairment. \n3. Cllnkal use-These agents are used in c.ombination drug regi\u00ad\nmens fur therapy of lymphoma and lung, germ cdl, and gastric \ncancers. 4.

Mechanisms-The two camptothecins, topotecan and irino\u00ad\ntecan, produce DNA damage by inhibiting topoisomerase I. They \ndamage DNA by inhibiting the enzyme that cuts and religates \nsingle DNA strands during normal DNA repair processes. \n2. Phannacolcinetics-Irinotecan is a prodrug that is c.onverted in \nthe liver into an active metabolite, SN-38. Topotecan is eliminated \nrenally, whereas irinotecan and its metabolite are diminated in the bile \nand feces. Genetic variation markedly affects irinotecan metabolism \n(see Chapter 5). Excessive gastrointestinal toxicity is seen in individu\u00ad\nals with variants ofUGTlA that result in low glucuronidation activity. \n3. Clinical use-Topotecan is used as second-line therapy for \nadvanced ovarian cancer and for small cell lung cancer. lrinotecan \nis used for metastatic colorectal cancer. \n4. Toxlclly-Myelosuppression and diarrhea are the two most \ncommon toxicities. \nD. Paclitaxel and Docetaxel \n1. Mechanisms-Paclitaxel and docetaxd interfere with the \nmitotic spindle. The taxanes act differently from vinca alkaloids, \nsince they prevent microtubule disassembly into tubulin monomers. \n2. Pharmacolcinetics-Paclitaxel and docetaxd are given \nintravenously. \n3. Clinical use-The taxanes have activity in a number of solid \ntumors, including breast, ovarian, lung, gastroesophageal, pros\u00ad\ntate, bladder, and head and neck cancers. \n4. Toxicity-Paclitaxel causes neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, a \nhigh incidence of peripheral neuropathy, and possible hypersen\u00ad\nsitivity reactions during infusion. Docetaxd causes neurotoxicity \nand bone marrow depression. \nANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS \nThis category of antineoplastic drugs is made up of several struc\u00ad\nturally dissimilar microbial products and includes the anthracy\u00ad\ndines, bleomycin, and mitomycio. \nA. Anthracyclines \n1. Mechanisms-The anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunoru\u00ad\nbicin, iclarubicin, epirubicin, mitountrone) intercalate between \nDNA base pairs, inhibit topoisomerase II, and generate free radi\u00ad\ncals. They block the synthesis of RNA and DNA and cause DNA \nstrand scission. Membrane disruption also occurs. Anthracyclines \nare CCNS drugs. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Clinical use-Doxorubicin is used in Hodgkin and non\u00ad\nHodgkin lymphoma, mydomas, sarcomas, and breast, lung, ovar\u00ad\nian, and thyroid cancers. The main use of daunorubicin is in the \ntreatment of acute leukemias. Idarubicin, a newer anthracycline, \nis approved for use in acute mydogenous leukemia. Epirubicin is \nused in breast cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Mitoxantrone is \nused in acute mydoid leukemias, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast \ncancer, and gastroesophageal cancer. \n4. Toxicity- These drugs cause bone marrow suppression, gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal distress, and severe alopecia. Their most distinctive \nadverse effect is cardiotoxicity, which includes initial dectrocar\u00ad\ndiographic abnormalities (with the possibility of arrhythmias) \nand slowly devdoping, lifetime cumulative dose-dependent car\u00ad\ndiomyopathy and heart failure. Dcuaou.nc, an inhibitor of \niron-mediated free radical generation, may protect against the \ndose-dependent form of cardiotoxicity. Liposomal formulations of \ndoxorubicin may be less cardiotoxic. \nB. Bleomycin \n7. Mechan/sms-Bleomycin is a mixture of glycopeptides that \ngenerates free radicals, which bind to DNA, cause strand breaks, \nand inhibit DNA synthesis. Bleomycin is a CCS drug active in the \nG2 phase of the tumor cell cycle. \n2. Pharmacoklnet/cs-Bleomyein must be given parenterally. \nIt is inactivated by tissue aminopeptidases, but some renal clear\u00ad\nance of intact drug also occurs. \n3. Clinical use-Bleomycin is a component of drug regimens for \nHodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer. It is also used for treat\u00ad\nment of lymphomas and for squamous cell carcinomas. \n4. Toxicity- The toxicity profile of bleomycin includes pulmo\u00ad\nnary dysfunction (pneumonitis, fibrosis), which devdops slowly \nand is dose limiting. Hypersensitivity reactions (chills, fever, ana\u00ad\nphylaxis) are common, as are mucocutaneous reactions (alopecia, \nblister formation, hyperkeratosis). \nC. Mltomycln \n7. Mechanisms and phannacokinetics-Mitomyein is a CCNS \ndrug that is metabolized by liver enzymes to form an alkylating \nagent that cross-links DNA. Mitomycin is given intravenously and \nis rapidly cleared via hepatic metabolism. \n2. Clinical use-Mitomydn acts against hypoxic tumor cells and \nis used in combination regimens for adenocarcinomas of the cer\u00ad\nvix, stomach, pancreas, and lung. \n3. Toxicity-Mitomycin causes severe mydosuppression and is \ntoxic to the heart, liver, lung, and kidneys. CHAPTER 54 Cancer Chemotherapy 461 \nMISCELLANEOUS ANTICANCER AGENTS \nA. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors \nImati.nib is an example of a sdective anticancer drug whose \ndevdopment was guided by knowledge of a specific oncogene. It \ninhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the protein product of the \nbcr-abl oncogene that is commonly expressed in chronic mydog\u00ad\nenous leukemia (CML) associated with the Philaddphia chromo\u00ad\nsome translocation. In addition to its activity in CML, imatinib \nis effective for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors that \nexpress the c-kit tyrosine kinase, which is also inhibited. Resistance \nmay occur from mutation of the bcr-abl gene. Toxicity of imatinib \nincludes diarrhea, myalgia, fluid retention, and congestive heart \nfailure. Dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are newer anticancer \nkinase inhibitors. \nB. Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors \nTrastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, recognizes a surface pro\u00ad\ntein in breast cancer cells that overexpress the HER-2/neu recep\u00ad\ntor for epidermal growth factor. Acute toxicity of this antibody \nincludes nausea and vomiting, chills, fevers, and headache. Trastu\u00ad\nzumab may cause cardiac dysfunction, including heart failure. \nSeveral drugs inhibit an epidermal growth factor receptor \n(EGFR) that is distinct from the HER-2/neu receptor for the epi\u00ad\ndermal growth factor that is targeted by trastuzumab. The EGFR \nregulates signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, \ninvasion and metastasis, and angiogenesis. It is also implicated \nin inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of some anticancer drugs and \nradiation therapy. Cetmimab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody \ndirected to the extracellular domain of the EGFR. It is used in \ncombination with irinotecan and oxaliplatin for metastatic colon \ncancer and is used in combination with radiation for head and \nneck cancer. Its primary toxicity is skin rash and a hypersensitiv\u00ad\nity infusion reaction. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal \nantibody directed against the EGFR; it is approved for refractoty \nmetastatic colorectal cancer. Gdltinib and erlotinib are small \nmolecule inhibitors of the EGFR's tyrosine kinase domain. Both \nare used as second-line agents for non-small cdl lung cancer, and \nerlotinib is also used in combination therapy of advanced pancre\u00ad\natic cancer. Rash and diarrhea are the main toxicities. \nBevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to wa\u00ad\ncular endothelial growth &ctor (VEGF) and prevents it from \ninteracting with VEGF receptors. VEGF plays a critical role in \nthe angiogenesis required for tumor metastasis. Bevacizumab has \nactivity in colorectal, breast, non-small cd1 lung, and renal cancer. \nAdverse effects include hypertension, infusion reactions, arterial \nthrombosis, impaired wound healing, gastrointestinal perforation, \nproteinuria, and drug-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (DRONJ). \nZiv-aflibercept also interferes with VEGF function. It is a \nrecombinant fusion protein of the VEGF binding portions from \nthe extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, \nfused to the Fe portion of human IgG 1. \nSoiafcnib, sunitinib, and pampanib are small molecules that \ninhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including those \nassociated with the VEGF receptor family. They are metabolized by"

Hypertension, bleed\u00ad\ning complications, and fatigue are the most common adverse effi:cti;. \nC. Rituximab \nRitmimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a surface \nprotein (CD20) in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells and induces \ncomplement-mediated lysis, direct cytotoxicity, and induction of \napoptosis. It is currently used with conventional anticancer drugs \n(eg, cyclophosphamide plus vincristine plus prednisone) in low\u00ad\ngrade lymphomas. Rituximab is associated with hypersensitivity \nreactions and myelosuppression. \nD. Interferons \nThe interferons are endogenous glycoproteins with antineoplastic, \nimmunosuppressive, and antiviral actions. Alpha-interferons (see \nChapter 55) are effective against a number of neoplasms, includ\u00ad\ning hairy cell leukemia, the early stage of chronic myelogenous \nleukemia, and T-cell lymphomas. Toxic effects of the interferons \ninclude myelosuppression and neurologic dysfunction. \nE. Asparaginase \nAsparaginase is an enzyme that depletes serum asparagine; it is \nused in the treatment ofT-cell auxotrophic cancers (leukemia and \nlymphomas) that require exogenous asparagine for growth. Aspar\u00ad\naginase is given intravenously and may cause severe hypersensitiv\u00ad\nity reactions, acute pancreatitis, and bleeding. \nF. Proteasome Inhibitors \nBortezomib and car6lmmib are inhibitors of the chymotrypsin\u00ad\nlike activity of the 265 proteasome in mammalian cells. The 265 \nproteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated \nproteins, such as cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibition results in \ndown-regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) signaling \npathway. Adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy, thrombo\u00ad\ncytopenia, heart failure, and hypotension. It is currently used for \nthe treatment of multiple myeloma. \nSKILL KEEPER: MANAGEMENT OF \nANTICANCER DRUG HEMATOTOXICITY \n(SEE CHAPTER 33) \nBone marrow suppression is a characteristic toxicity of most \ncytotoxic anticancer drugs. What agents are available for the \ntreatment of anemia and neutropenia, and for platelet resto\u00ad\nration in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy? \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nHORMONAL ANTICANCER AGENTS \nA. Glucocorticoids \nPrednisone is the glucocorticoid most commonly used in cancer \nchemotherapy and is widely used in combination therapy for leu\u00ad\nkemias and lymphomas. Toxicity is described in Chapter 39. B. Gonadal Hormone Antagonists \nTammifm, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (see Chapter 40), \nblocks the binding of estrogen to receptors of estrogen-sensitive \ncancer cells in breast tissue. The drug is used in receptor-positive \nbreast carcinoma and has also been shown to have a preventive \neffect in women at high risk for breast cancer. Because it has ago\u00ad\nnist activity in the endometrium, tamoxifen increases the risk \nof endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia. Other adverse effi:cts \ninclude nausea and vomiting, hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, \nand venous thrombosis. Toremifene is a newer estrogen recep\u00ad\ntor antagonist used in advanced breast cancer. Flutamicle is an \nandrogen receptor antagonist used in prostatic carcinoma (see \nChapter 40). Adverse effi:cts include gynecomastia, hot flushes, \nand hepatic dysfunction. \nC. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Analogs \nLeuprolide, goserelin, and nafarelin are GnRH agonists, effec\u00ad\ntive in prostatic carcinoma. When administered in constant doses \nso as to maintain stable blood levels, they inhibit release of pitu\u00ad\nitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone \n(FSH). Leuprolide may cause bone pain, gynecomastia, hematu\u00ad\nria, impotence, and testicular atrophy (see Chapters 37 and 40). \nD. Aromatase Inhibitors \nAnastrozole and letrozole inhibit aromatase, the enzyme that \ncatalyzes the conversion of androstenedione (an androgenic pre\u00ad\ncursor) to estrone (an estrogenic hormone). Both drugs are used \nin advanced breast cancer. Toxicity includes nausea, diarrhea, hot \nflushes, bone and back pain, dyspnea, and peripheral edema. \nQUESTIONS \nQuestions 1-3. A 32-year-old woman underwent segmental \nmastectomy for a breast tumor of 3 cm diameter. Lymph node \nsampling revealed 2 involved nodes. Because chemotherapy is \nof established value in her situation, she underwent postopera\u00ad\ntive treatment with antineoplastic drugs. The regimen consisted \nof doxorubicin followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/ \nfluorouracil. Adjunctive drugs included tamoxifen because the \ntumor cells were hormone receptor-positive. \nI.

However, when dysreguJated, its powerful destructive \nmechanisms may do more harm than good. Examples include \nhypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune disorders, and rejection \nof transplanted tissues. Drugs that suppress immune mecha\u00ad\nnisms play an important role in treating these conditions. \nIncreasingly, monoclonal antibodies targeting proteins with key roles in immune responses are being developed as immunosup\u00ad\npressive agents. In some situations, drugs that potentiate the \nimmune response provide benefit. A growing number of other \nconditions now rely on monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics \n(cancer, cardiovascular conditions, HN, etc).

If the \ninnate response is inadequate, the adaptive immune response is \nmobilized. This culminates in activation of T lymphocytes, the \neffectors of cell-mediated immunity, and production of antibod\u00ad\nies by activated B lymphocytes, the effectors of hum.oral immu\u00ad\nnity. The subsets of lymphocytes that mediate different parts of \nthe immune response can be identified by specific cell surface \ncomponents or clusters of differentiation (CDs). For example, helper T (TH) cells bear the CD4 protein complex, whereas cyto\u00ad\ntoxic T lymphocytes express the CDS protein complex. \nB. Antigen Recognition and Processing \nThis critical inaugural step in the adaptive immune response \ninvolves llDtigen-presenting cells {APCs) such as dendritic \ncells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes, which process antigens \ninto small peptides recognized by T-cell receptors (TCRs) on \nthe surface of CD4 TH cells (Figure 55-1). The most important \nantigen-presenting cell surface molecules are the major histocom\u00ad\npatibility compla:: (MHC) classes I and II proteins, recognized \nby CDB and CD4 T cells, respectively.

A negative feed back inhibitor of T-cell activation \ncostimulatory and adhesion molecules in addition to activation of \nT-cell receptors. \nC. Cell-Mediated Immunity \nActivated TH cells secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine that ini\u00ad\ntiates proliferation and activation of two subsets of helper T cells, \nTHI and TH2 (Figure 55-1). THl cells orchestrate cell-mediated \nimmunity and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. They produce \ninterferon (IFN)-y, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor (lNF)-P (also \nknown as lymphotoxin). These cytokines activate macrophages, \nCD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and NK cells. Activated \nCTLs recognize processed peptides that are bound to class I MHC \nmolecules on the surface of virus-infected or tumor cells. The \nCTLs induce target cell death via lytic enzyme and nitric oxide \nproduction and by stimulation of apoptosis pathways in the target \ncells. CTLs also play a role in autoimmune diseases by reacting \nagainst normal tissues, such as the synovium in rheumatoid arthri\u00ad\ntis and myelin in multiple sclerosis. Activated NK cells kill both \nvirus-infected and neoplastic cells. \nD. Humoral Immunity \nThe B lymphoid cclJ., which are capable of differentiating into \nantibody-forming cells, mediate humoral immunity. The humoral \nresponse is triggered when B lymphocytes bind antigen via their \nsurface immunoglobulins. The antigens are internalized, processed \ninto peptides, bound to MHC class II molecules, and presented on \nthe B-cell surf.tee. When T-cell receptors on TH2 cells arc activated \nby the MHC II-peptide complex, they release interleukins (IL-4, \nIL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13). These cytokincs induce B-lymphocyte \nproliferation and differentiation into memory B cells and antibody\u00ad\nsccrcting plasma cells (Figure 55-1). Antibodies produced by plasma cells bind to antigens on the surface of pathogens and trig\u00ad\nger the precipitation of viruses and the destruction of bacteria by \nphagocytic cells or lysis by the complement system. \nThe proliferation and differentiation of both B and T lym\u00ad\nphocytes are under the control of a complex interplay between \nthe cytokines (Table 55-1) and other endogenous molecules, \nincluding lcukotricncs, and prostaglandins. For example, IL-10 \nand IFN-y downrcgulate THl and TH2 responses, respectively \n(Figure 55-1). \nE.Abnormal Immune Responses \nAbnormal immune responses include hypersensitivity, autoimmu\u00ad\nnity, and immunodeficiency states. Immediate hypersensitivity is \nusually antibody-mediated and includes anaphylaxis and hemo\u00ad\nlytic disease of the newborn. Delayed hypersensitivity, associated \nwith extensive tissue damage, is cell-mediated. Autoimmunity \narises from lymphocytes that react to one's own molecules, or \nself antigens. Examples of autoimmune diseases that arc amena\u00ad\nble to drug treatment include rheumatoid arthritis and systemic \nlupus erythcmatosus. Immunodeficiency states can be genetically \nacquired (eg, DiGcorge syndrome) or can result from cxtrinsic&c\u00ad\ntors (eg, HIV infection). \nIMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY \nThe primary immunosupprcssivc agents arc a diverse group of \ndrugs that range from the corticosteroid hormonal drugs (dis\u00ad\ncussed also in Chapter 39) to antimetabolitc anticancer drugs (dis\u00ad\ncussed also in Chapter 54) to drugs that more selectively target \ncells of the immune system. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Toxicity-Predictable adverse effects include adrenal suppres\u00ad\nsion, growth inhibition, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, salt reten\u00ad\ntion, glucose intolerance, and behavioral changes (see Chapter 39). \nB. Calcfneurln and mTOR Inhibitors \n1. Mechanism of action-These immunosuppressants inter\u00ad\nfere with T-cell function by binding to immunophilins, small \ncytoplasmic proteins that play critical roles in T-cdl responses to \nT-cell receptor activation and to cytokines. Cydosporine binds to \ncyclophilin and tacrolimua binds to FK-binding protein (FKBP). \nBoth complexes inhibit calcineurin, a cytoplasmic phosphatase. \nCalcineurin regulates the ability of the nuclear factor of activated \nT cells (NF-AT) to translocate to the nucleus and increase the pro\u00ad\nduction of key cytokines such as IL-2, IL-3, and IFN-y. Cyclospo\u00ad\nrine and tacrolimus prevent the increased production of cytokines \nthat normally occurs in response to T-cell receptor activation . \nSirolimw and its analogs (everolimus, temsirolimus) also bind \nto FK-binding protein 12. Instead of inhibiting calcineurin, these \ndrug-protein complexes inhibit the kinase activity of mammalian \ntarget of rapamycin (m TOR), a key regulator of a complex intracel\u00ad\nlular signaling pathway involved in cell growth and proliferation, \nangiogenesis, and metabolism. By inhibiting the mTOR pathway, \nsirolimus inhibits the T-cdl proliferation response to IL-2. \n2. Clinical uses and phannacolclnetlcs-Use of these immu\u00ad\nnosuppressants is a major factor in the success of transplantation. \nThey are used in solid organ transplantation and to prevent and treat graft-versus-host (GVH) disease in recipients of allogeneic \nstem cell transplantation. These agents, particularly cyclosporine \nand tacrolimus, are also used in some autoimmune diseases, includ\u00ad\ning rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, psoriasis, asthma, and type 1 \ndiabetes. Sirolimus-duting stents are used to prevent restenosis \nafter coronary angioplasty. Like sirolimus, everolimus is used as an \nimmunosuppressant. Everolimus and temsirolimus are also used \nfor various cancers. \nCyclosporine and tacrolimus are available as oral or intravenous \nagents, whereas sirolimus and everolimus are available only as oral \ndrugs. Temsirolimus is available as an intravenous agent. Because \ncyclosporine exhibits erratic bioavailability, serum levels are rou\u00ad\ntindy monitored. The drug undergoes slow hepatic metabolism by \nthe cytochrome P450 system and has a long half-life. Its metabo\u00ad\nlism is affected by a host of other drugs, requiring careful consid\u00ad\neration of drug-drug interactions. \n3. Toxicity-Cyclosporine and tacrolimus have similar toxicity \nprofiles. The most common adverse effects are renal dysfunc\u00ad\ntion, hypertension, and neurotoxicity. These drugs can also cause \nhyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis. Sirolimus and \nits analogs are more likdy than the other agents to cause hyper\u00ad\ntriglyceridemia, hepatotox.icity, diarrhea, and myelosuppression. \nC. Mycophenolate Mofetil \n1. Mechanism of action-This drug is rapidly converted into \nmycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine monophosphate dehy\u00ad\ndrogenase, an enzyme in the de novo pathway of guanosine tri\u00ad\nphosphate (GTP) synthesis. This action suppresses both B-and \nT-lymphocyte activation. Lymphocytes are panicularly susceptible \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Mechanism of action-Two types of antis era directed against \nlymphocytes are available. Antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and \nantithymocyte globulin (ATG) are produced in horses, sheep, or \nrabbits by immunization against human lymphoid cells. Antibod\u00ad\nies in these preparations bind to human T cells involved in antigen \nrecognition and initiate their destruction by serum complement. \nThese antibodies selectively block cellular immunity rather than \nantibody formation, which accounts for their ability to suppress \norgan graft rejection, a cell-mediated process. \n2. Clinical use-ALG and ATG are used before allogeneic stem \ncell transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host reaction. They are \nalso used in combination with other immunosuppressants for solid \norgan transplantation. \n3. Toxicity-Because humoral immunity may remain intact, \ninjection of ALG or ATG can cause hypersensitivity reactions, \nincluding serum sickness and anaphylaxis. Pain and erythema \noccur at injection sites, and lymphoma has been noted as a late \ncomplication. \nB. Immune Globulin Intravenous \n1.

Clinical use-Rho(D) immune globulin is used for prevention \nof Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn. In women treated with \nRho(D) immune globulin 24-72 h after delivery, maternal anti\u00ad\nbodies to Rh-positive cells are not produced in subsequent preg\u00ad\nnancies, and hemolytic disease of the neonate is averted. \nD. Monoclonal Antibodies \nMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have the advantage of high speci\u00ad\nficity because they can be developed for interaction with a single \nmolecule. \"Humanization\" of murine monoclonal antibodies and \nwholly human monoclonal antibodies (based on genetic engineer\u00ad\ning of transgenic mice that make human antibodies, Figure SS-2) \nhave reduced, but not completely eliminated, the likelihood of for\u00ad\nmation of neutralizing antibodies and of immune reactions. Three \nAdalimumab lnfliximab \nCH2 CH2 \nFe region of \nhuman lgG1 \nCH3 CH3 types of MAbs used as immunosuppressive agents are described in \nthe text that follows, and characteristics of some other therapeutic \nMAbs, including some used for nonimmunologic purposes, are \nlisted in Table SS-3. \n1. TargetTNF:lnflbdmab-This chimericMAb (Figure 55-2) is \ntargeted against TNF-a, a proinflammatory cytokine, and thereby \ndecreases formation of interleukins and adhesion molecules \ninvolved in leukocyte activation. Infliximab induces remissions in \ntreatment-resistant Crohn disease. In combination with metho\u00ad\ntrexate, infliximab improves symptoms in patients with rheu\u00ad\nmatoid arthritis. It also is effective in the treatment of ulcerative \ncolitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Infusion reac\u00ad\ntions and an increased rate of infection may occur. Adalimumab \n(Figure SS-2) is a completely human IgG monoclonal antibody \nthat binds to TNF-a and is approved for treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis. Though not a true MAb, etanercept (Figure 55-2) is an \nimmunoglobulin-based agent that also binds with high affinity \nand thereby sequesters TNF-a. It is a dimer of identical chains \nof a human TNF receptor fused to a human IgG constant region. \nEtanercept is used in arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondy\u00ad\nlitis, and it is being investigated in other inflammatory diseases. \nInjection site reactions and hypersensitivity may occur. Certoli\u00ad\nzumab and golimumab arc two newer anti-TNF agents. All of the \nanti-TNF-a agents increase the risk of serious infection, reactiva\u00ad\ntion of tuberculosis, and lymphoma. \n2. Target IL-2: Doclizumob-Daclizumab is a highly specific \nMAb that binds to the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor dis\u00ad\nplayed on the surface of T cells and prevents activation by IL-2 \n(Figure 55-3). It was used in combination with other immuno\u00ad\nsuppressants to prevent renal transplant rejection. In contrast \nto cyclosporinc, tacrolimus, or cytotoxic immunosuppressants, \nthe adverse effects of daclizumab are serious inflammatory brain \nEtanercept \nExtracellular domain \nof human p75 receptor \nCH2 Fe region of \nhuman lgG1 \nCH3 \nFIGURE 55-2 Structures of immunoglobulin-based TNF-a. antagonists.

Cytokine Inhibitors \nAn important application of immunomodulation therapy involves \nthe use of cytokine inhibitors for inflammatory diseases (see \nChapter 36). Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally \noccurring IL-1 receptor antagonist that prevents IL-1 from binding \nto its receptor. Canakinumab is a recombinant human anti-IL-1 p \nmonoclonal antibody. It binds to human IL-lP and prevents it from binding to IL-1 receptors.

Type I (Immediate) Drug Allergy \nThis form of drug allergy involves lgE-mediated reactions to ani\u00ad\nmal and plant stings and pollens as well as to drugs. Such reactions \ninclude anaphylaxis, urticaria, and angioedema. When linked to \ncarrier proteins, small drug molecules can act as haptens and initi\u00ad\nate B-cell proliferation and formation of lgE antibodies. These \nantibodies bind to Fe receptors on tissue mast cells and blood \nbasophils. On subsequent exposure, the antigenic drug cross-links \nthe lgE antibodies on the surface of mast cdls and basophils and \ntriggers rdease of mediators of vascular responses and tissue injury, \nincluding histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. \nDrugs that commonly cause type I reactions include penicillins \nand sulfonamides. \nSKILL KEEPER: ANAPHYLAXIS AND \nSYMPATHOMIMETIC DRUGS (SEE \nCHAPTERS 6 AND 9) \nIn severe anaphylactic reactions, the life-threatening events \ncommonly involve airway obstruction, laryngeal edema, and \nvascular collapse resulting from peripheral vasodilation and \nreduction in blood volume. Hypoxemia can contribute to \ncardiac events, including arrhythmias and myocardial infarc\u00ad\ntion. Drugs used to treat anaphylaxis mainly target the recep\u00ad\ntors used by neurotransmitters of the sympathetic nervous \nsystem. \n1. Why is epinephrine rather than norepinephrine used in \nanaphylaxis? \n2. What other sympathomimetic drugs might be useful in the \ntreatment of anaphylaxis? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. \nB. Type II Drug Allergy \nType II allergy involves IgG or lgM antibodies that are bound to \ncirculating blood cells. On re-exposure to the antigen, comple\u00ad\nment-dependent cdl lysis occurs. Type II reactions include auto\u00ad\nimmune syndromes such as hemolytic anemia from methyldopa, \nsystemic lupus erythematosus from hydralazine or procainamide, \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Drug-induced serum sickness and vascu\u00ad\nlitis arc examples of type III reactions; Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n(associated with sulfonamide therapy) may also result from type III \nmechanisms. \nD. Type IV Drug Allergy \nType N allergy is a cell-mediated reaction that can occur from \ntopical application of drugs. It results in contact dermatitis. \nE. Modification of Drug Allergies \nDrugs that modify allergic responses to other drugs or toxins act \nat several steps of the immune mechanism. For example, corti\u00ad\ncosteroids inhibit lymphoid cell proliferation and reduce tissue \ninjury and edema. However, most drugs that arc useful in type \nI reactions (eg, epinephrine, H1 antagonists, corticosteroids) \nblock mediator rdease or act as physiologic antagonists of the \nmediators. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

If an injection ofRho(D) antibody is administered to \nthe Rh-negative mother within 24-72 h after the birth of an \nRh-positive infant, the mother's own antibody response to the \nforeign Rh0(D)-positive cells is suppressed because the infant's \nred cells are cleared from circulation before the mother can \ngenerate a B-cell response against Rh0(D). Therefore, she has \nno memory B cells that can activate upon subsequent preg\u00ad\nnancies with an Rh0(D)-positive fetus. The answer is D. \n4. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to \nTNF-a. Etanercept also binds to TNF-a, but it is a chimeric \nprotein containing a portion of the human TNF-cx receptor \nlinked to the Fe region of a human IgG.

CO \nis slightly lighter than air hut mixes homogeneously in room air. \nf. Effects-CO causes tissue hypoxia. Headache occurs first, \nfollowed by confusion, decreased visual acuity, tachycardia, syn\u00ad\ncope, coma, seizures, and death. Collapse and syncope occur when \napproximately 40% of hemoglobin has been converted to carboxy\u00ad\nhemoglobin. Prolonged hypoxia can result in irreversible damage \nto the brain and the myocardium. Exposure of a pregnant woman \nto elevated CO levels at critical fetal devdopmental periods may \ncause fetal death or serious and irreversible but survivable birth \ndefects. \n2. Treatment-Removal of the source of CO and 100% oxygen \nare the main features of treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen accelerates \nthe clearance of CO. \nC. Sulfur Dioxide \nSulfur dioxide (SO:z) is a colorless, irritating gas formed &om the \ncombustion of fossil fuels. \nf. Effects-S02 forms sulfurous acid on contact with moist \nmucous membranes; this acid is responsible for most of the patho\u00ad\nlogic effects. Conjunctival and bronchial irritation (especially in \nindividuals with asthma) is the primary sign of exposure. Presence \nof 5-10 ppm in the air is enough to cause severe bronchospasm. \nHeavy exposure may lead to delayed pulmonary edema. Chronic \nlow-level exposure may aggravate cardiopulmonary disease. \n2. Treatment-Removal from exposure to S02 and relief of irri\u00ad\ntation and inflammation constitute the major treatment. D. Nitrogen Oxides \nNitrogen dioxide (N02), a brownish irritant heavier-than-air gas, \nis the principal member of this group. It is formed in fires and in \nsilage on fums. \n1. Effects-N0 2 causes deep lung irritation and pulmonary \nedema. Farm workers exposed to high concentrations of the gas \nwithin enclosed silos may die rapidly of acute pulmonary edema. \nIrritation of the eyes, nose, and throat is common. Today, the \nmost common source of human exposure to oxides of nitrogen, \nincluding N02, is automobile and truck traffic emissions. \n2. Treatment-No specific treatment is available. Measures to \nreduce inflammation and pulmonary edema are important. \nE.Ozone \nOzone (03) is a bluish irritant gas produced in air and water puri\u00ad\nfication devices and in electrical fields.

            "Text": "A. Halogenated Aliphatic Hydrocarbons \nThis group includes halogenated solvents such as carbon tetrachlo\u00ad\nride, chloroform, and trichloroethylene. \n1. Effects-Solvents are potent CNS depressants. The acute \neffects of excessive exposure are nausea, vertigo, locomotor distur\u00ad\nbances, headache, and coma. Chronic exposure leads to hepatic \ndysfunction and nephrotoxicity. Long-term exposure to tctrachlo\u00ad\nroethylene or to trichloroethane has caused peripheral neuropathy. \n2. Treatment-Removal from exposure is the only specific treat\u00ad\nment available. Serious CNS depression must be treated with sup\u00ad\nport of vital signs (sec Chapter 58). \nB. Aromatic Hydrocarbons \nBenzene, toluene, and xylene are important aromatic hydrocarbons. \n1. Effects-Acute exposure to any of these hydrocarbons leads \nto CNS depression with ataxia and coma. Long-term exposure \nto benzene is associated with hematotoxicity (thrombocytopenia, \naplastic anemia, pancytopenia) and various types of hematologic \ncancers, especially leukemia. Most national and international \norganizations classify benzene as a known human carcinogen. \nToluene (methylbcnzenc) and xylene (dimethylbenzcnc) are not \ncarcinogenic. \n2. Treatment-Removal from exposure is the only specific way to \nreduce toxicity. CNS depression is managed by support of vital signs. \nSKILL KEEPER: SAFETY OF NEW DRUGS \n(SEE CHAPTER 1) \nThe FDA requires evidence of the relative safety of a new drug \nbefore its dinical evaluation. If a new drug is destined for \nchronic systemic administration, what animal toxicity testing \nis required? \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nPESTICIDES \nA. Classification and Prototypes \nThe three major classes of pesticides are chlorinated hydrocarbons \n(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT] and its analogs), ace\u00ad\ntylcholinesterase inhibitors (carbamates, organophosphates}, and \nbotanical agents (nicotine, rotenonc, pyrethrum alkaloids). \nB. Chlorinated Hydrocarbons \nThese agents are persistent, poorly metabolized, lipophilic chemi\u00ad\ncals that exhibit significant bioaccumulation. \n1. Effects-Chlorinated hydrocarbons block physiologic inac\u00ad\ntivation in the sodium channels of nerve membranes and cause CHAPTER 56 Environmental & Occupational Toxicology 483 \nuncontrolled firing of action potentials. Tremor is usually the first \nsign of acute toxicity and may progress to seizures. Chronic exposure \nof animals to these pesticides is tumorigenic. The toxicologic impact \nof long-term exposure in humans is unclear. Although no relation\u00ad\nship has been shown in humans between the risk of breast cancer \nand serum levds of DDT metabolites, recent evidence suggests an \nassociation with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer. \n2. Treatment-No specific treatment is available fur the acute \ntoxicity caused by chlorinated hydrocarbons. Because of their \nextremdy long half-lives in organisms and in the environment \n(years), their use in North America and Europe has been curtailed. \nC. Cholinesterase Inhibitors \nThe carbamates (eg, aldicarb, carbaryl) and organophosphates \n(cg, dichlorvos, malathion, parathion) are effective pesticides with \nshon environmental half-lives. These inexpensive drugs are heavily \nused in agriculture. \nJ. Effects-As described in Chapter 7, cholinesterase inhibi\u00ad\ntors increase muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic activity. The \nsigns and symptoms include pinpoint pupils, sweating, salivation, \nbronchoconstriction, vomiting and diarrhea, CNS stimulation \nfollowed by depression, and muscle fasciculations, weakness, and \nparalysis. The most common cause of death is respiratory failure. \n2. Treatment-Atropine is used in large doses to control mus\u00ad\ncarinic excess; pralidoximc is used to regenerate cholinesterase (see \nChapter 8). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary until suf\u00ad\nficient cholinesterase has been regenerated. \nD. Botanical lnsedicides \n1. Nicotine and nicotinoids-Nicotinc and nicotinoids have \nthe same effects on nicotinic cholinoceptors in insects as in mam\u00ad\nmals and probably kills by the same mechanism (ie, excitation \nfollowed by paralysis of ganglionic, CNS, and neuromuscular \ntransmission). Treatment is supportive. \n2. Rotenone- This plant alkaloid pesticide causes gastrointesti\u00ad\nnal distress when ingested and conjunctivitis and dermatitis after \ndirect contact with exposed body surfaces. Treatment is supportive. \n3. Pyrethrum-The most common toxic effect of this mixture \nof plant alkaloids is contact dermatitis. Ingestion or inhalation of \nlarge quantities may cause CNS excitation (including seizures) and \nperipheral neurotoxicity. Treatment is supportive with anticon\u00ad\nvulsants if necessary. \nHERBICIDES \nA. Chlorophenoxy Acids \nThe two most important members of this group are 2,4-\ndichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, \nthe compound in Agent Orange. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic"

Large doses of these drugs cause muscle hypotonia and \ncoma. Long-term exposure has been associated with an increased \nrisk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \nB. Glyphosate \nGlyphosate is the principal ingredient in Roundup brand weed \nkiller and is now the most widely used herbicide in the world. \nIts target, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, is a key \nenzyme involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in plants. \nf. Effects-Glyphosate exposure causes significant eye and skin \nirritation and can be fatal when ingested in large quantities. \n2. Treatment-Supportive, no specific treatment is available. \nC.Paraquat \nParaquat, a bipyridyl herbicide, is used extensively to kill weeds on \nfarms and for highway maintenance. \nf. Effects- The compound is relatively nontoxic unless ingested. \nAfter ingestion, the initial effect is gastrointestinal irritation with \nhematemesis and bloody stools. Within a few days, signs of pul\u00ad\nmonary impairment occur and arc usually progressive, resulting in \nsevere pulmonary fibrosis and often death. \n2. Treatment-No specific antidote is available. Because of the \ndelayed pulmonary toxicity, prompt prevention of absorption is \nimportant (activated charcoal, Fuller's earth). Gastric lavage is \nnot recommended, as it may promote aspiration from the stom\u00ad\nach into the lungs. Once the paraquat is absorbed, treatment is \nsuccessful in fewer than 50% of cases. Pulmonary fibrosis starts \n1-2 weeks after ingestion. lmmunosuppression with corticoste\u00ad\nroids and cyclophosphamide are commonly used. Antioxidants \nsuch as acetylcysteine and salicylate might be beneficial through \nfree radical-scavenging, anti-inflammatory actions. However, the \nbest supportive treatment, including dialysis, still results in less \nthan 50% survival after ingestion of as little as 50-500 mg/kg. \nENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS \nChemical compounds that contribute to environmental pollution \ninclude the polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, asbestos, and the \nheavy metals discussed in Chapter 57. \nA. Polychlorlnated Blphenyls \nf. Source- The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used \nextensively in manufacturing electrical equipment until their \npotential for environmental damage was recognized. PCBs are \namong the most stable organic compounds known. They are \npoorly metabolized and lipophilic. They are therefore highly per\u00ad\nsistent in the environment, and they accumulate in the food chain. \nDue to their estrogen-like effects, PCBs are endocrine disruptors. 2. Effects-In workers exposed to PCBs, the most common effect \nis dermatotoxicity (acne, erythema, folliculitis, hyperkeratosis). \nLess frequently, mild increases in plasma triglycerides and elevated \nliver enzymes have been observed. Food is the major source of \nPCBs in humans. Epidemiologic studies have established a cor\u00ad\nrelation with increases in various cancers. \nB. Dioxins \n1. Source-The polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins) are \na large group of related compounds of which the most important \nis 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The dioxins \nhave appeared in the environment as unwanted byproducts of the \nchemical industry. They arc chemically stable and highly resistant \nto environmental degradation. \n2. Effects-In laboratory animals, exposure to TCDD causes a \nwasting syndrome, hepatotoxicity, immune dysfunction, teratoge\u00ad\nnicity, and cancer. In humans, the most common signs of toxicity \nare dermatitis and chloracne, which are cystic acneiform lesions \nthat typically form on the face and upper body. Epidemiologic \nevidence suggests that the dioxins also have carcinogenic and tera\u00ad\ntogenic effects in humans. \nC.Asbestos \n1. Source-Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring long, flex\u00ad\nible mineral fibers, most commonly containing silicon. Asbestos \nhas been used widely in manufacturing and building. Because it \nis poorly metabolized and lipophilic , it is highly persistent in the \nenvironment and accumulates in the food chain. Many countries \nhave banned all use of asbestos because of its toxicity and strictly \nregulate handling of preexisting asbestos building products. \n2. Effects-Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause a fibrotic lung \ndisorder called asbestosis, which is characterized by shortness of \nbreath. Asbestos is also associated with several cancers including \nlung cancer, mesothelioma , and cancers of the gastrointestinal \ntract. \nMETALS \nOccupational and environmental poisoning with metals is a major \nhealth problem. The classic metal poisons (arsenic, lead, and mer\u00ad\ncury) are discussed in Chapter 57. Occupational exposure and poi\u00ad\nsoning due to beryllium, cadmium, manganese, and uranium \nare relatively new occupational problems. Cobalt and cobalt\u00ad\nreleasing compounds are anticipated to be carcinogens. \nBeryllium is highly toxic by inhalation and causes acute and \nchronic disease characterized by pulmonary fibrosis. The metal can \nbe found in computers and heat shields in space vehicles. No anti\u00ad\ndote is available. Cadmium is used in many industrial processes. It \nis toxic by inhalation and ingestion. Heating cadmium-containing \nmetal can release cadmium dust, which causes cadmium fume \nfever, fever chills and malaise. Chronic exposure can cause pulmo\u00ad\nnary fibrosis. No antidote is available. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

The tox\u00ad\nicity profiles of metals differ, but most of their effects appear to \nresult from interaction with essential cations, sulthydryl groups \nof enzymes, and regulatory proteins. Chelators are organic C H A P T E R \ncompounds with two or more dectronegative groups that form \nstable bonds with cationic metal atoms. These stable complexes \nlack the toxicity of the free metals and often are excreted read\u00ad\nily.

Lead is a major \nenvironmental hazard because it is present in the air and water \nthroughout the world. \n7. Acute lead poisoning-Because of the ban on lead over \n20 years ago in gasoline, and because of bans on other industrial \nproducts that previously contained lead, acute inorganic lead poi\u00ad\nsoning is no longer common in the United States. It can occur \nrardy from industrial exposures (usually via the inhalation of dust) \nand in children who have ingested large quantities of chips or Succimer \nPenlclllamine \nDeferoxamine, \ndeferasirox \nL EDTA \nflakes from surfaces in older houses covered with lead-containing \npaint.

Succimer \nis generally used in such children. Similarly, studies suggest that \nlead may accentuate an age-related decline in cognitive function \nin older adults. In workers exposed to lead, prophylaxis with oral \nchelating agents is contraindicated because some evidence suggests \nthat lead absorption may be enhanced by the presence of chelators. \nIn contrast, high dietary calcium is indicated because it impedes \nlead absorption. \n3. Organic lead poisoning-Now rare, poisoning by organic \nlead was usually due to tetraethyl lead or tetramethyl lead con\u00ad\ntained in \"antiknock\" gasoline additives, which are no longer used. \nThis form of lead is readily absorbed through the skin and lungs. \nThe primary signs of intoxication include hallucinations, head\u00ad\nache, irritability, convulsions, and coma.

A sweet, garlicky \nodor may be detected in the breath and the stools. Treatment con\u00ad\nsists of supponive therapy to replace water and electrolytes, and \nchelation therapy with dimercaprol. \n2.

Acute mercury poisoning-Acute mercury poisoning usually \noccurs through inhalation of inorganic demental mercury. It causes \nchest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, kidney damage, \ngastroenteritis, and CNS damage. In addition to intensive support\u00ad\nive care, prompt chelation with oral succimer or with intramuscular \ndimercaprol is essential. Acute ingestion of mercuric chloride causes \na severe, life-threatening hemorrhagic gastroenteritis followed within \nhours to days by acute tubular necrosis and oliguric renal failure. \n2. Chronic mercury poisoning-Chronic mercury poisoning \nmay occur with inorganic or organic mercury. Poisoning from \ninhalation of mercury vapor presents as a diffuse set of symptoms \ninvolving the gums and teeth, gastrointestinal disturbances, and \nneurologic and behavioral changes (erethism). Chronic mercury \nintoxication has been treated with succimer and unithiol, but their \nefficacy has not been established. Dimercaprol may redistribute \nmercury to the CNS and should not be used in chronic exposure \nto demental mercury. \n3. Organic mercury poisoning-Intoxication with organic \nmercury compounds was first recognized in connection with \nan epidemic of neurologic and psychiatric disease in the village \nof Minamata, Japan, which was first noticed in the 1950s. The \noutbreak was a result of consumption of fish containing a high \ncontent of methylmercury, which was produced by bacteria in \nseawater from mercury in the effluent of a nearby vinyl plastics\u00ad\nmanufacturing plant. Similar epidemics have resulted from the \nconsumption of grain that was intended for use as seed and treated \nwith fungicidal organic mercury compounds. Treatment with che\u00ad\nlators has been tried, but the benefits are uncertain. \nD.lron \nAcute poisoning from the ingestion of ferrous sulfate tablets occurs \nfrequently in small children, although the incidence of poisonings \ndropped dramatically in the United States after iron supplements \nwere required to be packed in unit-dose packaging. The initial \nsymptoms of iron poisoning include vomiting, gastrointestinal \nbleeding, lethargy, and gray cyanosis. These can be followed by \nsigns of severe gastrointestinal necrosis, pneumonitis, jaundice, \nseizures, and coma. Deferoxamine is the chelating agent of choice. \nChronic excessive intake of iron can lead to hemosiderosis or \nhemochromatosis (see Chapter 33). \nSKILL KEEPER: IRON DEFICIENCY \n(SEE CHAPTER 33) \nIron is the essential meta/Ile element of heme, the molecule \nresponsible for the bulk of oxygen transport in the blood. \n1, How is the iron content of the body regulated? \n2. How is the iron defidency diagnosed and treated? \nThe Skill Keeper Answers appear at the end of the chapter. CHAPTER 57 Heavy Metals & Chelators 489 \nCHELATORS \nChelators used clinically include dimercaprol (BAL [British anti\u00ad\nlewisite]), succimer, unithiol, penicillamine, edetate (EDTA), \ndeferoxamine, and deferasirox. Variations among these agents in \ntheir affinities for specific metals govern their clinical applications \n(Table 57-1). \nA. Dimercaprol \nDimercaprol (2,3-dimercaptopropanol; BAL) is a bidentate che\u00ad\nlator; that is, a chelator that forms 2 bonds with the metal ion, \npreventing the metal's binding to tissue proteins and permitting \nits rapid excretion. \n1. Clinical use-Dimercaprol is used in acute arsenic and mer\u00ad\ncury poisoning and, in combination with EDT A, for lead poison\u00ad\ning. It is an oily liquid that must be given parenterally. \n2. Toxicity-Dimercaprol causes a high incidence of adverse \neffects, possibly because it is highly lipophilic and readily enters \ncells. Its toxicity includes transient hypertension, tachycardia, \nheadache, nausea and vomiting, paresthesias, and fever (especially \nin children). It may cause pain and hernatomas at the injection \nsite. Long-term use is associated with thrombocytopenia and \nincreased prothrombin time. \nB. Succimer \nSuccimer (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA) is a water-soluble \nbidentate congener of dimercaprol. \n1. Clinical use-Succimer is used for the oral treatment of lead \ntoxicity in children and adults. It is as effective as parenteral EDT A \nin reducing blood lead concentration. Succimer is also effective \nin arsenic and mercury poisoning, if given within a few hours of \nexposure. \n2. Toxicity-Although succimer appears to be less toxic than \ndimercaprol, gastrointestinal distress, CNS effects, skin rash, and \ndevation of liver enzymes may occur. \nC. Unithiol \nA water-soluble derivative of dimercaprol, unithiol can be admin\u00ad\nistered orally or intravenously. \n1. Clinical use-Intravenous unithiol is used in the initial treat\u00ad\nment of severe acute poisoning by inorganic mercury or arsenic. \nOral unithiol is an alternative to succimer in the treatment of lead \nintoxication. \n2. Toxlclty-Unithiol causes a low incidence of dermatological \nreactions, usually mild. V asodilation and hypotension may occur \nwith rapid intravenous infusion. \nD. Penicillamine \nPenicillamine, a derivative of penicillin, is another bidentate \nchelator."

It is sometimes used \nas adjunctive therapy in gold, arsenic, and lead intoxication and \nin rheumatoid arthritis. The agent is water-soluble, well absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract, and excreted unchanged. \n2.

Ethylenedlamlnetetraacetlc Acid \nEDTA (edetate) is an efficient polydentate chelator of many diva\u00ad\nlent cations, including calcium, and trivalent cations. \nf. Cllnlcal use-The primary use of EDT A is in the treatment \nof lead poisoning. Because the agent is highly polar, it is given \nparenterally. To prevent dangerous hypocalcemia, EDT A is given \nas the calcium disodium salt. \n2. Toxicity-The most important adverse effect of the agent is \nncphrotoxicity, including renal tubular necrosis. This risk can \nbe reduced by adequate hydration and restricting treatment with \nEDT A to 5 days or less. Elcctrocardiographic changes can occur \nat high doses. \nF. Deferoxamine, Deferasirox,. and Deferiprone \nDcferoxaminc is a polydcntatc bacterial product with an extremely \nhigh and selective affinity for iron and a much lower affinity for \naluminum. Fortunately, the drug competes poorly for heme iron \nin hemoglobin and cytochromcs. Dcfcrasirox is a newer tridentate \nchelator with selectively high affinity for iron. Dcfcriprone is a \nbidentate chelator, primarily cleared by the kidney, and effective \nat lowering cardiac iron. \nf. Clinical use-Defcroxamine is used parenterally in the treat\u00ad\nment of acute iron intoxication and in the treatment of iron over\u00ad\nload caused by blood transfusions in patients with diseases such as \nthalassemia or myclodysplastic syndrome (see Chapter 33). Defcr\u00ad\nasirox is an oral drug approved for treatment of iron overload. \n2. Toxicity-Skin reactions (blushing, erythema, urticaria) may \noccur. With long-term use, neurotoxicity (eg, retinal degenera\u00ad\ntion), hepatic and renal dysfunction, and severe coagulopathies \nhave been reported. Rapid intravenous administration of deferox\u00ad\namine can cause histamine release and hypotensive shock. Defcri\u00ad\nprone can cause neutropenia and agranulocytosis. \nG. Prussian Blue \nPrussian blue is a hydrated crystalline compound in which Fe2\n\u2022 \nand Fe3+ atoms are coordinated with cyanide groups in a cubic \nlattice structure. Prussian blue is approved for the treatment of contamination with radioactive cesium (137 Cs) and intoxication \nwith thallium salts. \nQUESTIONS \nI.

Of the drugs listed, intravenous EDTA is the most \neffective chelating agent. Oral succimer is used in children \nwith mild to moderate lead poisoning and may be initiated \n4-5 d after the parenteral use of EDTA or dimercaprol in \nsevere poisoning. The answer is C. CHAPTER 57 Heavy Metals & Chelators 491 \n2. The \"milk and roses\" complexion, which results from vaso\u00ad\ndilation and anemia, is a characteristic of chronic inorganic \narsenic poisoning, whereas patients with lead poisoning often \nhave a gray pallor. Other signs and symptoms of arsenic poi\u00ad\nsoning include gastrointestinal distress, hyperpigmentation, \nand white lines on the nails. We hope you were not led astray \nby her employment. The answer is B. \n3. Of the agents listed, lead is most likely to cause a decrease in \nheme biosynthesis. The urinary concentrations of lead before \nand after EDTA treatment can confirm the diagnosis. The \nanswer is C. \n4. The treatment of choice in acute arsenic poisoning is intra\u00ad\nmuscular dimercaprol. Although succimer is less toxic, it is \nonly available in an oral formulation, and its absorption may \nbe impaired by the severe gastroenteritis that occurs in acute \narsenic poisoning. The answer is B. \nS. From the signs and symptoms alone, a diagnosis of arsine gas \npoisoning cannot be made. However, clues to the cause of \npoisoning are often provided by a patient's occupation. The \nlaboratory reports suggest marked hemolysis. Arsine gas binds \nto hemoglobin and decreases erythrocyte glutathione levels, \ncausing membrane fragility and resulting hemolysis. The \nanswer is A. \n6. This question emphasizes that the ingestion of iron tablets is \na relatively common cause of accidental poisoning in young \nchildren. The signs and symptoms described usually occur in \nthe first 6 h after ingestion. In a child whose body weight is \n22 lb, the ingestion of 600 mg can cause severe, perhaps \nlethal, toxicity.

Autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and \nhemolytic anemia have occurred during the treatment of \nWilson disease with penicillamine. The answer is I. \n9. Deferoxamine can cause shock if given by rapid intravenous \ninfusion. The answer is B. \n10. Oral and gastrointestinal complaints are common in chronic \nmercury poisoning, and tremor involving the fingers and \narms is often present. The answer is E. \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWERS: IRON DEFICIENCY \n(SEE CHAPTER 33) \n1. Regulation of total body iron occurs through a tightly \nregulated system of intestinal absorption. Iron is absorbed \nand either stored in mucosa/ cells as ferritin or transported \ninto blood and distributed throughout the body bound to \ntransferrin. Most of the iron in the body is present in hemo\u00ad\nglobin. Small quantities of iron are eliminated in sweat, \nsaliva, and the exfo/iation of skin and mucosa/ cells. \n2. Iron deficiency can be diagnosed from red blood cell \nchanges, Including microcytic size and decreased hemo\u00ad\nglobin content. and from measurement of serum and \nbone marrow iron stores.

            "Text": "Managetnent of the \nPoisoned Patient \nOver one million cases of acute poisoning occur in the USA each \nyear, although only a small number are fatal. Most deaths are due \nto intentional suicidal overdose. Toxic substances include thera\u00ad\npeutic agents as well as agricultural and industrial chemicals that \nhave no medical appllcations. Most chemicals are capable of caus\u00ad\ning toxic effects when given in excessive dosage; even for thera\u00ad\npeutic drugs, the difference between a therapeutic action and a \ntoxic one is most often a matter of dose. Many toxic effects of \ntherapeutic agents have been discussed in previous chapters. Com\u00ad\nmon toxic syndromes associated with major drug groups are sum\u00ad\nmarized in this chapter. This chapter also reviews the principles of \nmanagement of the poisoned patient. \nTOXICOKINETICS, TOXICODYNAMICS, \n& CAUSE OF DEATH \nA. Tox:lcoklnetlcs \nThis term denotes the disposition of poisons in the body (ie, their \npharmacokinctics). Knowledge of a toxin's absorption, distribu\u00ad\ntion, and elimination permits assessment of the value of proce\u00ad\ndures designed to remove it from the skin or gastrointestinal tract. \nFor example, drugs with large apparent volumes of distribution, \nsuch as antidepressants and antimalarials, are not amenable to \ndialysis procedures for drug removal. Drugs with low volumes \nof distribution, including lithium, phenytoin, and salicylates, are \nmore readily removed by dialysis and diuresis procedures. In some \ncases, renal elimination of weak acids can be accelerated by uri\u00ad\nnary alkalinization, whereas renal elimination of some weak bases \ncan be accelerated by urinary acidification. Acidification of urine \ncan be achieved by NH1Cl, vitamin C, or cranberry juice, whereas \nsodium bicarbonate will alkalinize the urine. The clearance of \ndrugs may be different at toxic concentrations than at therapeutic \nconcentrations. For example, in overdoses of phenytoin or salicy\u00ad\nlates, the capacity of the liver to metabolize the drugs is usually \nexceeded, and elimination changes from first-order (constant half\u00ad\nlife) to zero-order (variable half-life) kinetics. \nB. Toxicodynamics \nToxicodynamics denotes the injurious effects of toxins (pharma\u00ad\ncodynamic effects). Knowledge of toxicodynamics can be useful C H A P T E R \nin the diagnosis and management of poisoning. For example, \nhypertension and tachycardia are typically seen in overdoses with \namphetamines, cocaine, and antimuscarinic drugs. Hypotension \nwith bradycardia occurs with overdoses of calcium channel block\u00ad\ners, P blockers, and sedative-hypnotics. Hypotcnsion with tachy\u00ad\ncardia occurs with tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and \ntheophylline. H yperthermia is most frequently a result of overdose \nof drugs with antimuscarinic actions, the salicylates, or sympatho\u00ad\nmimetics. Hypothermia is more likely to occur with toxic doses \nof ethanol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. \nIncreased respiratory rate is often a feature of exposure to carbon \nmonoxide or overdose with salicylates, and other drugs that cause \nmetabolic acidosis or cellular asphyxia. Overdoses of agents that \ndepress the heart are likely to affi:ct the functions of all organ sys\u00ad\ntems that are critically dependent on blood flow, including the \nbrain, liver, and kidney. \nC. Cause of Death in Intoxicated Patients \nThe most common causes of death from drug overdose reflect the \ndrug groups most often selected for abuse or for suicide. Sedative\u00ad\nhypnotics and opioids cause respiratory depression, coma, aspira\u00ad\ntion of gastric contents, and other respiratory malfunctions. Drugs \nsuch as cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), tricyclic antidepressants, \nand theophylline cause seizures, which may lead to vomiting and \naspiration of gastric contents and to postictal respiratory depres\u00ad\nsion. Tricyclic antidepressants and cardiac glycosides cause dan\u00ad\ngerous and frequently lethal arrhythmias. Severe hypotension can \noccur with any of these drugs. A few intoxicants directly damage \nthe liver and kidney. These include acetaminophen, mushroom \npoisons of the Amanita phalloides type, certain inhalants, and \nsome heavy metals (see Chapter 57). \nMANAGEMENT OF THE \nPOISONED PATIENT \nManagement of the poisoned patient consists of maintenance of \nvital functions, identification of the toxic substance, decontami\u00ad\nnation procedures , enhancement of elimination, and in a few \ninstances, administration of a specific antidote. \n493"

Yitai Functions \nThe most important aspect of treatment of a poisoned patient is \nmaintenance of vital functions, as indicated by the mnemonic, \nABCDs. The most commonly endangered or impaired vital func\u00ad\ntion is respiration. Therefore, an open and protected airway (A) \nmust be established first and effective ventilation (B for breathing) \nmust be ensured. The circulation (C) should be evaluated and sup\u00ad\nported as needed. The cardiac rhythm should be determined , and \nif ventricular fibrillation is present, it must be corrected at once. \nThe blood pressure should be measured but rarely needs immedi\u00ad\nate treatment except in cases of traumatic hemorrhage . Because of \nthe danger of brain damage from hypoglycemia, intravenous 50% \ndextrose (D) should be given to comatose patients immediately \nafter blood has been drawn for laboratory tests and before labora\u00ad\ntory results have been obtained. Thiamine should be administered \nto prevent W ernicke syndrome in patients with suspected alco\u00ad\nholism or malnourishment. In patients with signs of respiratory \nor CNS depression, intravenous naloxone offiets possible toxic \neffects of opioid analgesic overdose. Flumazenil, an antidote to \nbenzodiaupines, is not used routinely, as it can trigger seizures. \nB. ldentffkation of Poisons \nMany intoxicants cause a characteristic syndrome of clinical and \nlaboratory changes. Table 58-1 summarizes toxic syndromes asso\u00ad\nciated with major drug groups and the key interventions called \nfor. The toxic features of selected individual agents are listed in \nTable 58-2. When the toxic agent cannot be directly examined and \nidentified, the clinician must rely on indirect means to identify the \ntype of intoxication and the progress of therapy. In addition to the \nhistory and physical examination, certain laboratory examinations \nmay be useful. A few intoxicants can be directly identified in the \nblood or urine, especially when information in the history narrows \nthe search. In the more common situation of a comatose patient \nunable to provide a history, general tests for replacement of anions \nor osmotic equivalents in the blood (anion gap, osmolal gap) may \nbe useful. A few intoxicants can be identified or strongly suspected \non the basis of electrocardiographic or radiologic findings. \nf. Osmo/e gap-The osmole gap is the difference between \nthe measured serum osmolality (measured by the freezing point depression method) and the osmolality predicted by measured \nserum concentrations of sodium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen: \nGap= Osm {measured)-((2 x Na\u2022 [mEQ/L]) \n+ (Glucose [mg/dl] + 18) + (BUN [mg/dL] + 3)) \nThis gap is normally zero. A significant gap is produced by high \nserum concentrations of intoxicants of low molecular weight such \nas ethanol, methanol , and ethylene glycol. \n2. Anion gap-The anion gap is the difference between the sum \nof the measured serum concentrations of the 2 primary cations, \nsodium and potassium, and the sum of the measured serum con\u00ad\ncentrations of the 2 primary anions, chloride and bicarbonate: \nAnion gap = {Na+ + Ki -{HCO] + Cll \nThis gap is normally 12-16 mEq/L. A significant increase \ncan be produced by diabetic ketoacidosis , renal failure, or drug\u00ad\ninduced metabolic acidosis. Drugs that cause an anion gap include \ncyanide, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ibuprofen , isoniazid, iron, meth\u00ad\nanol, phenelzine , salicylates, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, and \nverapamil . \n3. Serum potassium-Myocardial function is critically depen\u00ad\ndent on serum potassium level. Drugs that cause hyperkalemia \ninclude P,.adrenoceptor blockers, digitalis (in overdose), fluoride, \nlithium, and potassium-sparing diuretics. Drugs associated with \nhypokalemia include barium, P-adrenoceptor agonists, methyl\u00ad\nxanthines, most diuretics, and toluene. \nC. Decontamination \nDecontamination is the removal of any unabsorbed poison from \nthe skin or gastrointestinal tract (Figure 58-1). In the case of topical \nexposure (insecticides, solvents), the clothing should be removed \nand the patient washed to remove any chemical still present on the \nskin. Medical personnel must be careful not to contaminate them\u00ad\nselves during this procedure . For most cases of ingested toxins, \nactivated cbarcoal, given orally or by stomach tube, is very effec\u00ad\ntive in adsorbing any toxin remaining in the gut. Poisons that can \nbe removed by multiple treatments with activated charcoal include \namitriptyline, barbiturates, carbamazcpine, digitalis glycosides, \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

Anion gap is calculated by subtracting measured serum \nanions (bicarbonate plus chloride) from cations (potassium \nplus sodium). Increases in anion gap above normal are due to \nthe presence of unmeasured anions that accompany acidosis. \nThe gap in this case is 30 mEq/L, a value that is well in excess \nof the normal gap (12-16 mEq/L). The answer is D. \n2. The osmole gap is the difference between the measured serum \nosmolality and the osmolality calculated from the scrum \nsodium, glucose, and BUN concentrations according to the \nequation above for calculating the osmole gap. In this case, the \nmeasured osmolality is 300 mOsm/L, whereas the calculated \nosmolality is 305 mOsm/L; the difference is -5 mOsm/L. The \nanswer is B. \n3. Of the drugs listed, the 2 that are likely to cause an anion \ngap are aspirin and ethylene glycol. However, if the child had \ningested ethylene glycol, she would be expected to exhibit a \nsignificant osmole gap. The anion gap, lethargy, tachypnea, \nand hyperthermia all are consistent with aspirin poison\u00ad\ning. The answer is B. Mnemonic for causes of anion gap: \nMUDPILERS (methanol, metformin, uremia, ketoacidosis, \nparaldehyde, phenformin, isoniazid, lactic acidosis, ethylene \nglycol, ethanol, renal failure, salicylates). \n4. Glucagon (see Chapter 41) stimulates heart rate and contrac\u00ad\ntility through cardiac glucagon receptors that are coupled to \nadenylyl cyclase and the cAMP signaling pathway. This ability \nto increase cardiac cAMP without requiring access to p recep\u00ad\ntors makes it valuable for P-blocker overdose. The answer is C. \nS. In this woman with severe signs of poisoning due to the inges\u00ad\ntion of metformin, hemodialysis can be used to accelerate the \nelimination of both metformin and lactic acid. Since most of \nthe metformin has been absorbed by the time she presented \n(9 h after drug ingestion), efforts to decontaminate her gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal tract with activated charcoal, gastric lavage, or \nsyrup of ipecac are unlikely to be beneficial. Furthermore, \nsyrup of ipecac has fallen out of favor and should not be used \nin unconscious patients. Unlike other drugs used to treat type \n2 diabetes, metformin in overdose is unlikely to cause hypo\u00ad\nglycemia (see Chapter 41), and this patient's serum glucose \nis in the normal range so that glucagon administration is not \nrequired. The answer is E. \n6. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are extremely \ntoxic in overdose because of their effects in the CNS and car\u00ad\ndiovascular system.

Drugs Used In Acid-Peptic Diseases \nUlceration and erosion of the lining of the upper portion of the \ngastrointestinal tract are common problems that manifest as gas\u00ad\ntroesophageal reflux disease (GERO), gastric and duodenal peptic \nulcers, and stress-related mucosa! injury. Drugs used in acid-peptic \ndisease reduce intragastric acidity by manipulating systems con\u00ad\ntrolling acid secretion (Figure 59-1), promote mucosal defense or, \nin the case of peptic ulcers, eradicate the bacterium Helicobacter \npylori, which is detectable in over 80% of patients with duodenal \nulcers. \n1. Antacids-Antacids are weak bases that neutralize stomach \nacid by reacting with protons in the lumen of the gut and may also \nstimulate the protective functions of the gastric mucosa. When \nused regularly in the large doses needed to significantly raise the \nstomach pH, antacids reduce the recurrence rate of peptic ulcers. \nThe antacids differ mainly in their absorption and effects on \nstool consistency. Popular antacids include magnesium hydrox\u00ad\nide (Mg[OH]i) and aluminum hydroxide (Al[OHh). Neither of \nthese weak bases is significantly absorbed from the bowd. Mag\u00ad\nnesium hydroxide has a strong laxative effect, whereas aluminum \nhydroxide has a constipating action. These drugs are available as \nsingle-ingredient products and as combined preparations. Cal\u00ad\ncium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate are also weak bases, but \nthey differ from aluminum and magnesium hydroxides in being \nabsorbed from the gut. Because of their systemic effects, calcium \nand bicarbonate salts are less popular as antacids. \n2. H2-receptor antagonists-Ci.metid.ine and other H2 antag\u00ad\nonists (raniticline, famoticline, and nizatidine) inhibit stomach \nacid production, especially at night. They are effective in the \ntreatment of GERO, peptic ulcer disease, and nonulcer dyspep\u00ad\nsia and in the prevention of stress-related gastritis in seriously ill \npatients. Although they are still used widdy, their clinical use is being supplanted by the more effective and equally safe proton \npump inhibitors. The H2 antagonists are described in detail in \nChapter 16. \n3. Proton pump lnhlbltors-Omeprazole and other proton \npump inhibitors (esomeprawle, (dex)lansoprawle, pantopra\u00ad\nzole, and rabeprazole) are lipophilic weak bases that diffuse into \nthe parietal cell canaliculi, where they become protonated and \nconcentrated more than 1000-fold. There they undergo conver\u00ad\nsion to compounds that irreversibly inactivate the parietal cell \nH+ /K+ ATPase, the transporter that is primarily responsible for \nproducing stomach acid. Oral formulations of these drugs are \nenteric coated to prevent acid inactivation in the stomach. After \nabsorption in the intestine, they are rapidly metabolized in the \nliver, with half-lives of 1-2 h. However, their durations of action \nare approximately 24 h, and they may require 3-4 d of treatment \nto achieve their full effectiveness. \nProton pump inhibitors are more effective than H2 antagonists \nfor GERO and peptic ulcer and equally effective in the treatment \nof nonulcer dyspepsia and the prevention of stress-rdated mucosa! \nbleeding. They are also useful in the treatment of gastrinoma and \nother hypersecretory conditions. Adverse effects of proton pump \ninhibitors occur infrequently and include diarrhea, abdominal \npain, and headache. Chronic treatment with proton pump inhibi\u00ad\ntors may result in hypergastrinemia. However, there is no docu\u00ad\nmentation that the use of these drugs increases the incidence of \ncarcinoid or colon cancer. Proton pump inhibitors may decrease \nthe oral bioavailability of vitamin B12 and certain drugs that \nrequire acidity for their gastrointestinal absorption (eg, digoxin, \nketoconazole).

Drugs That Promote Upper Gastrointestinal Motility \nProkinetic drugs that stimulate upper gastrointestinal motility \nare helpful for gastroparesis and for postsurgical gastric emptying \ndelay. Their ability to increase lower esophageal sphincter pres\u00ad\nsures also makes them useful for some patients with GERO. In the \npast, cholinomimetic agonists such as bethanechol were used for \nGERO and gastroparesis, but the availability of less toxic agents \nhas supplanted their use. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neo\u00ad\nstigmine is still used for the treatment of hospitalized patients with \nacute nonobstructive large bowel distention. The cholinomimetics \nare discussed in Chapter 7. \nIn the enteric nervous system, dopamine inhibits cholinergic \nstimulation of smooth muscle contraction. Metoclopramide and \ndomperidone are D2 dopamine receptor antagonists that promote \ngastrointestinal motility. The D2 receptor-blocking action of these \ndrugs in the area postrema is also of value in preventing emesis \nafter surgical anesthesia and emesis induced by cancer chemo\u00ad\ntherapeutic drugs. When used chronically, metoclopramide can \ncause symptoms of parkinsonism, other extrapyramidal effects, \nand hyperprolactinemia. Because it does not cross the blood-brain \nbarrier, domperidone is less likely to cause CNS toxicity. \nThe macrolide antibiotic eiythromycin (see Chapter 44) pro\u00ad\nmotes motility by stimulating motilin receptors. It may have ben\u00ad\nefit in some patients with gastroparesis. \nC. Laxatives \nLaxatives increase the probability of a bowel movement by several \nmechanisms: an irritant or stimulant action on the bowel wall; a \nbulk-forming action on the stool that evokes reflex contraction of the \nbowel; a softening action on hard or impacted stool; and a lubricating \naction that eases passage of stool through the rectum. Examples of \ndrugs that act by these mechanisms are listed in Table 59-1. \nD. Antldlarrheal Agents \nThe most effective antidiarrheal drugs are the opioids and deriva\u00ad\ntives of opioids that have been selected for maximal antidiarrheal \nTABLE 59-1 The major laxative mechanisms and \nsome representative laxative drugs. \nMechanism Exampl\u2022s \nBulk-forming Psylllum, methylcellulose, polycarbophll \nStool-softening Docusate, glycerin, mineral oll \nOsmotic Magnesium oxide, sorbltol, lactulose, \nmagnesium citrate, sodium phosphate, \npolyethylene glycol \nStimulant Aloe, senna, cascara, castor oll, blsacodyl \nChloride channel activator Lubiprostone \nLinaclotide (indirect via cGMP) \nOpioid receptor Methylnaltrexone, alvimopan \nantagonists and minimal CNS effect. Of the latter group, the most imponant \nare dipbcnoxylate and lopen.mide, meperidine analogs with very \nweak analgesic effects. Diphenoxylate is formulated with antimus\u00ad\ncarinic alkaloids (eg, atropine) to reduce the likelihood of abuse; \nloperarnide, which has much lower abuse potential, is formulated \nalone and is available over the counter. Kaolin, a naturally occur\u00ad\nring hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate, is combined with \npectin, an indigestible carbohydrate derived from apples in a pop\u00ad\nular nonprescription preparation that absorbs bacterial toxins and \nfluid, resulting in decreased stool liquidity. They can cause consti\u00ad\npation and interfere with absorption of other drugs. Antidiarrheal \nagents may be used safely in patients with mild to moderate acute \ndiarrhea. However, these agents should not be used in patients \nwith bloody diarrhea, high fever, or systemic toxicity because of \nthe risk of worsening the underlying condition. \nE. Drugs Used for Irritable Bowel Syndrome \nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with recurrent epi\u00ad\nsodes of abdominal discomfon (pain, bloating, distention, or \ncramps) plus diarrhea or constipation (or both). The pharmaco\u00ad\nlogic strategy is tailored to patients' symptoms and includes antidi\u00ad\narrheal agents and laxatives, and for the treatment of abdominal \npain, low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (Chapter 30). The anti\u00ad\ncholinergic drugs dicyclomine and hyoscyamine are used as anti\u00ad\nspasmodics to relieve abdominal pain; however, their efficacy has \nnot been convincingly demonstrated. Alosetron, a potent 5-HT3 \nantagonist, is approved for treatment of women with severe IBS \nwith diarrhea. Alosetron can cause constipation, including rare \ncomplications of severe constipation that have required hospital\u00ad\nization or surgery, and rare cases of ischemic colitis. For this rea\u00ad\nson, its use is restricted. Lubiprostone, a laxative that activates \nthe type 2 chloride channels in the small intestine, is approved \nfur treatment of women with IBS with predominant constipation. \nLinadotide has a similar therapeutic effect but acts more indi\u00ad\nrectly: It binds to and activates guanylyl cyclase-C on the luminal \nintestinal epithelial surface, resulting in increased intracellular and \nextracellular cGMP, which in turn leads to activation of the type \n2 chloride channels. \nF. Drugs with Antiemetic Actions \nA variety of drugs are valuable in the prevention and treatment of \nvomiting, especially cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting. In \naddition to metodopramide and other D2 dopamine receptor \nantagonists, useful antiemetics include drugs with H1 histamine\u00ad\nblocking activity including diphenbydramine (see Chapter 16); \nseveral phcnothiazines and haloperidol (see Chapter 29); antl\u00ad\nmuscarinic drugs such as scopolamine (see Chapter 8); the corti\u00ad\ncosteroid deumetbasone (see Chapter 39); and the cannabinoid \nreceptor agonises dronabinol and nabilone (see Chapters 32 and \n60). The 5-HT3 antagonists (see Chapter 16) ondansetron, \ngranisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron are particularly useful \nin preventing nausea and vomiting after general anesthesia and in \npatients receiving cancer chemotherapy.

The precise mechanism of 5-ASA action is uncenain \nbut may involve inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins and \ninflammatory leukotrienes, and interfering with the production of \ninflammatory cytokines. 5-ASA, known generically as mesalamine, \nis readily absorbed from the small intestine, whereas absorption \nfrom the colon is extremely low. Proprietary coated formulations \nof 5-ASA (Pentasa, Asacol, Lialcla) deliver 5-ASA to different seg\u00ad\nments of the small and large intestine (Figure 59-2). Balsalazide, \nolsalazine, and sulfualazine contain 5-ASA bound by an azo \n(N = N) bond to an inert compound, another 5-ASA molecule, \nor sulfapyridine. The azo structure is poorly absorbed in the small \nintestine. Sulfasalazine (a combination of 5-ASA and sulfapyri\u00ad\ndine) has a higher incidence of adverse effects than the other 5-ASA \ndrugs, due to the systemic absorption of the sulfapyridine moiety. \nThese effects are dose related and include nausea, gastrointestinal \nupset, headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, bone marrow suppression, \nmalaise, and severe hypersensitivity reactions. Other aminosalicy\u00ad\nlates, which do not contain sulfapyridine, are better tolerated. \nStomach I Small Intestine CHAPTER 59 Drugs Used in Gastrointestinal Disorders 505 \nDisease \nseverity \nSevere Therapy \nSurgery \nNatalizumab \nCyclosporine \nTNF antagonists \nIntravenous corticosteroids \nTNF antagonists Responsiveness \nto therapy \nRefractory \nModerate Oral corticosteroids \nMethotrexate \nAzathioprine/'6-Mercaptopurine ,. \nMid Budesonlde OlelUs) \nTopical corticosteroids (proctltls) \nAntibiotics \n5-Amlnosallcylates \\ \nFIGURE 59-3 Therapeutic pyramid approach to Inflammatory \nbowel disease.

This is a small molecule that polymerizes in stomach acid and \ncoats the ulcer bed, resulting in accelerated healing and reduc\u00ad\ntion of symptoms. \nANSWERS \nI. Of the drugs listed, only metoclopramide is considered a pro\u00ad\nkinetic agent (ie, one that increases propulsive motility in the \ngut}. The answer is D. Alosetron is a 5HT3 receptor blocker, \ncimetidine is a H2 receptor blocker, loperamide is an opioid, \nand sucralfate forms a protective layer over an ulcer. \n2. A laxative that mildly stimulates the gut would be most suit\u00ad\nable in a patient taking a smooth muscle relaxant drug such \nas verapamil. By holding water in the intestine, magnesium \nhydroxide provides additional bulk and stimulates increased \ncontractions. A helpful mnemonic is magnesium \"magnifies\" \nstool, aluminum hALts the stool. The answer is C. Diphenox\u00ad\nylate is an opioid receptor agonist, metoclopramide is a proki\u00ad\nnetic agent, ranitidine is a H2 receptor blocker. \n3. Esomeprazole, the (S} isomer of omeprazole, is a prodrug \nconverting spontaneously in the parietal cell canaliculus to \na sulfonamide that irreversibly inactivates the proton pump. \nThe answer is C. \n4. Mesalamine is a form of 5-aminosalicylic acid that is active in the \nlarge intestine and thereby provides a local anti-inflammatory \neffect that is useful in Crohn disease, a form of inflammatory \nbowel disease. The answer is C. \n5. Serotonin plays a major regulatory role in the enteric nervous \nsystem, and the potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alosetron \nhas shown efficacy in treating women with IBS that is accom\u00ad\npanied by diarrhea.

Aluminum hydroxide is constipating but is not related chemi\u00ad\ncally to meperidine; magnesium hydroxide is a strong laxa\u00ad\ntive. The 2 antidiarrheal drugs that are structurally related to \nopioids are diphenoxylate and loperamide. Loperamide is \navailable over the counter; diphenoxylate is mixed with atro\u00ad\npine alkaloids, and the product (Lomotil, others} requires a \nprescription. The answer is C. \n7. The macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin is commonly used in \nantibiotic regimens designed to treat duodenal ulcers caused \nby H pylori. The other antibiotics that are used include amox\u00ad\nicillin, tetracycline, and metronidazole. Bismuth also has an \nantibacterial action. The answer is C. \n8. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are highly effective at pre\u00ad\nventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, which \ncan be a dose-limiting toxicity of anticancer drugs. The \nanswer is D. \n9. Linaclotide is approved for the treatment of chronic consti\u00ad\npation and IBS with predominant constipation. Linaclotide \nactivates guanylyl cyclase-C on the luminal intestinal epi\u00ad\nthelial surface, which leads to activation of the cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leading to \nincreased chloride-rich secretion and acceleration of intestinal \ntransit.

The \nanswer is L \nSKILL KEEPER ANSWER: 5-HT AGONISTS &: \nANTAGONISTS (SEE CHAPTERS 16 AND 30) \nThe only serotonin agonists in common use are the 5-HT10\u2022 \nselective agonists such as sumatriptan and its congeners \n(see Chapter 16) that are used in migraine. Ergot alkaloids \nare partial agonists at several 5-HT receptors and are also \nused in migraine and other conditions. Several valuable anti\u00ad\ndepressants are inhibitors of the serotonin reuptake pump \nin neurons (see Chapter 30). Serotonin antagonists indude \ncyproheptadine (also an H1 blocker), phenoxybenzamine \n(also an a blocker), and several of the atypical antipsychotic \ndrugs (eg, olanzapine, aripiprazole; see Chapter 29), which \nhave high affinity for 5-HT v. receptors. Cyproheptadine \nis used for pruritus and sometimes for carcinoid tumor. \nPhenoxybenzamine is used for carcinoid tumor as well as for \npheochromocytoma. 5-HT3 receptors are blocked by ondan\u00ad\nsetron and its congeners. These drugs are extremely useful in \npreventing postoperative and cancer chemotherapy-induced \nnausea and vomiting."

Classification \nThree cannabinoids are currently approved by the FDA for medi~ \ninal use in the USA. The first two, nabilone and dronabinol, are \nschedule II medications. Dronabinol is the synthetic form of ddta-\n9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), whereas nabilone is a synthetic \nsubstance with a chemical structure similar to dronabinol. The \nprimary target fur both dronabinol and nabilone is the CB1 recep\u00ad\ntor. The third FDA-approved cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), \na schedule V drug. Although CBD is classified as a cannabinoid, it \ndoes not have activity at the CB1 or the CB2 receptor. Its mecha\u00ad\nnism of action is therefore unknown at present. \nFinally, medical marijuana, which is currently a schedule I \nsubstance and federally illegal in the USA, but approved by mul\u00ad\ntiple states, is widdy available in a variety of formulations and is \nbeing prescribed fur a number of medical conditions. Medical \nmarijuana, which contains over 50 different cannabinoid mol\u00ad\necules, has activity at the CB1 and CB2 receptors as well as other \nunidentified sites. \nC. Clinical Uses \nNabilone is approved to treat nausea and vomiting associated with \ncancer chemotherapy in people who have taken other drugs with\u00ad\nout rdief of chronic pain, anorexia, and weight loss. Dronabinol \nis also approved to treat anorexia and weight loss in people with \nAIDS. As discussed in Chapter 24, CBD is approved fur seizures \nassociated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. \nMedical marijuana is prescribed for multiple conditions includ\u00ad\ning pain, glaucoma, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD}, \nnausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, loss of \nappetite and weight loss, muscle spasms, and epilepsy. \nD. Toxicity \nCommon adverse effects fur dronabinol and nabilone include \npsychotropic effects, lethargy, drowsiness , ataxia, and dry mouth. \nMore rardy they result in euphoria. These effects are due to the \ncannabinoids engaging the CB 1 receptor and are similar to the side \neffects of THC. CBD for the most part has been wdl tolerated \nand lacks the psychoactive and euphoric effects seen with the CB1 agonists. On the other hand, medical marijuana has been shown to \nproduce a number of minor-to-moderate adverse effects including \npsychoactive effects, tiredness, dizziness, impaired motor coordi\u00ad\nnation, cardiovascular effects (ie, tachycardia, peripheral vasodila\u00ad\ntion, hypotension}, impaired short-term memory, and psychosis \nat increased doses. \nTHE FUTURE OF CANNABINOID \nMEDICATIONS \nNabmmols (Sativex) is an additional cannabinoid that is currently \nmarketed in Europe, Canada, and some areas of the Middle East, \nAfrica, and Asia. Nabiximols contains equal amounts ofTHC and \nCBD and has been approved for use in multiple sclerosis spastic\u00ad\nity, neuropathic pain, and overactive bladder. \nRecently, a biologic drug, namacizumab, has been intro\u00ad\nduced fur nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a frequent comorbidity of \nabdominal obesity. Namacizumab is a negative allosteric antibody \nthat stabilizes CB1 receptors in an inactive conformation. Like \nmany biologics, namacizumab is probably restricted to the periph\u00ad\nery; it does not result in CNS effects. \nENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS \nSince the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid system, novd \nmethods to increase or decrease production of endogenous can\u00ad\nnabinoid agonists have led to the discovery of enzymes that are \ncurrently targeted by new pharmaceuticals. Anandamide (AEA) \nand 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), two endogenous cannabi\u00ad\nnoids, are synthesized from lipids of the cell membrane by the \ntargeted enzymes, and are under preclinical studies for obesity, \ninflammation, and pain. Several experimental compounds that \ninhibit the enzymes that break down AEA (eg, FAAH, fatty \nacid amide hydrolase), 2-AG (eg, MAGL, monoacylglycerol \nlipase), and ABHD6 (a/~-hydrolase domain-containing pro\u00ad\nteins} are making their way through the preclinical and safety \npipeline. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "C H A P T E R \nDietary Suppletnents & \nHerbal Medications* \nDietary supplements, which include substances known as botani\u00ad\ncal and herbal medications, are available without prescription and, \nunlike over-the-counter medications, are considered to be nutri\u00ad\ntional supplements rather than drugs. These substances are mar\u00ad\nketed in the United States without FDA or other governmental \npremarketing review of efficacy or safety, and with little govern\u00ad\nment oversight of purity, variations in potency, or adverse effects. \nThe burden of proof of harm lies with the FDA, before a product \ncan be removed from the market. Purified nonherbal nutritional \nsupplements such as coenzyme Q 10 and melatonin are also used \nwiddy by the general public in pursuit of \"alternative medicine.\" \nFor many herbal products and nutritional supplements, evidence \nfrom controlled clinical studies for their medical effectiveness is \nincomplete or nonexistent. A summary of the intended uses of \nsome herbal products and nutritional supplements is presented in \nTable 61-1. \nBOTANICAL SUBSTANCES \nA. Echinacea \nf. Nature-Leaves and roots of three echinacea species (Echinacea \npurpurea, E pallida, and E angustifolia) contain flavonoids, poly\u00ad\nacetylenes, and caffeoyl conjugates. \n2. Pharmacology-In vitro studies have shown that echinacea \nhas cytokine activation and anti-inflammatory properties. There \nis some evidence for the efficacy of aerial (above-ground) parts of \nE purpurea plants in the early treatment of colds. Pooled clinical \ntrials using echinacea for cold prevention show a small risk reduc\u00ad\ntion of 10%, but none of the individual trials show a statistically \nsignificant benefit. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Unpleasant taste and gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal effects may occur, sometimes with dizziness or head\u00ad\nache. Some preparations have a high alcohol content, but no drug \ninteractions have been reported. Echinacea should be used with \nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rccogni7.cs \"herbal medication\" \nand \"botanical medication\" a& \"dietary supplements.\" For the purposes of this \nchapter, they are identical. \n514 caution by individuals with immune deficiency disorders (AIDS, \nmultiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis). \nB. Ephedra (Ma Huang) \n1. Nature-Ma huang is one of many names given to various \nplants of the genus Ephedra, the major chemical constituents \nof which are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (see Chapter 9). \nEphedrine is a prescription drug in the United States; pseudo\u00ad\nephedrine is available in over-the-counter decongestants. In the \nUnited States, the FDA has banned the marketing of dietary sup\u00ad\nplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, which are considered to \npose an unreasonable cardiovascular risk. The ban is not applicable \nto Chinese herbal remedies. \n2. Pharmacology-The actions of ephedra products are those of \nephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are indirect-acting sympa\u00ad\nthomimetics that release norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve \nendings (see Chapter 9). In addition to nasal decongestion, the \nestablished clinical use of ephedrine is as a presser agent. Ephedra \nherbal products are commonly used for treatment of respiratory \ndysfunction, including bronchitis and asthma, and as mild CNS \nstimulants. In Chinese medicine, ephedra products are also used \nfor rdief of cold and flu symptoms, for diuresis, and for bone or \njoint pain. Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids \nhave been widely promoted for weight loss and for enhancement \nof athletic performance. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Toxic effects are those of \nephedrine and include dizziness, insomnia, anorexia, flushing, \npalpitations, tachycardia, and urinary retention. In high doses, \nephedra can cause a marked increase in blood pressure, cardiac \narrhythmias, and a toxic psychosis. Contraindications are those for \nephedrine and include anxiety states, bulimia, cardiac arrhythmias, \ndiabetes, heart f.rilure, hypertension, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, \nand pregnancy. As a weak base, renal elimination of ephedrine in \noverdose can be facilltated by urinary acidification. \nC. Garlic \n1. Nature-Garlic {Allium satiwm) contains organic thiosul\u00ad\nfinates that can form allicin {responsible for the characteristic \nodor) via enzymes activated by disruption of the garlic bulb. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

There is some evidence th.at ginseng may have some \neffect in cold prevention, postprandial glucose reduction, nonspe\u00ad\ncific cancer prevention, and alleviation of cancer-related fatigue. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Estrogenic effects include \nmastalgia and vaginal bleeding. Insomnia, nervousness, and hyper\u00ad\ntension have been reported, with high doses (>3 g/d}. Ginseng \nshould be used cautiously in patients receiving anticoagulant, anti\u00ad\nhypertensive, hypoglycemic, or psychiatric medications. \nF. Milk Thistle \nJ. Nature-Milk thistle is derived from the fruit and seeds of \nSilybum marianum, which contain flavonolignans such as silymarin. \n2. Pharmacology-In vitro studies show that milk thistle reduces \nlipid peroxidation, scavenges free radicals, enhances superoxide dis\u00ad\nmutase, inhibits formation ofleukotrienes, and increases hepatocyte \nRNA polymerase activity. In animal models, milk thistle protects \nagainst liver injury caused by alcohol, acetaminophen, and Amanita \nmushrooms. A systematic review of randomized trials of milk this\u00ad\ntle in patients with alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis found no \nsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality, liver histopathology, or \ncomplications of liver disease. A commercial preparation of silybin \n(an isomer of silymarin} is available in some countries as an anti\u00ad\ndote to Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Other than loose stools, \nmilk thistle does not cause significant toxicity, and there are no \nreports of drug interactions. \nG. St. John's Wort \nJ. Nature-St. John's wort is made from dried flowers of \nHypericum perforatum, which contains the active constituents \nhypericin and hyperforin. \n2. Pharmacology-In vitro studies with hyperforin have shown \ndecreased activity of serotonergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic \nreuptake systems. In animals, chronic treatment with commercial \nextracts led to downregulation of adrenoceptors and upregulation \nof 5-HT receptors. Some (but not all} clinical trials of the extract \nin patients with mild to moderate depression have shown efficacy \nthat is greater than placebo and, in some trials, similar to those \nof prescription antidepressants for mild or moderate depression. \nHypericin, when photoactivated, may have antiviral and antican\u00ad\ncer effects. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Mild gastrointestinal \nside effects occur, and photosensitization has been reported with \nSt. John's wort. It should be avoided in patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRis} or monoamine oxidase \n(MAO} inhibitors and in those with a history of bipolar or psy\u00ad\nchotic disorder. Constituents in St. John's wort induce the for\u00ad\nmation of cytochrome P450 isoforms and P-glycoprotein drug \ntransporter. Decreases in effectiveness of birth control pills, cyclo\u00ad\nsporine, digoxin, HIV protease inhibitors, and warfarin have been \nreported in patients who regularly use St. John's wort. \nH. Saw Palmetto \nJ. Nature-Saw palmetto is derived from the berries of Smnoa \nrepens or Sabal serru/a,ta and contains phytosterols, aliphatic alco\u00ad\nhols, polyprenes, and flavonoids. \n2. Pharmacology-In vitro studies have shown inhibition of \n5-reductase and antagonistic effects at androgen receptors. Clinical \ntrials of saw palmetto in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH} have \nbeen mixed. Some have shown improvement in urologic function \nand in urinary flow. Others, including a recent well-controlled, \ndouble-blind 1-year study in moderate to severe BPH, have shown \nno significant effects on symptoms or objective measures. \n3. Toxicity and drug interactions-Abdominal pain with gas\u00ad\ntrointestinal distress, decreased libido, headache, and hypertension \noccur; overall incidence was less than 3%. Saw palmetto has no \neffect on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA} marker. \nSKILL KEEPER: DRUGS FROM PLANT \nSOURCES \nMany conventional drugs, strictly regulated by governmental \nagencies such as the FDA, originated from plant sources. How \nmany of these compounds can you identify? \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end of the chapter. \nPURIFIED NUTRITIONAL SUBSTANCES \nA. Coenzyme Q1 O \nJ. Nature-Coenzyme QlO, also known as CoQ, CoQlO, and \nubiquinone, is a benzoquinone that serves as a cofactor in the \nmitochondrial electron transport chain and, in its reduced form of \nubiquinol, serves as an important antioxidant. After ingestion, the \nreduced form predominates in the circulation. \n2. Pharmacology-Coenzyme Q 10 may have a small degree of \nefficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in \ntreating coronary artery disease and chronic stable angina, but it \ndoes not appear to be useful as adjunctive therapy of heart failure. \nCoenzyme QlO may have some efficacy in reducing muscle pain \nin patients with statin-related myopathy. \n3.

Coenzyme Q 10 has structural similarity to vitamin K and \ncan decrease the effects of warfarin. \nB. Glucosamine \n7. Nature-Glucosaminc is an amino sugar that serves as the pre\u00ad\ncursor of nitrogen-containing sugars, including the glycosamino\u00ad\nglycans that are a major constituent of connective tissue, including \nthe cartilage in joints. \n2. Pharmacology-Glucosamine is primarily used for pain asso\u00ad\nciated with osteoarthritis. The many clinical trials examining the \nuse of oral or intra-articular glucosaminc have produced mixed \nresults. Although some early trials and a meta-analysis found a \nbeneficial effect in osteoarthritis, a recent large placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind trial failed to find a benefit for glucosamine in treat\u00ad\ning osteoarthritis. This could be due to the formulations used. The \nformulation of glucosamine plays an important role with regard to \nefficacy; the glucosaminc hydrochloride formulation is inferior to \nthe sulfate formulation. \n3. Toxicity-Glucosamine can occasionally cause diarrhea and \nnausea but otherwise is well tolerated. Because glucosamine is \ncommercially prepared from crustaceans, there is some concern \nabout cross-allergenicity in people with shdlfish allergy. Glucos\u00ad\namine may increase international normalized ratio in patients tak\u00ad\ning warfarin. \nC. Melatonln \n7. Nature-Mdatonin is a serotonin derivative produced mainly \nin the pineal gland (see Chapter 16). It appears to regulate sleep-\u00ad\nwake cycles, and its release coincides with darkness (9 PM to 4 AM). \nOther purported activities include contraception, prevention of \naging, protection against oxidative stress, and the treatment of \ncancer, major depression, and HIV infection. \n2. Pharmacology-Melatonin has been used extensively for jet \nlag and insomnia. In jet lag, clinical studies have shown subjective \nimprovements in mood, more rapid recovery times, and reductions \nin daytime fatigue. Melatonin improves sleep onset, duration, and \nquality when given to patients with sleep disorders. Ramdteon \nand tuimdtconJ agonists of melatonin receptors, have been FDA \napproved for sleep disorders (see Chapter 22). Melatonin may also \nreduce pre-and postoperative anxiety in adults. \n3. Toxicity-Sedation and next-day drowsiness and headache \nhave been reported. Melatonin can suppress the midcycle surge of \nluteinizing hormone (LH) and should not be used in pregnancy or \nin women attempting to conceive. Because it can decrease prolactin \nlevels, melatonin should not be used by nursing mothers. In healthy \nmen, chronic melatonin use decreases sperm quality. Melatonin \nis metabolized by cytochrome P450 and is subject to drug-drug \ninteractions. Melatonin may affect blood pressure. Monitoring is \nrecommended for patients on antihypertensive medications. CHAPTER 61 Dietary Supplements & Herbal Medications 517 \nQUESTIONS \nI.

            "Text": "ltnportant Drug \nInteractions & Their \nMechanistns \nDrug interactions occur when one drug modifies the actions of \nanother drug in the body. Drug interactions can result from phar\u00ad\nmacokinetic alterations (eg. changes in absorption, distribution, \nand elimination), pharmacodynamic changes (additive, synergis\u00ad\ntic, or antagonistic effects), or a combination of both. Interactions \nbetween drugs in vitro (eg, precipitation when mixed in solu\u00ad\ntions for intravenous administration) are usually classified as elrug \nineompatibilitia, not drug interactions. \nAlthough hundreds of drug interactions have been documented, \nrelatively few are of enough clinical significance to constitute a con\u00ad\ntraindication to simultaneous use or to require a change in dosage. \nSome of these are listed in Table 62-1. In patients taking many \ndrugs, however, the likelihood of significant drug interactions is \nincreased. Elderly patients have a high incidence of drug interac\u00ad\ntions because they commonly take multiple medications and they \noften have age-related changes in drug clearance. \nPHARMACOKINETIC INTERACTIONS \nA. Interactions Based on Absorption \nAbsorption from the gastrointestinal tract may be influenced by \nagents that bind drugs (eg. resins, antacids, calcium-containing \nfoods), by agents that increase or decrease gastrointestinal motility \n(cg. metoclopramide or antimuscarinics, respectively), and by drugs \nthat alter the P-glycoprotein and organic anion transponers in the \nintestine. Concomitant use of antacids, which increase gastric pH, \ncan decrease gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin, ketoconazolc, \nquinolone antibiotics, and tetracyclines. Compounds in grapefruit \njuice and some drugs inhibit the P-glycoprotein drug transporter \nin the intestinal epithelium and may increase the net absorption of \ndrugs that are normally expelled by the transporter. Absorption from \nsubcutaneous sites can be slowed predictably by vasoconstrictors \ngiven simultaneously (eg, local anesthetics and epinephrine) and by \ncardiac depressants that decrease tissue perfusion (eg. ~ blockers). \na. Interactions Based on Distribution and Binding \nDistribution of a drug can be altered by other drugs that compete \nfor binding sites on plasma proteins. For example, antibacterial C H A P T E R \nsulfonamides can displace methotrexate, phenytoin, sulfonyl\u00ad\nureas, and warfarin from binding sites on albumin. However, it \nis difficult to document many clinically significant interactions of \nthis type, and they seem to be the exception rather than the rule. \nChanges in drug distribution can occur if one agent alters the size \nof the physical compartment in which another drug distributes. \nFor example, diuretics, by reducing total body water, can increase \nplasma levels of aminoglycosides and lithium, possibly enhancing \ndrug toxicities. \nC. Interactions Based on Metabollc Clearance \nDrug interactions of this type are well documented and have con\u00ad\nsiderable clinical significance. The metabolism of many drugs can \nbe increased by other agents that induce hepatic drug-metabolizing \nenzymes, especially cytochrome P450 isozymes. Induction of \ndrug-metabolizing enzymes occurs predictably with chronic \nadministration of barbiturates, carbamazepine, ethanol, phe\u00ad\nnytoin, rifampin, or St. John'1 wort. Conversely, the metabo\u00ad\nlism of some drugs may be decreased by other drugs that inhibit \ndrug-metabolizing enzymes. Such inhibitors of drug-metabolizing \nenzymes include am.iodarone, cimctidinc, disuffiram, c:rythro\u00ad\nmycin, fwanocoumarins (in grapefruit juice), ketoconamle, \nquinidine, ritonavir, sulfonamides, verapamil, and many others. \nThe CYP3A4 isozyrne of cytochrome P450, the dominant form in \nthe human liver, is particularly sensitive to such inhibitory actions. \nDrugs that reduce hepatic blood flow (eg. propranolol) may \nreduce the clearance of other drugs metabolized in the liver, espe\u00ad\ncially those subject to flow-limited hepatic clearance such as mor\u00ad\nphine and verapamil. \nA modified form of an interaction based on metabolic clearance \nresults from the ability of some drugs to increase the stores of endog\u00ad\nenous substances by blocking their metabolism. These endogenous \ncompounds may subsequently be released by other exogenous drugs, \nresulting in an unexpected action. The best-documented reaction \nof this type is the sensitization of patients taking monoamine oxi\u00ad\ndase (MAO) inhibitors to indirectly acting sympathomimetic:s (eg, \namphetamine, phenylpropanolamine). Such patients may suffer a \nsevere hypertensive reaction in response to ordinary doses of cold \nremedies, decongestants, and appetite suppressants. \n519"

This Is because \nwarfarin has such a narrow therapeutic window and because \nits metabolism depends on cytochrome P450 activity. How \ndoes this important anticoagulant work, how is its action \nmonitored, and if a drug Interaction leads to an excessive \neffect, how is its action reversed? \nThe Skill Keeper Answer appears at the end ofthe chapter. \nD. Interactions Based on Renal Function \nExcretion of drugs by the kidney can he changed by drugs that \nreduce renal blood flow (eg, ~ blockers) or inhibit specific renal \ntransport mechanisms (eg, the action of aspirin on uric acid secre\u00ad\ntion in the proximal tubule}. Drugs that alter urinary pH can alter \nthe ionization state of drugs that are weak acids or weak bases, \nleading to changes in renal tubular reabsorption. \nPHARMACODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS \nA. Interactions Based on Opposing Actions or Effects \nAntagonism, the simplest type of drug interaction, is often pre\u00ad\ndictable. For example, antagonism of the hronchodilating effects Additive toxicity to gastric mucosa \nIncreased bleeding tendency \nDecreased clearance, causing greater methotrexate toxicity \nDecreased urlcosurlc effect \nSerotonin syndrome (hypertension, tachycardia, muscle rigidity, \nhyperthermia, seizures} \nIncreased risk of digitalis toxicity because thiazides diminish potas\u00ad\nsium stores \nIncreased plasma levels of lithium due to decreased total body water \nof ~2-adrenoceptor activators used in asthma is to be anticipated \nif a p blocker is given for another condition. Likewise, the action \nof a catecholamine on heart rate (via ~-adrenoceptor activation) \nis antagonized by an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that acts \nthrough acetylcholine (via muscarinic receptors}. Antagonism by \nmixed agonist-antagonist drugs (eg, pentazocine) or by partial ago\u00ad\nnists (eg, pindolol} is not as easily predicted hut should be expected \nwhen such drugs are used with pure agonists. Some drug antag\u00ad\nonisms do not appear to be based on receptor interactions. For \nexample, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs} may \ndecrease the antihypenensive action of angiotensin-mnverting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors by reducing renal elimination of sodium. \nB. Interactions Based on Additive Effects \nAdditive interaction describes the algebraic summing of the effects \nof two drugs. The two drugs may or may not act on the same \nreceptor to produce such effects. The combination of tricyclic \nantidepressants with diphenhydramine or promethazine predict\u00ad\nably causes excessive atropine-like effects because all these drugs \nhave significant muscarinic receptor-blocking actions. Tricyclic \nantidepressants may increase the pressor responses to sympatho\u00ad\nmimetics by interference with amine transporter systems. \nOne of the most common and important drug interactions \nis the additive depression of CNS function caused by concomi\u00ad\ntant administration of sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids with each"

In the case of warfarin, the potential fur such adverse \neffects is enhanced by aspirin (via an antiplatelct action), thrombo\u00ad\nlytics {via plasminogen activation), and the thyroid hormones (via \nenhanced dotting factor catabolism). QUESTIONS \nSupra-additive interactions and potentiation appear to be much \nless common than antagonism and the simple additive interac\u00ad\ntions described previously. Supra-additive (synergistic) interaction \nis said to occur when the result of interaction is greater than the \nsum of the drugs used alone; the best example is the therapeutic \nsynergism of certain antibiotic combinations such as sulfonamides \nand dihydrofolic acid reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim. \nPotentiation is said to occur when a drug's effect is increased by \nanother agent that has no such effect.

Thiazides reduce the clearance of lithium by about 25%. \nThey do not alter the clearance of the other agents listed. The \nanswer is D. \n2. Compounds in grapefruit juice can increase the rate and \nextent of bioavailability of several dihydropyridine calcium \nchannel blockers, including felodipine and nifedipine. This \ninteraction may be due to inhibition of the metabolism of \nthe dihydropyridines by intestinal wall CYP3A4 or inhibition \nof the P-glycoprotein transporter in the same location. The \nanswer is C. \n3. This is a good example of an additive drug interaction result\u00ad\ning from 2 drugs acting on the same type of receptor. Most \ntricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and older antihista\u00ad\nminic drugs (those available without prescription) are block\u00ad\ners of muscarinic receptors. Used concomitantly, any pair of \nthese agents will demonstrate a predictable increase in atro\u00ad\npine-like adverse effects. The answer is A. \n4. The drug interaction between the inhibitors of monoamine \noxidase used for depression and the drugs that selectively \nblock serotonin reuptake (SSRis) is called the serotonin syn\u00ad\ndrome. In the case of phenelzine and fluoxetine, the interac\u00ad\ntion has resulted in a fatal outcome. Key interventions include \ncontrol of hyperthermia and seizures. The answer is C. \nS. Rifampin is an effective inducer of hepatic P450 isozymes. \nCyclosporine and tetracycline have no significant effects on \ndrug metabolism. Ciprofloxacin and erythromycin are inhibi\u00ad\ntors of drug metabolism. The answer is D. \n6. NSAIDs interfere with the antihypertensive action of angiotensin\u00ad\nconverting enzyme inhibitors; the other drugs listed enhance \nthe blood pressure-lowering effects of captopril and other \nmembers of the \"pril\" drug family. Pioglitazone is a hypogly\u00ad\ncemic drug used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \nhas no significant effect on blood pressure. The answer is C. \n7. Azathioprine is convened to mercaptopurine, which is \nresponsible for both its immunosuppressant action and its \nhematotoxicity. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, the \nenzyme that metabolizes mercaptopurine. The answer is A. \n8. Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of other HIV protease \ninhibitors and is used in low-dose combinations with indina\u00ad\nvir or lopinavir. The answer is N. \n9. Several NSAIDs, including aspirin, ibuprofen, and piroxi\u00ad\ncam, increase serum levels of methotrexate by interfering \nwith its renal clearance. The adverse effects of methotrexate, \nincluding its hematotox.icity, are predictably increased. The \nanswer isJ. \n10. Concomitant use of St. John's wort enhances the effects of \nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Note that enhance\u00ad\nment is not always positive and too much serotonin is harm\u00ad\nful (serotonin syndrome}. In contrast, the herb decreases the \neffectiveness of other drugs (including cyclosporine, estro\u00ad\ngens, and protease inhibitors) via its induction of drug\u00ad\nmetabolizing enzymes.

            "Text": "APPENDIX \nStrategies for Improving \nTest Perf ortnance \nThere are many strategies for studying and exam taking, and deci\u00ad\nsions about which ones to use are partly a function of individual \nhabit and preference. However, although basic study rules may \nbe applied to any lear.aing exercise. test-taking sttategies depend \no.a the type of examination. For those interested in test-writing \nsttategies, the Billinga reference is strongly recommended (see \nReferences). \nFIVE BASIC STUDY RULES \n1. When studying dense textual material, stop after a few pages \nto write out the main points of it from memory. If nc:c::mary, \nrcfCr back to the material just read. After 6nishing a chapter, \nconstruct your own tables of the major ~. rca:ptor types, \nmechanisms,. and 50 on, and fill in as many or the blanks as you \ncan. Refer to tables and figures in the book as needed to com\u00ad\nplete your notes. Create your own mnemonic& if possible. Look \nup other mnemonics in books if you can't think of one yourself. \nThese are all active learning techniques; mere reading is passive \nand fu less cffi:aivc unl~ you happen to have a photographic \nmemory. Your notes should be legible or typed on a computer, \nand saved fur ready aca:ss when reviewing-fur c:xams. \n2. Experiment with various study methods until you Snd out what \nworks fur you. This may involve solo study or group study, flash \ncards, or tat or question list reading. You won't know how \neffective these techniques are until you have tried them. \n3. Don't scorn \"cramming,\" but don't rely on it either. Some \nsteady, day-by-day reading and digestion of conceptual mate\u00ad\nrial is usually needed to avoid last-minute indigestion. Simi\u00ad\nlarly; don't substitute memorization of lists (eg, the Key Words \nlist, Appendix U) fur more substantive understandi.ag. \n4. If you arc preparing fur a course examination, make every \neffort to attend or review all the class sessions. The lecl'Urer's \nview of what is important may be different from that of the \nauthor of a course textbook, and chances are good that c:um. \nquestions will be based on the instructor's own lecture notes. \nS. If old test questions are legitimately available (as they are fur \nthe USMLE [http://www.usmle.org/practi~materials/] and \ncourses in most professional schools). make use of these guides \nto study. By definition, they are a strong indicator of what the \nexamination writers have considered core information in the \nrecent past (also sec point 4). Use the wrong answers to test \nyoUIScl\u00a3 Do you know the drug class referred to and its mcc:hap \nnism of aaion? If you have trouble with certain concepts or dtug.t, and you repeatedly miss questions on this topic. it hdps \nto create a list of frequently missed fam or concepts for cr.un\u00ad\nming later. Another strategy is to expand the que&tion in the \nfollowing way: If you come across a drug that is eliminated with \n:zero-order kinetics, ask yourself \"what other drugs do I know \nthat are eliminated with uro-order kinetics?\" Similarly, if you \ncome aero\" a question focused on the fact that f} blockers arc \ncontr.lindicatcd in vasospastic angina, you can ask \"what other \nconditions present a contr.lindication to p blocker:s?\" These \nnotes will become your personal high..y:ield list to study from. \nSTRATEGIES APPLICABLE TO \nALL EXAMINATIONS \nThree general rules apply to all examinations: \n1. When starting the examination, scan the entire question set \nbefore answering any. If the examination has several parts, \nallot time to each part in proportion to its length and diffi\u00ad\nculty. Within each part, answer the easy questions first. flag\u00ad\nging the questions to which you will return. Practice saving \nenough time for the more difficult questions by scheduling \n1 minute or less for each question on practice examinations \nsuch as those in Appcndic:e.s III and IV in this book. (The \ntime available in the USMLE examination is approximately \n55-65 seconds per question.) \n2. Students are oficn advised to avoid changing their first guess on \nmultiple-choice questions. However, research has shown that stu\u00b7 \ndents who ~ W1SU1'e of the answer to a question make a change \nfrom the incorrect answer to the correct answer about 55% of \nthe time. So if you are unsure of your first choice fur a particular \nquestion and on further reflection see an answer that looks bet\u00b7 \nter, research supports your making one-but only one-change. \nIf us~ a q~on bank that provides data on the corrcctn~ of \nyour changed answers, use thu data. to decide on a sttatcgy. \n3. Understand the method fur scoring wrong answers. The \nUSMLE does not penallic for wrong answers; it scores you \nonly on the total number of correct answers. Therefore, even \nif you have no idea a& to the correct answer, make a guess \nanyway; there is no penalty for an incorrect answer. In other \nwords, Jo not kavt any blanks on a USMLE amwer shttt or \n\"'mpuur smm. Note that this may not be uue for some local \nexaminations; some scoring algorithms do penallic fur incor\u00b7 \nrcct answers. Make sure you understand the rules fur such \nlocal examinations. \n525"

            "Text": "526 APPENDIX I \nSTRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC \nQUESTION FORMATS \nA certain group of students-often characterized as \"good \ntest-takers\" -may not know every detail about the subject matter \nbeing tested but seem to perform extremely well most of the \ntime. The strategy used by these people is not a secret, although \nfew instructors seem to realize how easy it is to break down their \nquestions into much simpler ones. Lists of these strategies are \nwidely available (eg, in the descriptive material distributed by the \nNational Board of Medical Examiners to its candidates). A para\u00ad\nphrased compendium of this advice is presented next. \nA. Strategies for the \"Choose the One Best Answe..\u00ad\n(of 5 Choices) Type Question \nI. Many of the newer \"clinical correlation\" questions on the \nBoard exam have an extremely long stem that provides a \ngreat deal of clinical data. Some of the data presented may be \nirrelevant. The challenge becomes one of finding out what is \nbeing asked. Sometimes what is being asked is revealed clearly \nin the last sentence of the stem. Another method for dealing \nwith this scenario is to scan the stem and, with the answer \noptions covered, compose your own best answer. Then scan \nthe options to find the best match to your answer. \n2. If 2 statements are contradictory (ie, only 1 can be correct}, \nchances are good that 1 of the 2 is the correct answer (ie, the \nother 3 choices may be distracters). For example, consider the \nfollowing: \n1. In treating cyclizine werrime, an appropriall stmtegy would be to \n(A) Acidify the urine \n(B) Administer a calcium chelator such as EDT A \n(C) Alkalinize the urine \n(D) Give potassium chloride \n(E) Give procainamide \nThe correct answer is A: acidify the urine. \nIn the pair of the correct answer with a contradictory distrac\u00ad\ntor (choices A and C), the instructor revealed what was being \ntested and then used the other three as \"filler.\" Therefore, if \nyou don't know the answer, you are better off guessing A or \nC (a 50% success probability) than A or B or C or D or E \n(a 20% success probability). Note that this strategy is valid \nonly if you mu.tt guess; many instructors introduce contradic\u00ad\ntory pairs as distracters. Another \"rule\" that should be used \nonly if you must guess is the \"longest choice\" rule. When all \nthe answers in a multiple-clioice question are relatively long, \nthe correct answer is often the longest one. Note again that \nsophisticated question writers may introduce especially long \nincorrect choices to foil this strategy. \n3. Statements that contain the words \"always,\" \"never,\" \"must,\" \nand so on are usually false. For example: \nAcetylcholine always increases the heart rate when given intrave\u00ad\nnously because it wwers b/,ood pressure and evokes a strong barore\u00ad\nceptor-mediated reflex tachycardia. \nThe statement is false because, although acetylcholine often \nincreases the heart rate by the reflex mechanism stated, it can \nalso cause bradycardia . (When given as a bolus, it may reach the sinus node in high enough concentration to cause initial \nbradycardia.) The use of trigger words such as \"always\" and \n\"must\" suggests that the instructor had some exception in \nmind. However, be aware that there are a few situations in \nwhich the statement with a trigger word is correct. \n4. Choices that do not flt the stem grammatically are usually \nwrong. For example: \nI. A drug that a.ctr on a fJ receptor and produces a maximal effect \nthat is equal to one half the effect of a large t:Wse of isoprotermol is \ncalleda \n(A) Agonist \n(B) Analog of isoproterenol \n(C) Antagonist \n(D) Partial agonist \nThe use of the article a at the end of the stem rather than an \nimplies that the answer must start with a consonant (ie, choice \nD). Similar use may be made of disagreements in number. \nNote that careful question writers avoid this problem by plac\u00ad\ning the articles in the choice list, not in the stem. \nS. A statement is not false just because changing a few words \nwill make it somewhat more true than you think it is now. \n\"Choose the one best answer\" does not mean \"Choose the \nonly correct statement.\" \nB. Strategies for \"All of the Following Are Accurate \nExcept\" Questions \n1. This type of question is avoided now on the USMLE because \nof problems with ambiguity; however, this type still is used \nin many local examinations because question writers perceive \nthem to be relatively easier to construct. When faced with this \ntype of question, approach it as a nested set of true/false ques\u00ad\ntions in which (hopefully) only one is true. It may hdp to mark \neach choice as either \"T\" or \"F\" as you read through them. \n2. If 2 statements are contradictory, then I of them is certain \nto be the correct (false) answer because they cannot both be \naccurate statements, and yet this type of question cannot have \n2 false answers. For example, consider the following: \nI. All of the following may result from the use of thiazide \ndiuretics EXCEPT \n(A) Hyperglycemia \n(B) Hypernatremia \n(C) Hyponatremia \n(D) Hyperuricemia \n(E) Metabolic alkalosis \nThe correct answer is B: hypernatremia. \nThe possibility that thiazide diuretics do not affect serum \nsodium concentrations is not tenable because that would pro\u00ad\nduce 2 false choices. \n3. If the choices contain 2 drugs that are highly similar, then \nneither is likely to be the correct (false) answer. For example, \nconsider the following: \nI. A young man who had become physiologically depmtlmt after \nillicit use of secobarbital is undergoing s~ withdrawal symp\u00ad\ntoms, including nausea, vomiting, delirium, and periodic sei\u00ad\nzures. Which one of the fo/Jowing drugs will NOT aikviate these \nsymptoms? \n(A) Buspirone \n(B) Chlordiazepoxide \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "(C) Diazepam \n(D) Midazolam \n(E) Phenobarbital \nThe correct answer is A: buspirone. \nIf you recognize that chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and mid\u00ad\nazolam are all benzodiazepine drugs with virtually identical \npharmacologic effects, then you can quite safely rule out all \nthree of them. \nC. Strategies for Matching Type Questions \nMatching questions usually test name recognition, and the most \nefficient approach consists of reading each stem item and then \nscanning the list of choices &om the start and picking the first \nclear \"hit.\" This is especially important on extended matching \nquestions in which just reading the list can be time consuming. \nOccasionally, the strategies described above for the single best \nanswer type question can be applied to the matching and extended \nmatching type. \nD. Strategies for the\"Answer A if 1, 2, and 3 Are Correct\" \nType Question \nThis type of question, known as \"K type,\" has been dropped from \nthe USMLE and therefore is no longer represented among the \npractice questions provided in this Review. However, it is still used \nin many local examinations. \nFor this type of question, one rarely must know the truth about \nall 4 statements to arrive at the correct answer. The instructions \nare to select \n(A) if only (1), (2), and (3) are correct; \n(B) if only (1) and (3) are correct; \n(C) if only (2) and (4) are correct; \n(D) if only (4) is correct; \n(E) if all are correct. \nUseful strategies include the following: \n1. If statement 1 is correct and 2 is wrong, the answer must be \nB (ie, 1 and 3 are correct). You don't need to know anything \nabout 3 or4. \n2. If statement 1 is wrong, then answers A, B, and E are auto\u00ad\nmatically excluded. Concentrate on statements 2 and 4. \n3. The converse of 1 above: If choice 1 is wrong and 2 is correct, \nthe answer must be C (ie, 2 and 4 are correct). \n4. If statement 2 is correct and 4 is wrong, the answer is A (ie, 1 \nand 3 must be correct and you need not even look at them). \n(See example below.) \n5. If statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, the answer must be E. \nYou need not know anything about 3. Strategies for Improving Test Performance 527 \n6. Similarly, if statements 2 and 3 are correct and 4 is wrong, the \nanswer must be A, and statement 1 must be correct. \n7. If statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct, then the answer must be E, \nand statement 1 must be correct. \nNo doubt, more of these rules exist. In general, if you know \nwhether 2 or 3 of the 4 statements in each question are right or \nwrong (ie, 50-75% the material), you should achieve a perfect \nscore on this kind of question. The best way to learn these rules is \nto apply them to practice questions until the principles are firmly \ningrained. \nConsider the following question. Using the above rules, you \nshould be able to answer it correctly even though there is no reason \nwhy you should know anything about the information contained \nin 2 of the 4 statements. The answer follows. \nWhich of the following statements is (are} correct? \n1. The \"struck bushel\" is equal to 2150.42 cubic inches. \n2. Medicine is one of the health sciences. \n3. The fresh meat of the Atlantic salmon contains 220 IU of \nvitamin A per 100 g edible portion. \n4. Gregor Mendel proposed natural selection as the basic mecha\u00ad\nnism of evolution. \nThe answer is A. Because statement 2 is clearly correct and 4 is \njust as patently incorrect Oet's give Darwin the credit), the answer \ncan only be A, and statements 1 and 3 must be correct.

Phase 3 trials are carried out under the \nconditions of proposed use in (usually) several thousand \npatients. Phase 2 trials are carried out (usually) in academic \ncenters under close monitoring. \n2. B (1) According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch principle \n(see Chapter 1), weak acids are less protonated (and more \ncharged) in alkaline media, and weak bases are more proton\u00ad\nated (and more charged) in acidic media. Strong acids and \nbases are fully ionized at any pH. Since the clearance of the \nunknown drug is greater in alkaline urine, the drug must be \na weak acid. \n3. C (9, 13, 15) D igoxin decreases atrioventricular conduction. \nFurosemide does not increase vascular resistance. Of the \nagents listed, only dobutamine increases cAMP. All 3 drugs \nreduce pulmonary edema, albeit by different mechanisms. \n4. D (17) Endothelin is the autacoid most closely associated \nwith pulmonary hypertension, and macitentan is an orally \nactive ETA receptor antagonist. \n5. E (16, 59) Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, very effec\u00ad\ntively reduces gastric acid secretion. The drug is converted \nto an active metabollte that irreversibly inhibits the parietal \ncell tt\u2022 t\u00a5: ATPase that is responsible for acid secretion. \nMisoprostol activates prostaglandin E receptors. Sucralfate \nforms a protective coating over an ulcer bed, and cimetidine \ninhibits H2 histamine receptors. \n6. E (14, 15) Cardiac automaticity is enhanced by hypokale\u00ad\nmia. Thiazides, loop diuretics, and even carbonic anhydrase \ninhibitors can reduce serum potassium levels because they \npresent more sodium to the cortical collecting tubules, \nwhich attempt to compensate by wasting potassium in \nexchange for sodium. The small doses of procainamide that \nthe patient is taking are not sufficient to suppress the new \narrhythmia. \n7. C (35) This patient's pancreatitis suggests that she has \nhypertriglyceridemia as well as cholesterol abnormalities. \nThe treatment includes a statin to lower the patient's LDL, \nhut a second drug is needed to lower the patient's triglycer\u00ad\nides. Cholestyramine is a resin used to lower LDL. Ezeti\u00ad\nmibe inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. Mipomersen \nis an antisense oligo against apoB-100, used to lower LD L in \nFH patients. PCSK9 inhibition with antibodies is reserved \nfor familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients and spe\u00ad\ncifically lowers LDL-cholesterol. Gemflbrozil is the only \ntriglyceride- and VLDL-lowering drug in the list. It is a \nflbrate acting on PPAR-a; the changes in gene transcription \nresult in enhanced fatty acid oxidation and reduced triglyc\u00ad\nerides (VLDL). Note that fibrates are not routinely added to \nstatins, but because her elevated TGs caused symptoms, she \nis candidate for dual therapy. \n8. B (7) The appropriate treatment fur myasthenic crisis is an \nindirect-acting cholinomimetic, the same medication used \nfor chronic therapy of this condition. Neostigmine is the \nonly cholinesterase inhibitor in the list of choices. \n9. D (8, 58) The patient has characteristic signs of antimus\u00ad\ncarinic (also known as anticholinergic) toxicity, caused by \ndrugs such as atropine. Children are especially susceptible to \nthe hyperthermia caused by antimuscarinic drug overdose. Examination 1 553 \n10. B (3) Two hours after an overdose of a drug with a 40-h \nhalf-life, the plasma concentration will approximate that \nimmediately after a loading dose. Using the loading dose \nequation (dose= Yd x c;J. we obtain dose = 80 L x 30 mg!L, \nor 2400 mg, or 2.4 g. \n11. B (27) A drug that antagonizes nicotinic receptors at skeletal \nneuromuscular junctions (eg, cisatracurium) is required to \ninhibit spontaneous, ineffective, respiratory movements. \nSuccinylcholine is not appropriate, partly because it may \ninitially stimulate N-receptors and also because its duration \nof action is very short. \n12. A (8) Atropine has a very long duration of action in the eye \n(>72 h). By interfering with accommodation in the domi\u00ad\nnant eye, atropine can sometimes prevent amblyopia. Timo\u00ad\nlol has no significant effect on accommodation, whereas the \nother drugs listed cause miosis and cyclospasm. \n13. D (36) Naproxen, ibuprofen and indomethacin are the only \nNSAIDs listed here. Indomethacin is more potent and has \nmore adverse effects compared with naproxen and is not the \nfirst NSAID of choice for milder symptoms. Ibuprofen has \na shorter half-Ufe and is less useful for chronic conditions. \nAcetaminophen is not an anti-inflammatory agent and \nreduces fever and pain through an unknown mechanism, \npossibly COX-3 inhibition in the CNS. Sulfasalazine inhib\u00ad\nits the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, \nand TNF-a). \n14. E (33) The most common cause of macrocytic anemia \nis deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12\u2022 The additional \nfinding of neurologic abnormality suggests vitamin Bu \ndeficiency, which is treated with vitamin B12 replacement. \n15. B (34) Rivaroxaban is a direct factor X inhibitor. Anti\u00ad\nthrombin III is the target of heparin; warfarin inhibits \nvitamin K-dependent gamma-carhoxylation of the clotting \nfactors X, IX, VII, and II (mnemonic \"1972\"}; Protein Sis \nan endogenous factor that acts as an anticoagulant. \n16. E (11, 12} Angina pectoris is worsened by tachycardia; vaso\u00ad\ndilators such as hydralazine typically cause increased heart \nrate. A ~ blocker, which reduces heart rate, cardiac work, \nand arterial pressure is most likely to reduce angina. \n17. B (33) G-CSF stimulates neutrophil growth. Eltrombopag, \noprdvekin, and romiplostim stimulate platelets (thrombo\u00ad\ncytes). Vitamin Bu is used to treat megaloblastic anemia. \n18. D (12, 19) Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, isoform 5, are \nuseful in enhancing erection. Note: Because the mechanism \nalso involves increased cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, \nthese drugs also potentiate the hypotensive action of nitrates. \n19. E (35) Rhabdomyolysis is a serious adverse effect that can \noccur with statins. Gallstones are an adverse effect of the \nfibrates; uric acid elevation is an adverse effect of niacin. \n20. E (2, 18) Leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 are the major \nmediators of anaphylaxis, histamine plays a minor role. A \nphysiologic antagonist opposes the action of other drugs by \nacting at a different receptor; the leukotrienes act at cysLT 1 \nand cysLT 2 receptors in the periphery, while epinephrine \nopposes them by acting at a1 and ~2 adrenoceptors. Epi\u00ad\nnephrine also acts at a2 and ~1 adrenoceptors. \n21. C (1) As described in Chapter 1, receptors are usually regu\u00ad\nlatory molecules or enzymes; the vast majority of regulatory \nand enzyme molecules are proteins. \n*Numbers in parentheses are chapters in which more information about the answers is found."

C (41) In order to replicate the physiological situation with \na baseline and mealtime peaks, one needs to combine insu\u00ad\nlin preparations with different durations of action. Review \nduration of action of different insulin formulations in Figure \n41-1. Note that the answers that mix glargine with other \ninsulins are incorrect-due to the low pH of glargine it can\u00ad\nnot be mixed with other insulin formulations. \n23. C (6, 8, 9) Atropine blocks vaga1 and other muscarinic \ncholinergic pathways. Norepinephrine causes vasoconstric\u00ad\ntion and increased blood pressure. The increase in blood \npressure usually evokes a reflex bradycardia that is mediated \nby the vagus nerve. When vagal slowing is blocked, the \nP-agonist action of norepinephrine is unmasked, resulting \nin tachycardia. \n24. B (33) The most common cause of microcytic anemia is \niron deficiency, which can be treated in most patients with \nan oral iron supplement such as ferrous sulfate. \n25. C (2) Quanta! dose-response curves plot the percentage of the \nsubjects that show a specified response (Y-axis) at each incre\u00ad\nment of dosage (X-axis); see Chapter 2, Figure 2-2. \n26. D (6, 8, 10) Isoproterenol causes tachycardia and fucilitates \narrhythmias through its Jl agonise action. A Jl antagonist \nsuch as propranolol can prevent this action. Note that \nchoice B, metaproterenol, is a Jl agonist; metoprolol is a P \nantagonist. \n27. B (8, 20) Antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated in \nAlzheimer disease and glaucoma. They have no useful effect \nin hypertension or supraventricular tachycardia. They can \nproduce useful bronchodilation in COPD and appear to \ncause less cardiac toxicity than sympathomimetics in this \ncondition. \n28. B (34) Clopidogrd is a prodrug, activated by CYP2C9 \nand CYP2C19. The active metabolite irreversibly binds \nADP receptors. Aspirin exerts its antiplatdet effect through \nirreversible inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. Enoxapa\u00ad\nrin is LMW heparin and acts through antithrombin III. \nFondaparinux is a small portion of LMW heparin with \nsimilar actions. T'troflban is a IIb/IIIa protein ligand. \n29. A (40) Finasteride is a 5a-reductase inhibitor and reduces \nthe conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the \nactive form of the hormone in the prostate. Flutamide is an \nandrogen receptor antagonist. Ketoconazole is a cytochrome \nP450 inhibitor (also used as an antifungal agent). Leup\u00ad\nrolide is a GnRH agonist used in depot form for prostate \ncarcinoma. Oxandrolone is an anabolic androgenic steroid. \n30. A (12) Beta blockers usually decrease heart rate but are of \nno value in, and may worsen, vasospastic angina. Nitrates \nusually increase heart rate. Calcium channd blockers such as \ndiltiazem and verapamil decrease heart rate and are valuable \nin vasospastic angina, but nifedipine can increase heart rate. \n31. B (16) Ergotamine is a potent vasoconstrictor but is a partial \nagonise at a adrenoceptors; as such, it can cause epinephrine \nreversal. \n32. C (15) The graph shows a moderate diuresis, some potas\u00ad\nsium wasting, a reduction in urine calcium, and metabolic \nalkalosis. This is most consistent with a thiazide diuretic \nsuch as hydrochlorothiazide. Note that a loop diuretic \nwould have increased urine calcium. \n33. D (13) Digitalis toxicity is associated with hypokalemia \nand hypomagnesemia (and hypercalcemia). Hyperkalemia \n(choice A) is a trap for cardess readers. 34. A (13) Cardiac glycosides act primarily by inhibiting Na+/ \nK\u2022-ATPase and thus increase intracdlular Na+. This in turn \nreduces ca2+ expulsion by the Na\u20221ca2\u2022 exchanger. Excess \ndigitalis results in an excess of intracellular ca2\u00b7. \n35. A (20) This patient has moderate asthma that calls for long\u00ad\nacting controller therapy as prophylaxis. Prednisone therapy \nis appropriate for severe asthma that causes hospitaliza\u00ad\ntions; chronic systemic corticosteroids must be carefully \nmonitored. Montelukast, with or without theophylline, is \nmore appropriate for mild asthma. Theophylline in slow \nrelease form can provide 8-12 h of protection but at the \ncost of significant adverse effects. A long-acting jl2 agonist \n(formoterol or salmeterol) is appropriate for prevention and \nthe combination with a long-acting inhaled corticosteroid \n(eg, budesonide) provides additional efficacy. Ipratropium, \na long-acting antimuscarinic, is useful but not as efficacious \nin prophylaxis as a steroid. \n36. A (20) Skdetal muscle tremor is a common adverse effect \nof P-adrenoceptor agonists such as albuterol when used in \nasthma. This adverse effect (and tachycardia) can occur even \nwhen administered via inhalation . While an antimuscarinic \ncan cause tachycardia, it will not cause tremor, and ipratro\u00ad\npium is not usually absorbed in sufficient quantities to cause \nsystemic antimuscarinic effects. \n37. B {16) Several autacoids may be involved in the edema of \nangioneurotic allergic reactions. Bradykinin and histamine \nare major contributors. \n38. A (10) Beta antagonists typically slow heart rate and increase \nPR interval. Renin secretion and tremor are decreased. Beta \nagonists increase lipolysis. \n39. C (36) Colchicine is used predominantly in prophylaxis of \ngout attacks. Infliximab is a DMARD antibody that reduces \nthe effect ofTNF-<X. Epoprostenol is a prostaglandin (pros\u00ad\ntacyclin, PGI2), and it is used in the treatment of pulmonary \nhypertension. Ketorolac is an NSAID with a strong analge\u00ad\nsic effect and montdukast is a LT 4 receptor antagonist used \nin the treatment of asthma. \n40. B (21} Dopamine exerts slow inhibitory actions at synapses in \nspecific neural systems including the nigrostriatal projections \nvia G-protein-coupled activation of postsynaptic potassium \nchannds or by inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels. \n41. C (22, 23, 58) The patient appears to be suffering from \nthe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which is treated with a \nsedative-hypnotic such as lorazepam or diazepam. Loraz\u00ad\nepam and diazepam are available in parenteral and oral for\u00ad\nmulations. Disulfiram is (rardy) used as aversive therapy to \nprevent alcohol consumption and has little effect on its own. \nMethadone is an opioid and has no role in management of \nalcohol use disorder. \n42. E (23) This patient is at risk for delirium tremens, which \nis characterized by tremors, ddusions, and hallucinations. \n43. D (24) Compared with phenytoin, favorable character\u00ad\nistics of a new antiseizure drug would include good oral \nbioavailability, minimal plasma protein binding, first-order \ndimination kinetics, and neither induction nor inhibition \nof cytochromes P450. \n44. C (25) All of the fuctors listed influence the rate of induction \nof the anesthetic state except the minimal alveolar anesthetic \nconcentration (MAC). MAC reflects potency and is defined as \nthe minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration that eliminates \nresponse to a standard painful stimulus in 50% of patients. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

            "Text": "45. E (25) The onset of anesthesia with propofol is more rapid \nthan intravenous barbiturates. Its clearance is greater than \nhepatic blood flow, which suggests extrahepatic dimination. \nThe drug has antiernetic actions, and recovery is not delayed \nafter prolonged infusion. \n46. C (31) Although miosis is characteristic of all opioids except \nmeperidine, which has a muscarinic blocking action, little \nor no tolerance occurs. Pupillary constriction due to opioids \ncan be blocked by atropine and by naloxone. \n47. D (60) Ibuprofen does not have the indication as an anticmetic \nand will often cause GI upset. Gabapentin is cffcctive as an \nanalgesic but is not used as an antiernetic. Morphine is often \nused for cancer and chernotherapy-induc.cd pain but is not an \nantiemetic and can often cause severe constipation, an unde\u00ad\nsired side effect in colon cancer. The cannabinoid nabilone is an \neffective analgesic and antiemetic and may help chemotherapy\u00ad\ninduc.cd weight loss. Ondansctron is not an analgesic. \n48. C (30) Nefazodone and trazodone are 5-HT2 receptor \nantagonists with both anxiolytic and antidepressant actions. \nIn addition, at a relatively low dose, trazodone is a widely \nused and effective hypnotic with minimal dependence liabil\u00ad\nity compared with most of the sedative-hypnotic drugs used \nin sleep disorders. \n49. B (29, 30) Enhancement of the actions of norepinephrine \nand/or serotonin via inhibition of reuptake transporters \nis characteristic of many antidepressants including the \ntricyclics, SSRis, and SNRis. However, inhibition of the \nreuptake of dopamine leading to enhancement of its CNS \neffects has been equated with thought disorders, delusions, \nhallucinations, and paranoia. \n50. C (30) Enuresis is an established indication for tricyclic anti\u00ad\ndepressants including imipramine, and they are also used \nas backup drugs to methylphenidate in attention deficit \ndisorder. Chronic pain states unresponsive to conventional \nanalgesics may respond to tricyclics. \n51. B (30, 31) Codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone are all \nmetabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6, which can be inhib\u00ad\nited by certain SSRis including fluoxetine and paroxetine. \nThis may lead to decreased analgesic effects of codeine that \nis normally metabolized in pan via CYP2D6 forming the \nmore active compound morphine. \n52. A (39) Cushing syndrome is a consequence of too much steroid \nproduction and is most commonly due to an ACTI-I-secreting \npituitary adenoma. Dexamethasone will suppress ACTI-I \nproduction and thus can be used diagnostically to separate \npituitary Cushing syndrome fiom ectopic ACTI-I-producing \ntumors, which are not suppressed. Fludrocortisone acts mainly \non mineralocorticoid receptors. Glucose is already elevated \nas a consequence of the disease, and adding more will not be \ndiagnostic. Ketoconazole will inhibit male hormone synthesis \nbut will not provide differential diagnostic information. PTU \n(propylthiouracil) inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis. \n53. D (29) Clozapine has greater muscarinic and ex-blocking \nactivity than haloperidol, but neither of these is the primary \nreason why the drug is less likely to cause ex.trapyramidal \ndysfunction. The main reason is that clozapine has very low \naffinity for the dopamine 02 receptor in the striatum. \n54. D (29) Edema and thyroid enlargement are common \nadverse effects of lithium, although the latter does not usu\u00ad\nally involve hypothyroidism. Neurologic adverse effects of \nlithium include tremor, ataxia, and aphasia. Examination 1 555 \n55. D (21, 22) Though not benzodiazepines, zolpidern, zaleplon, \nand eszopiclone exert their hypnotic effects via interaction \nwith receptors closely associated with benzodiazepine recep\u00ad\ntors in the CNS, leading to an increase in GABA-mediated \nchloride ion conductance. \n56. C (22, 58) Diazepam is a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic \ndrug whose action can be competitively inhibited by fluma\u00ad\nzenil. Acctylcystcine is used for acetaminophen overdose. \nAtropine is used in organophosphatc poisoning, fomepizole \nis used for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, and nal\u00ad\noxone is used for opioid overdose. \n57. D (45) In gram-negative bacteria, the primary mechanism of \nresistance to aminoglycosides involves the plasmid-mediated \nformation of inactivating enzymes that acetylate, adenyl\u00ad\nate, or phosphorylate the drug molecule. Such enzymes are \ncalled group transfcrases. \n58. E (3, 34, 61, 62) Warfarin is metabolized by CYP3A4 \n(and CYPlA and CYP2C). The patient's INR is reduced; \nher plasma level of warfarin is subtherapeutic. This means \nthe metabolism of warfarin is induced. St. John's wort is \na potent inducer of CYP3A4. The other drugs do not \nappear to affect the P450 enzyme family. Glucosamine can \naffect the INR but it would increase the INR as opposed \nto reducing it. \n59. B (43) The third-generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone and \ncefotaxime {not listed) are currently the most active beta\u00ad\nlactam antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains \nof H influenzae and Neisseria. However, some resistance has \nbeen reported recently. \n60. D (46) Patients with a history of cardiac irregularities \nshould avoid certain fluoroquinolones including levofloxa\u00ad\ncin and moxifloxacin since they are known to cause QT \nprolongation. \n61. C (43, 50) The anaerobic bacterium C/ostridium diffidle is \na cause of life-threatening pseudomernbranous colitis. The \nprimary drugs used in management of such infections are \noral vancomycin or fldaxomicin {not listed). Metronidazole \n(not listed) is an alternative treatment. \n62. E (46, 52) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75-100 mg/kg \ndaily in divided doses) is effective against pneumonia due \nto Pneumocystis jirovedi (also known as P carinii) infection \nin AIDS patients but may cause rash, fever, and leukopenia. \nAzithromycin can be used as an adjunct in prophylaxis; \nciprofloxacin will only prevent bacterial infections and \nPneumocystis is a fungus; mefloquine is prophylactic against \nmalaria; and penicillin is effective against Trtponema pal\u00ad\nlidum (a spirochaete bacterium). \n63. C (54) The question asks about antimetabolites. The two \noptions in this class are mercaptopurine and fluorouracil. \nMercaptopurine is a purine, affecting purine, not pyrimi\u00ad\ndine, metabolism. The pyrimidine analog 5-FU is a suicide \nsubstrate for thymidylate synthase. \n64. D (16, 59) Ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor \nantagonist, is a highly effective antiernetic. Famotidine \nis an H2 receptor antagonist used for acid-peptic disease. \nLinaclotide is a laxative that stimulates er secretion into \nthe gut lumen, and is used for irritable bowel syndrome \nwith constipation. Mesalamine is a form of 5-aminosalicylic \nacid (5-ASA) used for inflammatory bowel disease, and \nsumatriptan is a serotonin 5-HT !D/lB agonist used for \nmigraine headache."

B (47) A 4-<irug initial regimen would be appropriate in \nthis case, and if the laboratory reports show sensitivity to the \ndrugs, it would be appropriate to discontinue pyrazinamide, \nmaintaining the 3-drug regimen that includes both isoniazid \nand rifampin. Pyrazinamide has a high incidence of adverse \neffects including polyarthralgia as well as hepatic dysfunc\u00ad\ntion, porphyria, and photosensitivity reactions. \n66. A (48) The amphipathic character of amphotericin B \npermits its interaction with ergosterol in fungal cell mem\u00ad\nbranes and results in artificial pores that disrupt membrane \nintegrity. Nystatin, another polyene, acts similarly but is too \nnephrotoxic for systemic use. \n67. A (36, 58) An overdose of aspirin will cause anion gap \nmetabolic acidosis, as described here. Ethanol can also cause \nanion gap acidosis as ethanol metabolism generates NADH, \nleading to conversion of pyruvate to lactate, but the condi\u00ad\ntion is often mild even without treatment. Acetaminophen \ncauses liver failure in overdose, whereas dextromethorphan, \nan opioid, will cause respiratory depression and not hyper\u00ad\nventilation. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, causes \nsedation through its effect on central histamine receptors \nbut does not generally cause acidosis. Dextroamphetamine \nwould cause excitation as it is a centrally acting indirect \nsympathomimetic. Aspirin is the S in the anion gap mne\u00ad\nmonic \"mudpiles\" (Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic Ketoacido\u00ad\nsis, Paraldehyde, Infection, Lactic Acidosis, Ethylene Glycol, \nSalicylates). \n68. D (1, 58) Aspirin is a weak acid with a pKa of 3 .5. Urinary \nalkalinization to a pH of 7.5 or above by administration \nof sodium bicarbonate will enhance urinary excretion of \naspirin and other salicylates. Urinary alkalinization traps the \ncharged, polar form of the salicylates in the renal tubular \nurine. Hemodialysis is also very effective at removing salicy\u00ad\nlates. There is no aspirin antidote. \n69. D (47) Resistance emerges rapidly when rifampin is used as \na single agent in the treatment of bacterial infections. When \nused in the meningococcal carrier state, highly resistant \nstrains may be selected out during treatment. \n70. E (52) Doxycycline, atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), and \nmefloquine are all prophylactic against chloroquine-resistant \nstrains of P fa/ciparum. \n71. H (14) The action potential has a markedly slowed upstroke \nand prolonged duration. These effects, without P or calcium \nblock (characteristic of amiodarone) are characteristic of \ngroup IA drugs, including procainamide. \n72. D (55) Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that \nbinds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-cx). Anti-TNF-cx \nantibody-based drugs (etanercept, adalimumab) are increas\u00ad\ningly used to treat inflammatory disorders such as rheuma\u00ad\ntoid arthritis. Note that abciximah is an antiplatelet agent \nthat targets GPIIb/Illa. \n73. A (30) Adverse effects of the tricyclic antidepressant ami\u00ad\ntriptyline include sedation, hypotension, tachycardia, and \nsymptoms of muscarinic blockade such as decreased bowel \nsounds and pupillary dilation. In severe overdose, watch for \nthe \"3 Cs\" -coma, convulsions, and cardiotoxicity. \n74. B (49) Protease inhibitors such as indinavir act at the post\u00ad\ntranslational step of HIV at which the viral enzyme cleaves \nprecursor molecules to form the final structural proteins of \nthe mature virion core. 75. A (48, 49) Prophylactic drugs used in this AIDS patient \nprovide coverage against most opponunistic infections, \nincluding cytomegalovirus (ganciclovir), hut there is \nno coverage against fungal infections commonly due to \nCandida albicans. \n76. A (42) Paget disease is a condition of too much hone resorp\u00ad\ntion leading to elevated serum calcium. Both the hisphos\u00ad\nphonates {\"dronates\") and calcitonin will lower serum \ncalcium. Calcitonin is the only drug listed for the acute \nlowering of serum calcium. Fluoride and raloxifene affect \nbone formation. PTH and HTZ increase serum calcium. \n77. E (6, 11) Valsartan is a member of the angiotensin receptor\u00ad\nblocking (ARB) group. It is a competitive antagonist of \nangiotensin II at its receptor. \n78. A (11) Amlodipine, as well as diltiazem, nifedipine , and \nverapamil, act as vasodilators by reducing calcium influx via \nL-type channels. Hydralazine and nitroprusside act through \nrelease of nitric oxide. Diazoxide and minoxidil facilitate \npotassium channel opening. \n79. E (25) Trismus, or masseter hypertonia, that results from the \nuse of succinylcholine during induction of anesthesia is a \nrare and dangerous phenomenon. It presents to the anesthe\u00ad\nsiologist the immediate problem of airway management but \nit also must be recognized by the physician as a harbinger of \nmalignant hyperthermia. \n80. C (6) Dinoflagellates secrete saxitoxin, a blocker of voltage\u00ad\ngated Na+ channels in nerves. Exposure to this toxin results \nin block of transmission initially in sensory nerves (causing \nnumbness and tingling) but may extend to block of motor \nnerves with paralysis of voluntary muscle, including the \ndiaphragm. \n81. B (10) Carvedilol is the only p blocker in the list that also \nhas a-blocking action. \n82. C (30) Approximately 5% of women of child-bearing \nage experience symptoms during the late luteal phase of \nthe menstrual cycle that are more serious than PMS. It is \nreferred to as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). \nSSRis, including a long-acting form of fluoxetine given \nweekly, are approved for this indication. \n83. A (30) SSRis are considered first-line treatment of PTSDs \nand can reduce a number of symptoms including anxious \nthoughts and hypervigilance. Psychotherapeutic interven\u00ad\ntions are usually required in addition to antidepressants. \n84. A (31) With the exception of diphenoxylate and loperamide, \nwhich are used for the treatment of diarrhea, constipation is \nconsidered an adverse effect of the opioid analgesics. \n85. B (29) Although all first generation antipsychotic drugs \nblock 02 receptors, some second generation agents are more \npotent inhibitors of 04 dopamine receptors (eg, clozapine) \nor 5-HT 2A serotonin receptors (eg, olanzapine). \n86. D (23, 31, 32) Naltrexone, a nonsdective opioid receptor \nantagonist, is used by individuals recovering from alcohol\u00ad\nuse disorders. \n87. B (43, 44) Ceftriaxone (or cef.txime) is a drug of choice \nfor treatment of gonococcal infections, and chlamydia! \ninfections usually respond to a tetracycline.

Oxandrolone is an \nandrogen used when anabolic action is needed (wasting due \nto illness: cancer, HIY, etc.). \n93. E (55) Cyclosporine exerts its immunosuppressive effect \nby binding to the immunophilin cyclophilin and forming \na complex with the cytoplasmic phosphatase calcineurin, \nwhich is necessary for activation of the T-cell nuclear factor \nof activated T-cell (NF-An transcription factor. As a result, \ncyclosporine inhibits the synthesis of interleukins such as \nIL-2 by activated T cells. \n94. B (36) Etanercept is not appropriate for osteoarthritis \nbecause it binds to and inactivates TNF-a. Thus, it will \nonly be of use in inflammatory disorders that are mediated \nthrough TNF-a such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile\u00ad\nonset arthritis psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing \nspondylitis. Examination 1 557 \n95. J (9) This question and the following one require a com\u00ad\nbined knowledge of agonist and antagonist actions. Note \nthat systolic and diastolic blood pressures are increased, but \nheart rate is decreased by drug 1. This is compatible with a \nstrong a-agonist drug such as norepinephrine (choice H) or \nphenylephrine (choiceJ). The final choice must be withheld \nuntil the actions of drug 2 are evaluated. Following drug 2, \nthere is no change in heart rate, suggesting that the brady\u00ad\ncardia seen previously was a reflex response to the pressor \neffect. Thus, drug 1 lacks !)-agonise effect; it is a \"pure\" a \nagonist. \n96. I (IO) As noted in the answer to the previous question, the \nagonist drug (drug 1) is probably a strong a-agonist sym\u00ad\npathomimetic. Drug 2 markedly reduces the presser action \nof drug I (compatible with ex blockade) and also suppresses \nthe change in heart rate. If drug I was norepinephrine , its \nP-agonist effect on heart rate would have been unmasked. \nThus, drug 2 is a simple a blocker. \n97. B (38) Thyroxine (T4) is preferred over liothyronine (T3) \nbecause it has a longer half-life. It is also less expensive \nand has a slower onset of action. This has the advantage of \navoiding high peak levels that might cause excessive cardiac \nstimulation. T 4 is convened into T 3 in the tissues; thus, the \naffinity for the receptor and the effects on the patient's mood \nwill be the same. \n98. A (37) This patient has signs and symptoms of hyperpro\u00ad\nlactinemia, which is caused by prolactin-secreting pituitary \nadenomas. Dopamine D2 receptor agonists such as bro\u00ad\nmocriptine and cabergoline can be used to suppress the \nexcessive prolactin secretion. \n99. A (40) Clomiphene is a nonsteroidal compound. By selec\u00ad\ntively blocking estrogen receptors in the pituitary, clomi\u00ad\nphene reduces negative feedback and increases FSH and LH \noutput. The increase in gonadotropins stimulates ovulation. \n100. C (41) Metformin carries a black box warning for lactic \nacidosis. Note that metformin is a \"euglycemic agent\" (ie, it \ndoes not cause hypoglycemia)."

The drug most likely to be respon\u00ad\nsible for her condition is \n(A) Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) \n(B) Hashish \n(C) Heroin \n(D) Marijuana \n(E) Methamphetamine \n49. A patient is being intubated and succinylcholine is used for \nmuscle relaxation. Regarding drugs that relax skeletal muscle, \nwhich one of the following statements is accurate? \n(A) Dantrolene is an activator of specific GABA receptors in \nthe spinal cord \n(B) Halothane decreases the action of skeletal muscle \nrdaxants \n(C) Muscle relaxation caused by succinylcholine is exacer\u00ad\nbated by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors \n(D) Sugammadex reverses succinylcholine's effects \n(E) T ubocurarine prevents histamine release via a stabilizing \naction on mast cells \n50. Although fentanyl or one of its congeners is usually admin\u00ad\nistered in the early stages of a general anesthesia procedure, \nit is likely that the patient will receive an injection of mor\u00ad\nphine during the last phase. The rationale for switching to \nmorphine is that the drug has \n(A) A longer duration of action \n(B) Greater analgesic efficacy \n(C) More of a \"ceiling effect\" and less tendency to cause \nrespiratory failure \n(D) Mu (\u00b5) opioid receptor agonist activity, whereas fentanyl \nis a selective kappa (ic) receptor agonist \n(E) The advantage of being more completely reversed by \nnaloxone \n51.

PG\u00a3.i and PGF2a., not PGl2, cause uterine contraction. \nPGI2 synthesis is reduced by NSAIDs, not by histamine. \n3. B (1) The graph shows first-order elimination of the drug \nin question (note ordinate is a log scale). Aspirin, ethanol, \nand phenytoin are eliminated mainly by u:ro-<>rder kinetics. \nDiau:pam is the only drug in the list that is eliminated by \nfirst-order kinetics. \n4. D (2) A membrane-bound ATPase enzyme is part of the \nNa+/K'\" sodium pump. \n5. C (3) During the continuous N infusion of a drug cleared \nby first-order kinetics, the plasma concentration approaches \nsteady state according to the algorithm: 50% at 1 half-life, \n75% at 2, etc. Since the sample was taken at two half-lives, \nthe steady state concentration will be in the range of four\u00ad\nthirds the measured concentration (2.4/0.75) or 3.2 mg/L. \n6. E (1) Before clinical trials can be carried out with a new \ndrug, reproductive toxicity data must be provided for at \nleast 2 species. Chronic toxicity studies in animals are often \ncarried out while clinical trials are underway. \n7. A (56) Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of combustion \nand can accumulate when a stove is used in a closed room, \nparticularly when used longer than overnight. \n8. B (6) Questions that involve the baroreceptor reflex are \ncommon; Figure 6-4 is very high yield. The major responses \nto hypotension are sympathetic discharge (choice B) and \nactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The \ndamp skin associated with sympathetic discharge is due to \nactivation of sweat glands. \n9. C (10, 18) Mannitol is sometimes used to rapidly reduce \nintraocular pressure in acute angle-closure glaucoma. Of the \ndrugs listed, only latanoprost is used in chronic glaucoma. \n10. C (9) The graph shows a marked decrease in diastolic blood \npressure and marked increase in heart rate, with only a \nsmall, transient increase in systolic blood pressure. These \neffects are characteristic of isoproterenol and similar p1, P2 \nagonists. A muscarinic agonist would decrease both systolic \nand diastolic blood pressure. \n11. D (4, 23, 36) Chronic alcohol use induces hepatic cyto\u00ad\nchrome P450 mixed oxidase isozymes. Elevated P450 \nactivity converts more acetaminophen into a toxic interme\u00ad\ndiate, which requires inactivation by glutathione (GSH). \nThis alcohol-induced increase in P450 increases the risk of \nreaching a level of toxic acetaminophen metabolite that can \noverwhelm the liver's detoxification capacity and result in \nsevere hepatotoxicity. \n12. C ( 4) Acetylation, glucuronidation, methylation, and sulfa\u00ad\ntion are phase II conjugation reactions. 13. D (12) Although P blockers may cause long-term changes in \nvascular resistance, the primary action in angina is decreased \ncardiac rate and contractility with resulting decreased car\u00ad\ndiac work. \n14. E (12) Verapamil and diltiau:m are useful for prophylaxis of \nboth effort and vasospastic angina. Calcium blockers reduce \ncardiac work and oxygen demand. They also cause constipa\u00ad\ntion and sometimes peripheral edema that is not associated \nwith heart failure. \n15. B (7) Symptomatic paroxysmal sinus tachycardia often \noccurs in young patients and can sometimes be converted \nto normal sinus rhythm with increased vagal discharge. \nBrief amplification (5-15 min) of the vagal effects on the \nheart can be accomplished with a short-acting cholines\u00ad\nterase inhibitor such as edrophonium. Pyridostigmine (E) \nwould have a much longer action (4---0 h). Adenosine is \noften used in paroxysmal atrio-ventricular tachycardia; it \nhas a duration of 10-15 seconds and acts on adenosine \nreceptors. \n16. B (59) Metoclopramide, a dopamine 02 receptor antago\u00ad\nnist, is a prokinetic drug that can be used to increase gastric \nemptying and intestinal motility in patients with diabetes\u00ad\nassociated gastric paresis. Calcium carbonate is an OTC \nantacid. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog used for \nacid-peptic disease and for medical abortions. Omeprazole \nis a proton pump inhibitor used for acid-peptic disease, and \nondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist used \nas an antiemetic. Metoclopramide is the only prokinetic \ndrug in the list. \n17. D (10) Reflex tachycardia is a major disadvantage of nonse\u00ad\nlective a blockers in the treatment of hypertension because \nthe tachycardia is exaggerated by the CXi blockade of nonse\u00ad\nlective agents. The a.1-sdective blockers are much less likely \nto exaggerate this baroreflex response. \n18. D (11) ACE inhibitors, arteriolar dilators, and P blockers \ndo not ordinarily cause orthostatic hypotension; venodila\u00ad\ntors do. Peripheral a.1 antagonists block sympathetic effects \non both arterioles and veins and thus may cause orthostatic \nhypotension, especially with the first few doses. \n19. E (15) This patient is hyperkalemic and slightly acidotic. \nThese changes are typical of a K'\"-sparing diuretic such as \nspironolactone or eplerenone. \n20. B (11} Of the drugs listed, only donidine, an CXi agonist, \nis associated with severe rebound hypertension if stopped \nsuddenly. It is speculated that this effect is due to down\u00ad\nregulation of CXi receptors. \n21. C (14) The action potential is prolonged without significant \nslowing of the upstroke, so the drug effect is mainly on \npotassium channels (group 3 action, eg, ibutilide) and not \non both sodium and potassium channels (group lA action, \neg, procainamide). \n22. C (24,60} THC acts at both identified cannabinoid recep\u00ad\ntors (CB1, CB2); CBD acts at neither. THC is not FDA\u00ad\napproved for any clinical condition. CBD is FDA-approved \nfor two forms of epilepsy. Medical marijuana, a crude \npreparation, contains a very large number of cannabinoid \nmolecules. \n*Numbers in parentheses are chapters in which more information about answers is found. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

B (15, 42) Loop diuretics decrease calcium absorption \nfrom the urine into blood and can reduce serum calcium, \nwhereas thiazide diuretics decrease calcium excretion from \nthe blood into the urine. None of the other options listed \nhere affects serum calcium. Saline infusion is needed to \nprevent hemoconcentration caused by a strong diuresis. \nOpioids are indicated for acute management of severe \npain due to kidney stones and would be contraindicated \nin coma. \n24. B (15) Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic and acts \non the Na+tcr transporter in the distal convoluted tubule. \nFurosemide acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle \nand inhibits the major transporter in this segment, a Na+/ \nK'\" 12cr transporter. \n25. C ( 17) Substance P is the endogenous peptide closely associ\u00ad\nated with peripheral pain transmission, and capsaicin (the \n\"'hot\" component from hot peppers) is an antagonist. \n26. E (18) The cyclooxygenase enzymes are responsible for \ncyclizing arachidonate to prostaglandin precursors. \n27. A (20) Albuterol, metaproterenol, and terbutaline are rapid\u00ad\nonset, selective P2 agonists used as first-line therapy for acute \nasthma. \n28. C (20) Salmeterol and formoterol are slow-onset, long\u00ad\nacting, selective ~2 agonists usually used by inhalation with \ncorticosteroids in asthma prophylaxis. Indacaterol and \nvilanterol are similar but approved only for COPD. \n29. E (26) In overdose, intravenous lidocaine causes typical local \nanesthetic toxicity including CNS stimulation with possible \nseizures. Cardiovascular depression may occur, but it is usu\u00ad\nally minor. \n30. B (25, 27) Malignant hyperthermia is a rare disorder char\u00ad\nacterized by massive calcium release within skeletal muscle \ntriggered by use of succinylcholine in anesthesia protocols . \nDantrolene is given to block calcium release. \n31. C (34) Deep vein thromboses are less responsive to the \nantiplatelet agents {aspirin, dopidogrel). Warfarin is tera\u00ad\ntogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Bivalirudin \nis a thrombin inhibitor that can be used parenterally only. \nEnoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin, is the \ndrug of choice to treat and prevent deep vein thromboses \nand is safe to use during pregnancy. \n32. E (48) Amphotericin B and caspofungin are active against \nmany systemic fungal infections, but they interfere with \nfungal cell wall functions. Voriconazole, an azole antifungal \nlike fluconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole, inter\u00ad\nferes with cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting ergosterol \nsynthesis. \n33. C (49) Acyclovir is a guanosine analog activated by viral \nthymidine kinases of HSY and V'ZV to form acyclovir \ntriphosphate, a competitive substrate for DNA polymerase; \nit results in chain termination when incorporated into viral \nDNA. \n34. B (53) Mebendazole is the primary drug for treatment of \npinworm, roundworm, and whipworm infections. The drug \nis contraindicated in pregnancy. Mebendazole and thiaben\u00ad\ndazole (a more toxic azole) are inhibitors of microtubule \nsynthesis in nematodes. \n35. D (52) These dose-related symptoms are characteristic \nadverse effects of the alkaloids (cg, quinine, quinidinc) \nderived from the bark of the cinchona tree and are termed \ncinchonism. Examination 2 569 \n36. B (41) Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor that increases glu\u00ad\ncose excretion by the kidney. Acarbose inhibits polyi;accha\u00ad\nride breakdown. Exenatide is a GLP analog. Repaglinide is \nan insulin secretagogue and rosiglitazone is a PPAR-garnma \nagonist that enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity and is \nassociated with increased risk of hean failure. \n37. C (55) Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant \nwhose active metabolite inhibits de nova production of gua\u00ad\nnosine nucleotides. Lymphocytes are particularly sensitive to \nthe antimetabolite effect of mycophenolate mofetil because \nthey lack the alternative salvage pathway for guanosine syn\u00ad\nthesis that is present in most cells. \n38. E (47) Mutations in the katG gene result in the underpro\u00ad\nduction of mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase, an enzyme \nthat bioactivates INH, facilitating its interaction with its \ntarget ketoacyl carrier protein synthetase. The result is high\u00ad\nlevel resistance to INH. Mutations in the inhA gene result \nin low-level resistance with cross-resistance to pyrazinamide. \n39. B (57, 58) Deferoxamine, a chdator with high selectivity \nand affinity for iron, is used intravenously for acute iron \npoisoning. Activated charcoal does not bind iron . .Acetyl\u00ad\ncyi;teine is used fur acetaminophen poisoning. Pralidoxime \nis used fur organophosphate poisoning. Intravenous EDTA \nis used for lead poisoning; oral EDTA does not significantly \nreduce iron absorption after an oral iron overdose. \n40. D (9, 20) Albuterol and metaproterenol are ~-selective bron\u00ad\nchodilators used in asthma and may cause undesirable cardiac \nstimulation in COPD patients. Metoprolol is a P blocker and \nwould precipitate bronchospasm. Verapamil blocks calcium \nchannels but has little useful effect in bronchospasm. Tiotro\u00ad\npium and ipratropium are long-acting muscarinic antagonists \nadministered by inhalation and have a useful bronchodilator \neffect in COPD with little systemic effect. \n41. C (11, 15) Spironolactone inhibits potassium excretion in the \nkidney by blocking aldosterone. Captopril reduces angiotensin \nII levels and secondarily reduces aldosterone. The combination \nmay increase serum potassium to dangerous levels. \n42. D (21, 28) Antagonism at dopamine D2 receptors in the \nCNS is equated with parkinsonian symptoms (Drugs A and \nD). However, in the case of Drug A, this action would be \noffset by its ability to block muscarinic receptors. M block\u00ad\ners, eg, benztropine, improve tremor and rigidity in parkin\u00ad\nsonism but have little effect on bradykinesia. \n43. B (22, 29) Clonaz.epam, a benwdiazepine, is effi:ctive in the \nmanagement of absence seizures and is also used in the treatment \nof bipolar disorder. Alprawlarn is useful in anxiety; domip\u00ad\nramine and SSRis are useful in obsessive-compulsive disorder. \n44. A (23) Fomepizole, an antidote for ethylene glycol and \nmethanol poisoning, inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, which \nconverts ethylene glycol and methanol to toxic metabolites. \n45. B (24} Simple focal seizures can have the characteristics of \nthe \"jacksonian march.\" Many drugs are used in its manage\u00ad\nment including those listed, with the exception of ethosuxi\u00ad\nmide, which is useful in absence seizures but not effective \nin partial seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizure states. \n46. E (24) Myoclonic seizure syndromes are usually treated \nwith valproic acid. Neural tube defects (spma bifida) are \nassociated with the use of valproic acid during pregnancy. \nLamotrigine is approved for adjunctive use but is often \nused as a sole agent, and several backup drugs are available \nincluding topiramate and zonisarnide."

E (26} Local anesthetics block voltage-dependent sodium \nchannels in excitable tissues including nerves and muscle, \ndecreasing action-potential conduction. Rapidly firing fibers \narc more sensitive than slowly firing nerve fibers. Cocaine \nhas this action and also blocks the reuptakc of norcpineph\u00ad\nrinc at sympathetic neuroeffcctor junctions with effects on \nboth the heart and the CNS. \n48. E (32) The signs and symptoms arc those of high-dose \nabuse of dextroamphctaminc or methamphctamine. There \nis no specific antidote, and supportive measures are directed \ntoward protection against cardiac arrhythmias and seizures \nand control of body temperature. \n49. C (27} Dantrolene blocks the release of calcium from skel\u00ad\netal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, halothane enhances \nskeletal muscle relaxants, and sugammadex reverses block\u00ad\nade induced by rocuronium and vecuronium. Acetylcholin\u00ad\nesterase inhibitors do not reverse skeletal muscle relaxation \ncaused by succinylcholine. \n50. A (31} Fentanyl is much shorter acting than morphine. Both \ndrugs arc \u00b5-receptor activators, equally effective in terms of \nanalgesic activity and reversible by naloxone. Both drugs \ncause respiratory depression at high doses. \n51. C (23} Intellectual disability, microcephaly, and facial dys\u00ad\nmorphia are characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome, caused \nby excessive use of ethanol during pregnancy. \n52. C (9, 30, 62) Selegiline is an MAO-B inhibitor and \nincreases the amount of catecholamine transmitter stored \nin sympathetic nerve endings. When an indirectly act\u00ad\ning sympathomimetic such as tyramine (found in some \nfoods) avoids first-pass metabolism (due to MAO inhibi\u00ad\ntion} and reaches the nerve endings, it can release large \namounts of norepinephrine and cause a hypertensive \ncrisis. \n53. D (27} In phase I block, the action of succinylcholine is \nnot reversed by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The drug is \nmetabolized by pseudocholinesterases. It may cause hista\u00ad\nmine release, and it can cause hypcrkalcmia. \n54. C (7, 8, 27} The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostig\u00ad\nmine can reverse skeletal muscle relaxation {caused by \nvecuronium) but may also cause bradycardia, a muscarinic \neffect. The later effect can be prevented by use of glycopyr\u00ad\nrolate, which has muscarinic receptor-blocking action. \n55. E (29} Significant weight gain and hyperglycemia due to \na diabetogenic action occur with several atypical antipsy\u00ad\nchotics, especially clozapine (not listed} and olanzapine. \nNeurologic dysfunctions arc less common with the atypi\u00ad\ncal agents. \n56. E (30, 31) Naloxone is an opioid \u00b5-receptor antagonist and \nwill oppose the actions of opioids at this class of receptors \nincluding analgesia, miosis, and symptoms of opioid over\u00ad\ndose including respiratory depression. However, respiratory \ndepression due to nefazodone, a 5-HT 2A antagonist, is not \nexerted via the \u00b5-opioid receptor. \n57. C (28} Entacaponc is a catechol-0-mcthyltransferasc inhibi\u00ad\ntor that enhances the action of levodopa by preventing its \nmetabolism in the blood and peripheral tissues. It does not \ncross the blood-brain barrier and if used alone will not ame\u00ad\nliorate symptoms of Parkinson disease. \n58. B (22) The hypnotic action of rameltcon is thought to be \ndue to its activation of melatonin receptors in the suprachi\u00ad\nasmatic nuclei of the CNS. 59. A (43, 46} The drugs of choice for treatment of gonorrhea \ncurrently are the cephalosporins ceftriaxonc and cefixime. \nAzithromycin and spectinomycin are alternatives. Cipro\u00ad\nfloxacin has been withdrawn from international guidelines \nbut may occasionally be used. The CDC currently recom\u00ad\nmends a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone with oral \nazithromycin. Resistance to amoxicillin is common. \n60. A (44} The only drug likely to be effective in nongonococ\u00ad\ncal urethritis in a single dose is azithromycin, which has an \nelimination half-life of several days. Other drugs used in \nnongonococcal urethritis include clindamycin, ofloxacin, \nand the tetracyclines. \n61. B (45) The aminoglycoside antibiotics are bactericidal \ninhibitors of protein synthesis. Recall that their actions con\u00ad\ntinue well beyond their short half-lives because they exert a \npostantibiotic action. \n62. D (44} Tetracycline use during pregnancy is discouraged \nsince fetal exposure to these antibiotics may ultimately lead \nto irregularities in bone growth and dentition. In addition, \ngastrointestinal effects and the potential for hepatic dysfunc\u00ad\ntion are increased in the pregnant patient. \n63. B (39) Long-term use of prednisone has several side effects \nsuch as growth inhibition, diabetes, muscle wasting, and \nosteoporosis. Regarding the other options: Excess steroid \nuse results in baldness. Corticosteroids (such as predni\u00ad\nsone) can be used to treat some hemolytic anemias. Choice \nD is incorrect because it describes congenital adrenal \nhyperplasia, a condition in which the adrenal gland fails \nto make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Treatment \nwould be to provide these hormones to restore physiologi\u00ad\ncal levels. \n64. B (42} The bisphosphonates can cause esophageal irritation, \nwhich is managed by drinking fluids and staying upright for \n30 min after taking the drug. Blue skin is an adverse effect \nof amiodarone. Color vision can be affected by anti-TB \ntreatment. Priapism can be caused by sildenafil in combi\u00ad\nnation with nitrates, and tendinitis is an adverse effect of \nfluoroquinolones. \n65. C (44, 47) Azithromycin (not listed) or clarithromycin \nwith or without rifabutin is recommended for primary pro\u00ad\nphylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in \npatients with AIDS. \n66. E (49) Efavirenz is used in highly active antiretroviral \ntherapy (HAART) regimens against HIY. The drug is a non\u00ad\nnucleoside allosteric inhibitor of HN reverse transcriptase \n(NNRTI) and docs not bind to the active site of the enzyme. \n67. B (43, 44, 46) In a community-acquired pneumonia, the \nwider spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone would cover typi\u00ad\ncal organisms, and erythromycin would be active against the \natypical organisms. \n68. E (43, 44, 46} Single antimicrobial drug therapy would he \ninadequate coverage in a hospital-acquired pneumonia that \ncould include possible infection due to multidrug-resistant \nstaphylococci as well as gram-negative bacilli such as Pseu\u00ad\ndomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin should cover gram-positive \norganisms, and piperacillin plus the penicillinase inhibitor \nwould be active against most strains of likely gram-negative \npathogens. \n69. B (49) Many resistant strains of HSY commonly lack \nthymidine kinase, the enzyme involved in the viral-specific \nactivation of acyclovir by phosphorylation. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"

E (54) Bleomycin is one of the 4 drugs for which myelosup\u00ad\npression is not dose-limiting. The 3 others are cisplatin for \nnephrotoxicity, doxorubicin for cardiotoxicity, and vincris\u00ad\ntine for peripheral neuropathy. \n72. C (54) The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (one of the 4 drugs \nwith unique dose-limiting toxicity; see Question 71) can be \nmitigated by dexrazoxane. \n73. D (37) The posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin contracts \nuterine smooth muscle. It is used to augment labor and, in \nthis case, to treat postpartum uterine atony. \n74. C (40) Progestins act on the endometrium, where estrogen \nagonists can induce proliferation and increase the risk of \nendometrial cancer. Progestins have been shown to reduce \nthis risk. Progestin toxicity includes increased blood pressure \nand a decrease in HDL. Long-term use of progestins can \nlead to a reduction in bone density. \n75. D (16) Diphenhydramine is a first-generation anti-H1 \nblocker with significant anti-motion sickness and sedative \nactions. Loratadine is a second-generation antihistamine \nwith neither of these effects. Neither drug is effective in \nasthma or GERD, and neither blocks drug-metabolizing \nenzymes. \n76. A (13) While therapeutic strategies in chronic heart failure \ninclude use of several different drug classes including diuret\u00ad\nics and positive inotropic agents, 4 drugs or drug groups \nhave been shown to provide survival benefits: ACE inhibi\u00ad\ntors, certain J3 blockers including carvedilol, the aldosterone \nantagonists spironolactone and eplerenone, and sacubitril/ \nvalsartan. \n77. D (38) Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are small \nsulfur-containing thioamides that inhibit thyroid hormone \nsynthesis by blocking peroxidase catalyzed reactions, iodin\u00ad\nation of thyroglobulin, and coupling of DIT and MIT (see \nFigure 38-1). Dexamethasone is an orally active cortico\u00ad\nsteroid, lithium is a mood stabilizer, and propranolol is a P blocker capable of inhibiting the peripheral conversion of \nT4 to T3\u2022 \n78. E (31) Meperidine is a strong opioid agonist with analgesic \nefficacy equivalent to that of morphine. The drug has a \nmuscarinic blocking action and does not cause miosis or \ncontraction of biliary smooth muscle. With long-term use, \nits metabolite normeperidine accumulates and may cause \nseizures. \n79. C (35) The patient has elevated triglycerides. Fibrates \nare the main triglyceride-lowering drugs, acting through \nPPAR-alpha activation. Fibrates also increase HDL. \nCholestyramine, ezetimibe, and lovastatin mainly lower \nLDL cholesterol, whereas pioglitazone is an antidiabetic \ndrug that increases insulin sensitivity through PPAR-r \nactivation. \n80. D (34) Heparin is negatively charged and will be effectively \ncomplexed with the positively charged protamine. There \nis no antidote for options A and B. Rivaroxaban can be \nreversed with andexanet alfa. If the effect of warfarin is too \ngreat, vitamin K1 supplements or parenteral phytonadione \n(vitamin K1) can be added in addition to dose reduction. \nFor urgent reversal of anticoagulation by any drug, fresh \nfrozen plasma may be used. Examination 2 571 \n81. A (35) Resins increase triglycerides (TGs), particularly \nin patients who are genetically predisposed to high TGs. \nEzetimibe has no effect on TGs, but fibrates and niacin both \nlower TGs and pravastatin mostly lowers LDL cholesterol. \n82. D (40) Combination hormonal contraceptives have clinical \nuses and beneficial effects in treatment of acne, hirsutism, \nand dysmenorrhea. In addition, with long-term use, they \nhave been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian and endome\u00ad\ntrial cancer. \n83. E (34) Warfarin interferes with gamma carboxylation of \nclotting f.tctors IX, X, VII, and II, and the anticlotting f.tc\u00ad\ntors protein C and protein S. Dabigatran, an oral thrombin \ninhibitor, carries the risk of bleeding and not thrombosis. \nAspirin can cause gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. \nHeparin is the only drug on this list that can also cause \nthrombosis, but in the case of heparin, it is mediated not \nthrough protein C but rather through an immunologic reac\u00ad\ntion against heparin-platelet complexes. \n84. D (59) Mesalamine is a form of 5-aminosalicylic acid \n(5-ASA) used as first-line treatment for inflammatory bowel \ndisease (IBD). Aspirin is a salicylate but this makes IBD \nworse and is contraindicated. Linaclotide is a laxative, acting \nthrough cGMP to increase chloride secretion. Misoprostol \n(a prostaglandin) and ranitidine (H2 receptor blocker) are \nused for acid-peptic disease. \n85. D (24) A number of antiseizure drugs cause serious tox\u00ad\nicities, including hepatotoxicity with both valproic acid and \nfdbamate. In the case of lamotrigine, which has been com\u00ad\nmonly used in myoclonic seizures, toxic epidermal necroly\u00ad\nsis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) has occurred. \n86. B (30) The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class \nof antidepressants has been shown to have therapeutic value \nin a wide range of psychiatric dysfunctions ranging from \nbulimia to obsessive-compulsive disorder. One of the adverse \neffects of SSRis is diminished sexual function and interest. \n87. B (14) Adenosine is favored for the prompt conversion of \natrioventricular nodal rhythms to normal sinus rhythm. \nGroup 1 a drugs such as quinidine and procainamide are \nassociated with increased risk of torsades. Amiodarone, \na broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic, has the best record of \nreducing this risk. \n88. D (28) Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist with \nhigh affinity for the D3 receptor. It is used as monotherapy \nin mild parkinsonism and together with levodopa in more \nadvanced disease. Mental disturbances such as confusion, \ndelusions, and impulsivity are more common with prami\u00ad\npexole than with levodopa. \n89. D (33, 58) In cyanide poisoning, the vitamin B12 analog \nhydroxocobalamin reacts with cyanide to form cyanocobala\u00ad\nmin, another form of B12 that is stored in the liver. Vitamin \nK is an antidote for excess warfarin anticoagulation, metha\u00ad\nnol is never an antidote-rather ethanol is the antidote for \nmethanol poisoning when fomepizole is not available, dobu\u00ad\ntamine is a p1 agonist, and flumazenil reverses the effect of \nbenzodiazepines. \n90. A (54) Cyclophosphamide is converted into acrolein, which \ndamages the kidney. Mesna can bind to and detoxify acrolein. \nNote that the dose-limiting toxicity of cyclophosphamide is \nbone marrow suppression. Note also that leucovorin is not an \nanticancer agent and is used as folate rescue after high dose \nmethotrexate or together with 5-FU to enhance its effects."

            "Text": "572 APPENDIX IV \n91. A (54, 55) Allopurinol interferes with the metabolism of \nazathioprine, increasing plasma levels of 6-mercaptopurine, \nwhich may result in potentially fatal blood dyscrasias. Con\u00ad\ncomitant use of allopurinol requires the dose of azathioprine \nto be reduced by 75%. \n92. B (36) Treatment of gout falls into 2 categories: (1) to \ntreat the acute attack, in which the goal is to reduce pain \nand inflammation, and (2) to prevent attacks by reducing \nthe uric acid pool through inhibition of uric acid buildup \n(allopurinol and febuxostat) or by enhanced elimination \n(probenecid). Indomethacin is an NSAID that can reduce \npain and inflammation. Mesalamine reduces inflammation \nin IBO, and methotrexate is more effective for immuno\u00ad\ninflammatory disorders. \n93. C (33) Deficiencies of folic acid or vitamin B12 are the most \ncommon causes of megaloblastic anemia. If a patient with this \ntype of anemia has a normal serum vitamin B12 concentra\u00ad\ntion, folate deficiency is the most likely cause of the anemia. \nDeficiency of fulic acid during early pregnancy is associated \nwith increased risk of a neural tube defect in the newborn. In \nthe United States, cereals and grains are supplemented with \nfolic acid in an effort to decrease the incidence of folic acid \ndeficiency. \n94. B (37) This woman's central diabetes insipidus is due to \ninsufficient posterior pituitary production of vasopressin. \nDesmopressin, a selective vasopressin V2 receptor agonist, \ncan be administered orally, nasally, or parenterally to treat \ncentral diabetes insipidus. Bromocriptine is a dopamine 02 \nreceptor agonist used to inhibit prolactin release; octreotide \nis a somatostatin receptor agonist, used to stop bleeding and \ntreat acromcgaly and several other hormone-secreting tumors; \nprednisone is a corticosteroid used as an immunosuppressant; \nsomatropin, the recombinant form of human GH, is used for \nGH deficiency in children and adults and in the treatment of \nchildren with genetic diseases associated with short stature. \n95. D (37, 38) RAI is effective for radiation-induced destruction \nof thyroid parenchyma. T3 and T4 are thyroid preparations \nused in hypothyroidism; leuprolide is a gonadotropin-rclcasing \nhormone (GnRH) analog. In men and women, steady \n(non-pulsatile) dosing with these GnRH agonists inhibits \ngonadotropin release by downregulating GnRH receptors \nin the pituitary cells that normally release gonadotropins. 96. A (40, 54) Anastrozole prevents conversion of testosterone \nto estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is an orally available form of \nestradiol. Finasteride is a 5-<X-reductase inhibitor. Spirono\u00ad\nlactone is an androgen receptor antagonist (used mainly \nas a K-sparing diuretic and also in feminizing hormone \ntherapy), and tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor \nmodulator. \n97. C (41) Glipizide is the only agent in this list that directly \nstimulates insulin secretion, potentially leading to hypo\u00ad\nglycemia, especially if the patient takes the medication \nregularly, without having access to food. Empagliflozin is \nan SGLT2 inhibitor reducing renal glucose reabsorption. \nAcarbose and miglitol inhibit polysaccharide breakdown. \nMetfurmin acts in the liver. Rosiglitazone is a PPAR-y acti\u00ad\nvator and may be a good choice in this setting. \n98. A (34) Deep vein thromboses tend to be fibrin-rich and \nplatelet-poor, making them less responsive to the antiplate\u00ad\nlet agents (abciximab, clopidogrel). Un&actionated heparin \ncarries the risk of triggering more heparin-induced throm\u00ad\nbocytopenia. Warfarin will take several days to achieve a \ntherapeutic effect. Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor) is \nthe drug of choice for fast anticoagulation in patients with \nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia. \n99. G (9, 10) See answers to questions 95 and 96 in Examina\u00ad\ntion 1 (Appendix III). Drug 1 evokes a strong pressor effect \nand a bradycardia that is probably a reflex compensatory \nresponse. Thus, both norepinephrine and phenylephrine are \npossible answers. However, the action of Drug 2 unmasks a \ntachycardia (a p adrenoccptor effect) produced by Drug 1, \nso this agonist must be norepinephrinc; phcnylephrine docs \nnot have P agonist action. \n100. H (IO) See answers to the preceding question and toques\u00ad\ntions 95 and 96 in Examination 1. Drug 2 is an a blocker \nwithout P-blocking action. \nALGRAWANY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2202763316616203"
