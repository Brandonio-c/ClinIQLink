            "Text": "The Body\n2are studied at the same time. For example, if  the thorax \nis to be studied, all of  its structures are examined.  \nThis includes the vasculature, the nerves, the bones,  \nthe muscles, and all other structures and organs  \nlocated in the region of  the body defined as the  \nthorax. After studying this region, the other regions of  the body (i.e., the abdomen, pelvis, lower limb, upper limb, back, head, and neck) are studied in a similar fashion.\n\u25a0 In contr ast, in a systemic approach, each system of  \nthe body is studied and followed throughout the entire body . For example, a study of  the cardiovascular system looks at the heart and all of  the blood vessels in the body . When this is completed, the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and all the nerves) might be examined in detail. This approach continues for the whole body until every system, including the nervous, skeletal, muscular, gastrointestinal, respiratory , lymphatic, and reproduc-tive systems, has been studied.\nEach of  these approaches has benefits and deficiencies. \nThe regional approach works very well if  the anatomy \ncourse involves cadaver dissection but falls short when  \nit comes to understanding the continuity of  an entire system throughout the body . Similarly , the systemic approach fosters an understanding of  an entire system throughout the body , but it is very difficult to coordinate this directly with a cadaver dissection or to acquire suffi -\ncient detail.\nImportant anatomical terms\nThe anatomical position\nThe anatomical position is the standard reference position of  the body used to describe the location of  structures (Fig. 1.1). The body is in the anatomical position when standing upright with feet together, hands by the side and face looking forward. The mouth is closed and the facial expres -\nsion is neutral. The rim of  bone under the eyes is in the same horizontal plane as the top of  the opening to the  \near, and the eyes are open and focused on something in  \nthe distance. The palms of  the hands face forward with the fingers straight and together and with the pad of  the thumb turned 90\u00b0 to the pads of  the fingers. The toes point forward.\nAnatomical planes\nThree major groups of  planes pass through the body in the anatomical position (Fig. 1.1).What is anatomy?\nAnatomy includes those structures that can be seen grossly (without the aid of  magnification) and microscopically (with the aid of  magnification). Typically , when used by itself, the term anatomy tends to mean gross or macroscopic \nanatomy\u2014that is, the study of  structures that can be seen without using a microscopic. Microscopic anatomy , also called histology , is the study of  cells and tissues using a microscope.\nAnatomy forms the basis for the practice of  medicine. \nAnatomy leads the physician toward an understanding of  a patient\u2019s disease, whether he or she is carrying out a physical examination or using the most advanced imaging techniques. Anatomy is also important for dentists, chiro-practors, physical therapists, and all others involved in any aspect of  patient treatment that begins with an analysis of  clinical signs. The ability to interpret a clinical observation correctly is therefore the endpoint of  a sound anatomical  \nunderstanding.\nObservation and visualization are the primary tech -\nniques a student should use to learn anatomy . Anatomy is much more than just memorization of  lists of  names. Although the language of  anatomy is important, the network of  information needed to visualize the position of  physical structures in a patient goes far beyond simple memorization. Knowing the names of  the various branches of  the external carotid artery is not the same as being able to visualize the course of  the lingual artery from its origin in the neck to its termination in the tongue. Similarly , understanding the organization of  the soft palate, how it is related to the oral and nasal cavities, and how it moves during swallowing is very different from being able to recite the names of  its individual muscles and nerves. An under -\nstanding of  anatomy requires an understanding of  the context in which the terminology can be remembered.\nHow can gross anatomy be studied?\nThe term anatomy is derived from the Greek word temnein, \nmeaning \u201cto cut.\u201d Clearly , therefore, the study of  anatomy is linked, at its root, to dissection, although dissection of  cadavers by students is now augmented, or even in some cases replaced, by viewing prosected (previously dissected) material and plastic models, or using computer teaching modules and other learning aids.\nAnatomy can be studied following either a regional or a \nsystemic approach.\n\u25a0 W ith a regional approach, each region of  the body  \nis studied separately and all aspects of  that region"

            "Text": "The Body\n4\u25a0 Proximal and distal are used with reference to being \ncloser to or farther from a structure\u2019s origin, particu -\nlarly in the limbs. For example, the hand is distal to the  \nelbow joint. The glenohumeral joint is proximal to the elbow joint. These terms are also used to describe  \nthe relative positions of  branches along the course of  linear structures, such as airways, vessels, and nerves. For example, distal branches occur farther away toward the ends of  the system, whereas proximal branches occur closer to and toward the origin of  the system.\n\u25a0 Cranial (toward the head) and caudal (toward the tail) \nare sometimes used instead of  superior and inferior, respectively .\n\u25a0 Rostral is used, particularly in the head, to describe the position of  a structure with reference to the nose. For example, the forebrain is rostral to the hindbrain.\nSuperficial and deep\nTwo other terms used to describe the position of  structures in the body are superficial and deep. These terms are used to describe the relative positions of  two structures with respect to the surface of  the body . For example, the sternum is superficial to the heart, and the stomach is deep to the abdominal wall.\nSuperficial and deep can also be used in a more absolute \nfashion to define two major regions of  the body . The super -\nficial region of  the body is external to the outer layer of  deep fascia. Deep structures are enclosed by this layer. Structures in the superficial region of  the body include the skin, superficial fascia, and mammary glands. Deep struc-tures include most skeletal muscles and viscera. Superficial \nwounds are external to the outer layer of  deep fascia, whereas deep wounds penetrate through it.\u25a0 Coronal planes are oriented vertically and divide the body into anterior and posterior parts.\n\u25a0 Sagittal planes also are oriented vertically but are at right angles to the coronal planes and divide the body into right and left parts. The plane that passes through the center of  the body dividing it into equal right and left halves is termed the median sagittal plane .\n\u25a0 Transverse, horizontal, or axial planes divide the body into superior and inferior parts.\nTerms to describe location\nAnterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal),  \nmedial and lateral, superior and inferior\nThree major pairs of  terms are used to describe the location of  structures relative to the body as a whole or to other structures (Fig. 1.1).\n\u25a0 Anterior (or ventral) and posterior (or dorsal) \ndescribe the position of  structures relative to the \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d of  the body . For example, the nose is an anterior (ventral) structure, whereas the vertebral column is a posterior (dorsal) structure. Also, the nose is anterior to the ears and the vertebral column is pos -\nterior to the sternum.\n\u25a0 Medial and lateral describe the position of  structures relative to the median sagittal plane and the sides of   \nthe body . For example, the thumb is lateral to the little finger. The nose is in the median sagittal plane and is medial to the eyes, which are in turn medial to the external ears.\n\u25a0 Superior and inferior describe structures in reference \nto the vertical axis of  the body . For example, the head is superior to the shoulders and the knee joint is inferior to the hip joint.\nProximal and distal, cranial and caudal,  \nand rostral\nOther terms used to describe positions include proximal and distal, cranial and caudal, and rostral."

Focusing cup Glass X-ray tube\nX-raysAnodeTungsten target Tungsten filament\nCathodeImaging\nDiagnostic imaging techniques\nIn 1895 Wilhelm Roentgen used the X-rays from a cathode \nray tube to expose a photographic plate and produce the first radiographic exposure of  his wife\u2019s hand. Over the past 35 years there has been a revolution in body imaging, which has been paralleled by developments in computer technology .\nPlain radiography\nX-rays are photons (a type of  electromagnetic radiation) and are generated from a complex X-ray tube, which is a type of  cathode ray tube (Fig. 1.2). The X-rays are then collimated (i.e., directed through lead-lined shutters to stop them from fanning out) to the appropriate area of  the body . As the X-rays pass through the body they are attenuated (reduced in energy) by the tissues. Those X-rays that pass through the tissues interact with the photographic film.\nIn the body:\n\u25a0 air a ttenuates X-rays a little;\n\u25a0 f at attenuates X-rays more than air but less than  \nwater; and\n\u25a0 bone a ttenuates X-rays the most.\nThese differences in attenuation result in differences in \nthe level of  exposure of  the film. When the photographic film is developed, bone appears white on the film because this region of  the film has been exposed to the least amount of  X-rays. Air appears dark on the film because these regions were exposed to the greatest number of  X-rays.\nModifications to this X-ray technique allow a continu -\nous stream of  X-rays to be produced from the X-ray tube and collected on an input screen to allow real-time visual-ization of  moving anatomical structures, barium studies, angiography , and fluoroscopy (Fig. 1.3).\nFig. 1.3  Fl uoroscopy unit."

It is, however, extremely important that these substances are nontoxic. Barium sulfate, an insoluble salt, is a nontoxic, relatively high-density agent that is extremely useful in the examination of  the gastro -\nintestinal tract. When a barium sulfate suspension  is \ningested it attenuates X-rays and can therefore be used to demonstrate the bowel lumen (Fig. 1.4). It is common to add air to the barium sulfate suspension, by either ingest-ing \u201cfizzy\u201d granules or directly instilling air into the body cavity , as in a barium enema. This is known as a double-contrast (air/barium) study .\nFor some patients it is necessary to inject contrast agents \ndirectly into arteries or veins. In this case, iodine-based molecules are suitable contrast agents. Iodine is chosen \nbecause it has a relatively high atomic mass and so mark -\nedly attenuates X-rays, but also, importantly , it is naturally excreted via the urinary system. Intra-arterial and intrave -\nnous contrast agents are extremely safe and are well toler -\nated by most patients. Rarely , some patients have an anaphylactic reaction to intra-arterial or intravenous injections, so the necessary precautions must be taken. Intra-arterial and intravenous contrast agents not only help in visualizing the arteries and veins but because they are excreted by the urinary system, can also be used to visualize the kidneys, ureter, and bladder in a process known as intravenous urography.\nSubtraction angiography\nDuring angiography it is often difficult to appreciate the contrast agent in the vessels through the overlying bony structures. To circumvent this, the technique of  subtrac-tion angiography has been developed. Simply , one or  \ntwo images are obtained before the injection of  contrast media. These images are inverted (such that a negative is created from the positive image). After injection of  the contrast media into the vessels, a further series of  images are obtained, demonstrating the passage of  the contrast through the arteries into the veins and around the circula -\ntion. By adding the \u201cnegative precontrast image\u201d to the positive postcontrast images, the bones and soft tissues  \nare subtracted to produce a solitary image of  contrast  \nonly . Before the advent of  digital imaging this was a  \nchallenge, but now the use of  computers has made this technique relatively straightforward and instantaneous (Fig. 1.5)."

Sound waves bounce off  moving structures and are returned. The degree of  frequency shift determines whether the object is moving away from or toward the probe and the speed at which it is traveling. Precise measurements of  blood flow and blood velocity can therefore be obtained, which in turn can indicate sites of  blockage in blood vessels.\nComputed tomography\nComputed tomography (CT) was invented in the 1970s by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979. Since this inspired invention there have been many generations of  CT scanners.\nA CT scanner obtains a series of  images of  the body \n(slices) in the axial plane. The patient lies on a bed, an X-ray tube passes around the body (Fig. 1.7), and a series of  images are obtained. A computer carries out a complex mathematical transformation on the multitude of  images to produce the final image (Fig. 1.8).\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nNuclear magnetic resonance imaging was first described in 1946 and used to determine the structure of  complex Ultrasound\nUltrasonography of  the body is widely used for all aspects of  medicine.\nUltrasound is a very high frequency sound wave  \n(not electromagnetic radiation) generated by piezoelectric materials, such that a series of  sound waves is produced. Importantly , the piezoelectric material can also receive the sound waves that bounce back from the internal organs. The sound waves are then interpreted by a powerful  \ncomputer, and a real-time image is produced on the  \ndisplay panel.\nDevelopments in ultrasound technology , including the \nsize of  the probes and the frequency range, mean that a broad range of  areas can now be scanned.\nTraditionally ultrasound is used for assessing the \nabdomen (Fig. 1.6) and the fetus in pregnant women. Ultrasound is also widely used to assess the eyes, neck, soft tissues, and peripheral musculoskeletal system. Probes have been placed on endoscopes, and endoluminal ultra -\nsound of  the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum is now routine. Endocavity ultrasound is carried out most com-monly to assess the genital tract in women using a  \ntransvaginal or transrectal route. In men, transrectal ultrasound is the imaging method of  choice to assess the prostate in those with suspected prostate hypertrophy or malignancy .\nFig. 1.6  Ultrasound e xamination of the abdomen. \n Fig. 1.7  C omputed tomography scanner."

The process of  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is dependent on the free protons in the hydrogen nuclei in molecules of  water (H\n2O). Because water is \npresent in almost all biological tissues, the hydrogen proton is ideal. The protons within a patient\u2019s hydrogen nuclei can be regarded as small bar magnets, which are randomly oriented in space. The patient is placed in a strong magnetic field, which aligns the bar magnets. When a pulse of  radio waves is passed through the patient the magnets are deflected, and as they return to their aligned position they emit small radio pulses. The strength and frequency of  the emitted pulses and the time it takes for the protons to return to their pre-excited state produce a signal. These signals are analyzed by a powerful computer, and an image is created (Fig. 1.9).\nBy altering the sequence of  pulses to which the protons \nare subjected, different properties of  the protons can be assessed. These properties are referred to as the \u201cweight-ing\u201d of  the scan. By altering the pulse sequence and the scanning parameters, T1-weighted images (Fig. 1.10A) and T2-weighted images (Fig. 1.10B) can be obtained. These two types of  imaging sequences provide differences in image contrast, which accentuate and optimize different tissue characteristics.\nFrom the clinical point of  view:\n\u25a0 Most T1-weighted images show dark fluid and bright \nfat\u2014for example, within the brain the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark.\n\u25a0 T2-weighted images demonstrate a bright signal from fluid and an intermediate signal from fat\u2014for example, in the brain the CSF appears white.\nMRI can also be used to assess flow within vessels and \nto produce complex angiograms of  the peripheral and \ncerebral circulation.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging\nDiffusion-weighted imaging provides information on the degree of  Brownian motion of  water molecules in various tissues. There is relatively free diffusion in extracellular spaces and more restricted diffusion in intracellular spaces. In tumors and infarcted tissue, there is an increase in intracellular fluid water molecules compared with the extracellular fluid environment resulting in overall increased restricted diffusion, and therefore identification of  abnormal from normal tissue.\nNuclear medicine imaging\nNuclear medicine involves imaging using gamma rays, which are another type of  electromagnetic radiation.

Film markers should be placed on the appropriate side. (Occasionally patients have dextrocardia, which may be misinterpreted if  the film marker is placed inappropriately .) A good-quality chest radiograph will demonstrate the lungs, cardiomediastinal contour, dia -\nphragm, ribs, and peripheral soft tissues.\nAbdominal radiograph\nPlain abdominal radiographs are obtained in the AP  \nsupine position. From time to time an erect plain abdominal radiograph is obtained when small bowel obstruction is suspected.\nGastrointestinal contrast examinations\nHigh-density contrast medium is ingested to opacify the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. As described previously (p. 6), the bowel is insufflated with air (or carbon dioxide) to provide a double-contrast study . In many countries, endoscopy has superseded upper gastro -\nintestinal imaging, but the mainstay of  imaging the large bowel is the double-contrast barium enema. Typically the patient needs to undergo bowel preparation, in which powerful cathartics are used to empty the bowel. At the time of  the examination a small tube is placed into the rectum and a barium suspension is run into the large bowel. The patient undergoes a series of  twists and turns so that the contrast passes through the entire large bowel. The contrast is emptied and air is passed through the same tube to insufflate the large bowel. A thin layer of  barium coats the normal mucosa, allowing mucosal detail to be visualized (see Fig. 1.4).\nUrological contrast studies\nIntravenous urography is the standard investigation for assessing the urinary tract. Intravenous contrast medium is injected, and images are obtained as the medium is excreted through the kidneys. A series of  films are obtained during this period from immediately after the injection up to approximately 20 minutes later, when the bladder is full of  contrast medium.\nThis series of  radiographs demonstrates the kidneys, \nureters, and bladder and enables assessment of  the retro-peritoneum and other structures that may press on the urinary tract.emitter).

The rays are detected by a 360-degree rotating camera, which allows the construction of  3D images. SPECT can be used to diagnose a wide range of  disease conditions such as coronary artery  \ndisease and bone fractures.\nIMAGE INTERPRETATION\nImaging is necessary in most clinical specialties to diagnose pathological changes to tissues. It is paramount to appreci -\nate what is normal and what is abnormal. An appreciation of  how the image is obtained, what the normal variations are, and what technical considerations are necessary to obtain a radiological diagnosis.

Numerous laws govern the amount of  radiation exposure that a patient can undergo for a variety of  proce -\ndures, and these are monitored to prevent any excess or additional dosage. Whenever a radiograph is booked, the clinician ordering the procedure must appreciate its neces -\nsity and understand the dose given to the patient to ensure that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.\nImaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI are \nideal because they do not impart significant risk to the patient. Moreover, ultrasound imaging is the modality of  choice for assessing the fetus.\nAny imaging device is expensive, and consequently  \nthe more complex the imaging technique (e.g., MRI) the more expensive the investigation. Investigations must be carried out judiciously , based on a sound clinical history and examination, for which an understanding of  anatomy is vital.Computed tomography\nComputed tomography is the preferred terminology rather than computerized tomography , though both terms are used interchangeably by physicians.\nIt is important for the student to understand the presen -\ntation of  images. Most images are acquired in the axial plane and viewed such that the observer looks from below and upward toward the head (from the foot of  the bed). By implication:\n\u25a0 the right side of  the patient is on the left side of  the \nimage, and\n\u25a0 the upper most border of  the image is anterior.\nMany patients are given oral and intravenous contrast \nmedia to differentiate bowel loops from other abdominal organs and to assess the vascularity of  normal anatomical structures. When intravenous contrast is given, the earlier the images are obtained, the greater the likelihood of  arte-rial enhancement. As the time is delayed between injection and image acquisition, a venous phase and an equilibrium phase are also obtained.\nThe great advantage of  CT scanning is the ability to \nextend and compress the gray scale to visualize the bones, soft tissues, and visceral organs. Altering the window set -\ntings and window centering provides the physician with specific information about these structures.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nThere is no doubt that MRI has revolutionized the under -\nstanding and interpretation of  the brain and its coverings. Furthermore, it has significantly altered the practice of  musculoskeletal medicine and surgery . Images can be obtained in any plane and in most sequences. Typically the images are viewed using the same principles as CT . Intrave -\nnous contrast agents are also used to further enhance tissue contrast. Typically , MRI contrast agents contain paramag -\nnetic substances (e.g., gadolinium and manganese).\nNuclear medicine imaging\nMost nuclear medicine images are functional studies.

Generally , an \nadjacent artery gives off  a nutrient artery , usually one per \nbone, that directly enters the internal cavity of  the bone and supplies the marrow, spongy bone, and inner layers of  compact bone. In addition, all bones are covered externally , except in the area of  a joint where articular cartilage is present, by a fibrous connective tissue membrane called the periosteum, which has the unique capability of  forming new bone. This membrane receives blood vessels whose branches supply the outer layers of  compact bone. A bone stripped of  its periosteum will not survive. Nerves accompany the vessels that supply the bone and the periosteum. Most of  the nerves passing into the internal cavity with the nutrient artery are vasomotor fibers that regulate blood flow . Bone itself  has few sensory nerve fibers. On the other hand, the \nperiosteum is supplied with numerous sensory nerve fibers and is very sensitive to any type of  injury .\nDevelopmentally , all bones come from mesenchyme by \neither intramembranous ossification, in which mesenchy -\nmal models of  bones undergo ossification, or endochondral ossification, in which cartilaginous models of  bones form from mesenchyme and undergo ossification.\nIn the clinic\nDetermination of skeletal age\nThroughout life the bones develop in a predictable way to \nform the skeletally mature adult at the end of puberty. In western countries skeletal maturity tends to occur between \nthe ages of 20 and 25 years. However, this may well vary \naccording to geography and socioeconomic conditions. Skeletal maturity will also be determined by genetic factors and disease states.\nUp until the age of skeletal maturity, bony growth and \ndevelopment follows a typically predictable ordered state, which can be measured through either ultrasound, plain radiographs, or MRI scanning. Typically, the nondominant (left) hand is radiographed, and the radiograph is compared \nto a series of standard radiographs. From these images the \nbone age can be determined (Fig. 1.14).\nIn certain disease states, such as malnutrition and \nhypothyroidism, bony maturity may be slow. If the skeletal bone age is significantly reduced from the patient\u2019s true age, \ntreatment may be required.\nIn the healthy individual the bone age accurately \nrepresents the true age of the patient.

Fractures may also occur in bone that is of poor quality (osteoporosis); \nin such cases a normal stress is placed upon a bone that is \nnot of sufficient quality to withstand this force and subsequently fractures.\nIn children whose bones are still developing, fractures \nmay occur across the growth plate or across the shaft. These \nshaft fractures typically involve partial cortical disruption, \nsimilar to breaking a branch of a young tree; hence they are termed \u201cgreenstick\u201d fractures.\nAfter a fracture has occurred, the natural response is to \nheal the fracture. Between the fracture margins a blood clot is formed into which new vessels grow. A jelly-like matrix is formed, and further migration of collagen-producing cells occurs. On this soft tissue framework, calcium hydroxyapatite is produced by osteoblasts and forms \ninsoluble crystals, and then bone matrix is laid down. As \nmore bone is produced, a callus can be demonstrated forming across the fracture site.\nTreatment of fractures requires a fracture line reduction. If \nthis cannot be maintained in a plaster of Paris cast, it may \nrequire internal or external fixation with screws and metal \nrods (Fig. 1.16B).\nFig. 1.16  Radiograph, la teral view, showing fracture of the ulna \nat the elbow joint (A) and repair of this fracture (B) using \ninternal fixation with a plate and multiple screws. \nA\nB\nIn the clinic\nAvascular necrosis\nAvascular necrosis is cellular death of bone resulting from a temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to that bone.

In these patients there is loss of continuity of the cortical medullary blood flow with loss of blood flow deep to the retinacular fibers. This \nessentially renders the femoral head bloodless; it \nsubsequently undergoes necrosis and collapses (Fig. 1.17). In these patients it is necessary to replace the femoral head with a prosthesis.\nFig. 1.17  Image of the hip joints demonstra ting loss of height of \nthe right femoral head with juxta-articular bony sclerosis and \nsubchondral cyst formation secondary to avascular necrosis. \nThere is also significant wasting of the muscles supporting the \nhip, which is secondary to disuse and pain. \nNormal left hip Bladder Avascular necrosisWasting of gluteal muscle"

This increase in activity renders the growth plates more vulnerable to injuries, which may occur from dislocation across a growth plate or fracture through a growth plate. \nOccasionally an injury may result in growth plate \ncompression, destroying that region of the growth plate, which may result in asymmetrical growth across that joint region.

A\nBSynovial joint\nSolid jointBone Articular cavity Bone\nBone Connective tissue Bone\nJoints\nThe sites where two skeletal elements come together  \nare termed joints. The two general categories of  joints  \n(Fig. 1.18) are those in which:\n\u25a0 the sk eletal elements are separated by a cavity (i.e., \nsynovial joints), and\n\u25a0 there is no ca vity and the components are held together \nby connective tissue (i.e., solid joints ).\nBlood vessels that cross over a joint and nerves that \ninnervate muscles acting on a joint usually contribute \narticular branches to that joint.\nSynovial joints\nSynovial joints are connections between skeletal compo -\nnents where the elements involved are separated by a narrow articular cavity (Fig. 1.19). In addition to contain-ing an articular cavity , these joints have a number of  characteristic features.\nFirst, a layer of  cartilage, usually hyaline cartilage, \ncovers the articulating surfaces of  the skeletal elements. In other words, bony surfaces do not normally contact one another directly . As a consequence, when these joints are viewed in normal radiographs, a wide gap seems to sepa -\nrate the adjacent bones because the cartilage that covers the articulating surfaces is more transparent to X-rays than bone.\nA second characteristic feature of  synovial joints is the \npresence of  a joint capsule consisting of  an inner syno-\nvial membrane and an outer fibrous membrane.\u25a0 The syno vial membrane attaches to the margins of  the \njoint surfaces at the interface between the cartilage and bone and encloses the articular cavity . The synovial membrane is highly vascular and produces synovial fluid, which percolates into the articular cavity and lubricates the articulating surfaces. Closed sacs of  synovial membrane also occur outside joints, where they form synovial bursae or tendon sheaths. Bursae often intervene between structures, such as tendons and bone, tendons and joints, or skin and bone, and reduce the friction of  one structure moving over the other. Tendon sheaths surround tendons and also reduce friction.\n\u25a0 The fibrous membrane is formed by dense connective \ntissue and surrounds and stabilizes the joint. Parts of  the fibrous membrane may thicken to form ligaments, which further stabilize the joint. Ligaments outside the capsule usually provide additional reinforcement.\nAnother common but not universal feature of  synovial \njoints is the presence of  additional structures within the \narea enclosed by the capsule or synovial membrane, such as articular discs (usually composed of  fibrocartilage), \nfat pads, and tendons. Articular discs absorb compres -\nsion forces, adjust to changes in the contours of  joint sur -\nfaces during movements, and increase the range of  movements that can occur at joints. Fat pads usually occur between the synovial membrane and the capsule and move"

Arthroscopy can be performed in most joints. However, \nit is most commonly performed in the knee, shoulder, ankle, \nand hip joints.\nArthroscopy allows the surgeon to view the inside of the \njoint and its contents. Notably, in the knee, the menisci and the ligaments are easily seen, and it is possible using \nseparate puncture sites and specific instruments to remove \nthe menisci and replace the cruciate ligaments. The advantages of arthroscopy are that it is performed through small incisions, it enables patients to quickly recover and \nreturn to normal activity, and it only requires either a light \nanesthetic or regional anesthesia during the procedure.In the clinic\u2014cont\u2019d\nFig. 1.24  Af ter knee replacement. This radiograph shows the \nposition of the prosthesis. \nIn the clinic\nJoint replacement\nJoint replacement is undertaken for a variety of reasons. These predominantly include degenerative joint disease and joint destruction. Joints that have severely degenerated or \nlack their normal function are painful. In some patients, the \npain may be so severe that it prevents them from leaving the house and undertaking even the smallest of activities without discomfort.\nLarge joints are commonly affected, including the hip, \nknee, and shoulder. However, with ongoing developments in joint replacement materials and surgical techniques, even small joints of the fingers can be replaced.\nTypically, both sides of the joint are replaced; in the hip \njoint the acetabulum will be reamed, and a plastic or metal cup will be introduced. The femoral component will be fitted precisely to the femur and cemented in place (Fig. 1.25).\nMost patients derive significant benefit from joint \nreplacement and continue to lead an active life afterward. In \na minority of patients who have been fitted with a metal \nacetabular cup and metal femoral component, an aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion (ALVAL) may develop, possibly caused by a hypersensitivity response to the release of metal ions in adjacent tissues. These \npatients often have chronic pain and might need additional \nsurgery to replace these joint replacements with safer models.\nFig. 1.25  This is a radiograph, ant eroposterior view, of the \npelvis after a right total hip replacement.

The epidermis is the outer cel -\nlular layer of  stratified squamous epithelium, which is \navascular and varies in thickness. The dermis is a dense bed \nof  vascular connective tissue.\nThe skin functions as a mechanical and permeability \nbarrier, and as a sensory and thermoregulatory organ. It \nalso can initiate primary immune responses.\nFascia\nFascia is connective tissue containing varying amounts of  \nfat that separate, support, and interconnect organs and \nstructures, enable movement of  one structure relative to \nanother, and allow the transit of  vessels and nerves from \none area to another. There are two general categories of  \nfascia: superficial and deep.\n\u25a0 Superficial (subcutaneous) fascia lies just deep to and is \nattached to the dermis of  the skin. It is made up of  loose \nconnective tissue usually containing a large amount of  \nfat. The thickness of  the superficial fascia (subcutane -\nous tissue) varies considerably , both from one area of  \nthe body to another and from one individual to another. \nThe superficial fascia allows movement of  the skin over \ndeeper areas of  the body , acts as a conduit for vessels and \nnerves coursing to and from the skin, and serves as an \nenergy (fat) reservoir.\n\u25a0 Deep fascia usually consists of  dense, organized connec -\ntive tissue. The outer layer of  deep fascia is attached to \nthe deep surface of  the superficial fascia and forms a \nthin fibrous covering over most of  the deeper region of  \nthe body . Inward extensions of  this fascial layer form \nintermuscular septa that compartmentalize groups of  \nmuscles with similar functions and innervations. Other \nextensions surround individual muscles and groups of  \nvessels and nerves, forming an investing fascia. Near \nsome joints the deep fascia thickens, forming retinacula. \nThese fascial retinacula hold tendons in place and \nprevent them from bowing during movements at the \njoints. Finally , there is a layer of  deep fascia separating \nthe membrane lining the abdominal cavity (the parietal \nperitoneum) from the fascia covering the deep surface \nof  the muscles of  the abdominal wall (the transversalis \nfascia). This layer is referred to as extraperitoneal \nfascia . A similar layer of  fascia in the thorax is termed \nthe endothoracic fascia .In the clinic\nThe importance of fascias\nA fascia is a thin band of tissue that surrounds muscles, \nbones, organs, nerves, and blood vessels and often \nremains uninterrupted as a 3D structure between tissues. It \nprovides important support for tissues and can provide a \nboundary between structures.\nClinically, fascias are extremely important because they \noften limit the spread of infection and malignant disease. \nWhen infections or malignant diseases cross a fascial \nplain, a primary surgical clearance may require a far more \nextensive dissection to render the area free of tumor or \ninfection.\nA typical example of the clinical importance of a fascial \nlayer would be of that covering the psoas muscle. \nInfection within an intervertebral body secondary to \ntuberculosis can pass laterally into the psoas muscle. Pus \nfills the psoas muscle but is limited from further spread by \nthe psoas fascia, which surrounds the muscle and extends \ninferiorly into the groin pointing below the inguinal \nligament.\nIn the clinic\nPlacement of skin incisions and scarring\nSurgical skin incisions are ideally placed along or parallel \nto Langer\u2019s lines, which are lines of skin tension that \ncorrespond to the orientation of the dermal collagen \nfibers. They tend to run in the same direction as the \nunderlying muscle fibers and incisions that are made \nalong these lines tend to heal better with less scarring. In \ncontrast, incisions made perpendicular to Langer\u2019s lines \nare more likely to heal with a prominent scar and in some \nsevere cases can lead to raised, firm, hypertrophic, or \nkeloid, scars.\nMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nThe muscular system is generally regarded as consisting of  \none type of  muscle found in the body\u2014skeletal muscle. \nHowever, there are two other types of  muscle tissue found \nin the body , smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, that are \nimportant components of  other systems. These three types \nof  muscle can be characterized by whether they are con -\ntrolled voluntarily or involuntarily , whether they appear \nstriated (striped) or smooth, and whether they are associ -\nated with the body wall (somatic) or with organs and blood \nvessels (visceral).\n\u25a0 Skeletal muscle forms the majority of  the muscle tissue \nin the body .

Examples of  small and medium veins are \nsuperficial veins in the upper and lower limbs and  \ndeeper veins of  the leg and forearm.\n\u25a0 Venules are the smallest veins and drain the \ncapillaries.\nAlthough veins are similar in general structure to arter -\nies, they have a number of  distinguishing features.\n\u25a0 The walls of  veins, specifically the tunica media, are \nthin.\n\u25a0 The luminal diameters of  veins are large.\n\u25a0 There often are multiple veins (venae comitantes) closely \nassociated with arteries in peripheral regions.\n\u25a0 Valves often are present in veins, particularly in periph -\neral vessels inferior to the level of  the heart. These are \nusually paired cusps that facilitate blood flow toward  \nthe heart.\nMore specific information about the cardiovascular \nsystem and how it relates to the circulation of  blood \nthroughout the body will be discussed, where appropriate, \nin each of  the succeeding chapters of  the text.CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM\nThe cardiovascular system consists of  the heart, which \npumps blood throughout the body , and the blood vessels, \nwhich are a closed network of  tubes that transport the \nblood. There are three types of  blood vessels:\n\u25a0 arteries, which transport blood away from the heart;\n\u25a0 veins, which transport blood toward the heart;\n\u25a0 capillaries, which connect the arteries and veins, are the \nsmallest of  the blood vessels and are where oxygen, \nnutrients, and wastes are exchanged within the tissues.\nThe walls of  the blood vessels of  the cardiovascular \nsystem usually consist of  three layers or tunics:\n\u25a0 tunica externa (adventitia)\u2014the outer connective tissue \nlayer,\n\u25a0 tunica media\u2014the middle smooth muscle layer (may \nalso contain varying amounts of  elastic fibers in medium \nand large arteries), and\n\u25a0 tunica intima\u2014the inner endothelial lining of  the blood \nvessels.\nArteries are usually further subdivided into three \nclasses, according to the variable amounts of  smooth \nmuscle and elastic fibers contributing to the thickness of  \nthe tunica media, the overall size of  the vessel, and its \nfunction.\n\u25a0 Large elastic arteries contain substantial amounts of  \nelastic fibers in the tunica media, allowing expansion \nand recoil during the normal cardiac cycle. This helps \nmaintain a constant flow of  blood during diastole. \nExamples of  large elastic arteries are the aorta, the \nbrachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid artery , \nthe left subclavian artery , and the pulmonary trunk.\n\u25a0 Medium muscular arteries are composed of  a tunica \nmedia that contains mostly smooth muscle fibers. This \ncharacteristic allows these vessels to regulate their \ndiameter and control the flow of  blood to different parts \nof  the body . Examples of  medium muscular arteries are \nmost of  the named arteries, including the femoral, axil -\nlary , and radial arteries.\n\u25a0 Small arteries and arterioles control the filling of  the \ncapillaries and directly contribute to the arterial pres -\nsure in the vascular system.\nVeins also are subdivided into three classes.\n\u25a0 Large veins contain some smooth muscle in the tunica \nmedia, but the thickest layer is the tunica externa. In the clinic\nAtherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis is a disease that affects arteries. There is a \nchronic inflammatory reaction in the walls of the arteries, \nwith deposition of cholesterol and fatty proteins. This may \nin turn lead to secondary calcification, with reduction in \nthe diameter of the vessels impeding distal flow. The \nplaque itself may be a site for attraction of platelets that \nmay \u201cfall off\u201d (embolize) distally. Plaque fissuring may \noccur, which allows fresh clots to form and occlude the \nvessel.\nThe importance of atherosclerosis and its effects \ndepend upon which vessel is affected. If atherosclerosis \noccurs in the carotid artery, small emboli may form and \nproduce a stroke. In the heart, plaque fissuring may \nproduce an acute vessel thrombosis, producing a \nmyocardial infarction (heart attack). In the legs, chronic \nnarrowing of vessels may limit the ability of the patient to \nwalk and ultimately cause distal ischemia and gangrene of \nthe toes."

Blood is also pumped from the superficial veins through the investing layer of fascia of the leg into the deep veins. Valves in these perforating veins may become damaged, allowing blood to \npass in the opposite direction. This increased volume and \npressure produces dilatation and tortuosity of the superficial veins (Fig. 1.27). Apart from the unsightliness of larger veins, the skin may become pigmented and atrophic with a poor \nresponse to tissue trauma. In some patients even small \ntrauma may produce skin ulceration, which requires elevation of the limb and application of pressure bandages to heal.\nTreatment of varicose veins depends on their location, \nsize, and severity. Typically the superficial varicose veins can be excised and stripped, allowing blood only to drain into the deep system.\nFig. 1.27  Phot ograph demonstrating varicose veins. \nVaricose veins\nIn the clinic\nAnastomoses and collateral circulation\nAll organs require a blood supply from the arteries and drainage by veins. Within most organs there are multiple ways of perfusing the tissue such that if the main vessel \nfeeding the organ or vein draining the organ is blocked, a \nseries of smaller vessels (collateral vessels) continue to supply and drain the organ.\nIn certain circumstances, organs have more than one \nvessel perfusing them, such as the hand, which is supplied \nby the radial and ulnar arteries. Loss of either the radial or \nthe ulnar artery may not produce any symptoms of reduced perfusion to the hand.\nThere are circumstances in which loss of a vein produces \nsignificant venous collateralization. Some of these venous collaterals become susceptible to bleeding. This is a considerable problem in patients who have undergone portal vein thrombosis or occlusion, where venous drainage from \nthe gut bypasses the liver through collateral veins to return \nto the systemic circulation.\nNormal vascular anastomoses associated with an organ \nare important. Some organs, such as the duodenum, have a dual blood supply arising from the branches of the celiac \ntrunk and also from the branches of the superior mesenteric \nartery. Should either of these vessels be damaged, blood supply will be maintained to the organ. The brain has multiple vessels supplying it, dominated by the carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries. Vessels within the brain \nare end arteries and have a poor collateral circulation; hence \nany occlusion will produce long-term cerebral damage."

These activities can occur independently of  the brain and spinal cord, but can also be modified by input from preganglionic parasym-pathetic and postganglionic sympathetic fibers.\nSensory information from the enteric system is carried \nback to the CNS by visceral sensory fibers.\nNerve plexuses\nNerve plexuses are either somatic or visceral and combine fibers from different sources or levels to form new nerves with specific targets or destinations (Fig. 1.49). Plexuses of  the enteric system also generate reflex activity independent of  the CNS.\nSomatic plexuses\nMajor somatic plexuses formed from the anterior rami of  spinal nerves are the cervical (C1 to C4), brachial (C5 to T1), lumbar (L1 to L4), sacral (L4 to S4), and coccygeal (S5 to Co) plexuses. Except for spinal nerve T1, the anterior rami of  thoracic spinal nerves remain independent and do not participate in plexuses.\nVisceral plexuses\nVisceral nerve plexuses are formed in association with viscera and generally contain efferent (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and afferent components (Fig. 1.49). These plexuses include cardiac and pulmonary plexuses in the thorax and a large prevertebral plexus in the abdomen anterior to the aorta, which extends inferiorly onto the lateral walls of  the pelvis. The massive prevertebral plexus supplies input to and receives output from all abdominal and pelvic viscera.In the clinic\nReferred pain\nReferred pain occurs when sensory information comes to \nthe spinal cord from one location but is interpreted by the CNS as coming from another location innervated by the \nsame spinal cord level. Usually, this happens when the \npain information comes from a region, such as the gut, which has a low amount of sensory output. These afferents converge on neurons at the same spinal cord level that receive information from the skin, which is an \narea with a high amount of sensory output. As a result, \npain from the normally low output region is interpreted as coming from the normally high output region.\nPain is most often referred from a region innervated by \nthe visceral part of the nervous system to a region innervated, at the same spinal cord level, by the somatic side of the nervous system.\nPain can also be referred from one somatic region  \nto another. For example, irritation of the peritoneum  \non the inferior surface of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerve, can be referred to  \nthe skin on the top of the shoulder, which is innervated by other somatic nerves arising at the same spinal  \ncord level.\nOTHER SYSTEMS\nSpecific information about the organization and compo -\nnents of  the respiratory , gastrointestinal, and urogenital \nsystems will be discussed in each of  the succeeding chapters of  this text."

After some hours, the pain began to localize in the right iliac fossa and \nbecame constant. He was referred to an abdominal \nsurgeon, who removed a grossly inflamed appendix. The patient made an uneventful recovery.\nWhen the appendix becomes inflamed, the visceral sensory \nfibers are stimulated. These fibers enter the spinal cord with \nthe sympathetic fibers at spinal cord level T10. The pain is referred to the dermatome of T10, which is in the umbilical region (Fig. 1.50). The pain is diffuse, not focal; every time a peristaltic wave passes through the ileocecal region, the pain \nrecurs. This intermittent type of pain is referred to as colic.\nIn the later stages of the disease, the appendix contacts and \nirritates the parietal peritoneum in the right iliac fossa, which is innervated by somatic sensory nerves. This produces a \nconstant focal pain, which predominates over the colicky \npain that the patient felt some hours previously. The patient no longer interprets the referred pain from the T10 dermatome.\nAlthough this is a typical history for appendicitis, it should \nalways be borne in mind that the patient\u2019s symptoms and signs may vary. The appendix is situated in a retrocecal position in approximately 70% of patients; therefore it may never contact the parietal peritoneum anteriorly in the right \niliac fossa. It is also possible that the appendix is long and \nmay directly contact other structures. As a consequence, the patient may have other symptoms (e.g., the appendix may contact the ureter, and the patient may then develop urological symptoms).\nAlthough appendicitis is common, other disorders, for \nexample of the bowel and pelvis, may produce similar symptoms.\nFig. 1.50  Mechanism f or referred pain from an inflamed \nappendix to the T10 dermatome.

In addition to providing support for each of  these parts of  the body , the vertebrae provide attachments for muscles and fascia, and articulation sites for other bones. The anterior rami of  spinal nerves associated with the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis pass into these parts of  the body from the back.\nLimbs\nThe bones of  the back provide extensive attachments for muscles associated with anchoring and moving the upper limbs on the trunk. This is less true of  the lower limbs, which are firmly anchored to the vertebral column through articulation of  the pelvic bones with the sacrum. The upper and lower limbs are innervated by anterior rami of  spinal nerves that emerge from cervical and lumbosacral levels, respectively , of  the vertebral column.\nKEY FEATURES\nLong vertebral column and short  \nspinal cord\nDuring development, the vertebral column grows much \nfaster than the spinal cord. As a result, the spinal cord  \ndoes not extend the entire length of  the vertebral canal (Fig. 2.11).\nIn the adult, the spinal cord typically ends between \nvertebrae LI and LII, although it can end as high as vertebra TXII and as low as the disc between vertebrae LII and LIII.\nSpinal nerves originate from the spinal cord at increas -\ningly oblique angles from vertebrae CI to Co, and the nerve roots pass in the vertebral canal for increasingly longer distances. Their spinal cord level of  origin therefore becomes increasingly dissociated from their vertebral column level of  exit.

A typical thoracic vertebra has two partial facets (superior and inferior costal facets) on each side of  the vertebral body for articulation with the head  \nof  its own rib and the head of  the rib below (Fig. 2.20C). The superior costal facet is much larger than the inferior costal facet.\nEach transverse process also has a facet (transverse \ncostal facet) for articulation with the tubercle of  its own rib. The vertebral body of  the vertebra is somewhat heart shaped when viewed from above, and the vertebral foramen is circular.\nLumbar vertebrae\nThe five lumbar vertebrae are distinguished from vertebrae in other regions by their large size (Fig. 2.20D). Also, they lack facets for articulation with ribs. The transverse proc -\nesses are generally thin and long, with the exception of  those on vertebra LV , which are massive and somewhat cone shaped for the attachment of  iliolumbar ligaments \nto connect the transverse processes to the pelvic bones.\nThe vertebral body of  a typical lumbar vertebra is cylin -\ndrical and the vertebral foramen is triangular in shape and larger than in the thoracic vertebrae.\nSacrum\nThe sacrum is a single bone that represents the five fused sacral vertebrae (Fig. 2.20E).

The procedure is most commonly performed for osteoporotic wedge fractures, which are a considerable cause of morbidity and pain in older patients.\nOsteoporotic wedge fractures (Fig. 2.25) typically occur in \nthe thoracolumbar region, and the approach to performing vertebroplasty is novel and relatively straightforward. The procedure is performed under sedation or light general anesthetic. Using X-ray guidance the pedicle is identified on the anteroposterior image. A metal cannula is placed through \nthe pedicle into the vertebral body. Liquid bone cement is \ninjected via the cannula into the vertebral body (Fig. 2.26). The function of the bone cement is two-fold. First, it increases the strength of the vertebral body and prevents further loss of height. Furthermore, as the bone cement sets, \nthere is a degree of heat generated that is believed to \ndisrupt pain nerve endings. Kyphoplasty is a similar technique that aims to restore some or all of the lost vertebral body height from the wedge fracture by injecting liquid bone cement into the vertebral body.\nFig. 2.25  Radiograph of the l umbar region of the vertebral \ncolumn demonstrating a wedge fracture of the L1 vertebra.

It is thought that there is \nsome initial axial rotation of the vertebrae, which then alters \nthe locations of the mechanical compressive and distractive forces applied through the vertebral growth plates, leading to changes in speed of bone growth and ultimately changes \nto spinal curvature. These are never present at birth and tend \nto occur in either the infantile, juvenile, or adolescent age groups. The vertebral bodies and posterior elements (pedicles and laminae) are normal in these patients.\nWhen a scoliosis is present from birth (congenital \nscoliosis) it is usually associated with other developmental abnormalities. In these patients, there is a strong association with other abnormalities of the chest wall, genitourinary tract, and heart disease. This group of patients needs careful \nevaluation by many specialists.\nA rare but important group of scoliosis is that in which the \nmuscle is abnormal. Muscular dystrophy is the commonest \nexample. The abnormal muscle does not retain the normal alignment of the vertebral column, and curvature develops as \na result. A muscle biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis.\nOther disorders that can produce scoliosis include bone \ntumors, spinal cord tumors, and localized disc protrusions.\nA\nFig. 2.27  S evere scoliosis.

When cancer cells grow within the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements, they \ninterrupt normal bone cell turnover, leading to either bone \ndestruction or formation and destroying the mechanical properties of the bone. A minor injury may therefore lead to vertebral collapse (Fig. 2.30A). Cancer cells have a much higher glucose metabolism compared with normal adjacent bone cells. These metastatic cancer cells can therefore be \ndetected by administering radioisotope-labeled glucose to a \npatient and then tracing where the labeled glucose has been metabolized (Fig. 2.30B). Importantly, vertebrae that contain extensive metastatic disease may extrude fragments of tumor into the vertebral canal, compressing nerves and the \nspinal cord.\nA B2B1\nFig. 2.30  A.

It is a metabolic bone disorder that commonly \noccurs in women in their 50s and 60s and in men in  \ntheir 70s.\nMany factors influence the development of osteoporosis, \nincluding genetic predetermination, level of activity and \nnutritional status, and, in particular, estrogen levels in \nwomen.\nTypical complications of osteoporosis include \u201ccrush\u201d \nvertebral body fractures, distal fractures of the radius, and \nhip fractures.With increasing age and poor-quality bone, patients are \nmore susceptible to fracture. Healing tends to be impaired in \nthese elderly patients, who consequently require long \nhospital stays and prolonged rehabilitation.\nPatients likely to develop osteoporosis can be identified \nby dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Low-dose X-rays are passed through the bone, and by \ncounting the number of photons detected and knowing the \ndose given, the number of X-rays absorbed by the bone can be calculated. The amount of X-ray absorption can be directly correlated with the bone mass, and this can be used to predict whether a patient is at risk for osteoporotic \nfractures.\nJOINTS\nJoints between vertebrae in the back\nThe two major types of  joints between vertebrae are:\n\u25a0 symph yses between vertebral bodies (Fig. 2.31), and\n\u25a0 syno vial joints between articular processes (Fig. 2.32).\nA typical vertebra has a total of  six joints with adjacent \nvertebrae: four synovial joints (two above and two below) \nand two symphyses (one above and one below). Each symphysis includes an intervertebral disc.\nAlthough the movement between any two vertebrae is \nlimited, the summation of  movement among all vertebrae results in a large range of  movement by the vertebral column.\nMovements by the vertebral column include flexion, \nextension, lateral flexion, rotation, and circumduction.\nMovements by vertebrae in a specific region (cervical, \nthoracic, and lumbar) are determined by the shape and orientation of  joint surfaces on the articular processes and on the vertebral bodies.Fig. 2.31  Int ervertebral joints.

A thin articular capsule attached to the margins of  the articular facets encloses each joint.\nIn cervical regions, the zygapophysial joints slope infe -\nriorly from anterior to posterior and their shape facilitates flexion and extension. In thoracic regions, the joints are oriented vertically and their shape limits flexion and exten -\nsion, but facilitates rotation. In lumbar regions, the joint surfaces are curved and adjacent processes interlock, thereby limiting range of  movement, though flexion and extension are still major movements in the lumbar region.\n\u201cUncovertebral\u201d joints\nThe lateral margins of  the upper surfaces of  typical cervi -\ncal vertebrae are elevated into crests or lips termed uncinate processes. These may articulate with the body of  the ver -\ntebra above to form small \u201cuncovertebral\u201d synovial joints (Fig. 2.33)."

In cases involving discs, it may be \nnecessary to operate and remove the disc that is pressing \non the nerve.\nNot infrequently, patients complain of pain and no \nimmediate cause is found; the pain is therefore attributed to mechanical discomfort, which may be caused by \ndegenerative disease.

A tear can occur within  \nthe anulus fibrosus through which the material of the nucleus pulposus can track. After a period of time, this material may track into the vertebral canal or into the intervertebral foramen to impinge on neural structures  (Fig. 2.34). This is a common cause of back pain.

In degenerative conditions of the vertebral column, the ligamenta flava \nmay hypertrophy. This is often associated with \nhypertrophy and arthritic change of the zygapophysial joints.

In most instances, the fracture will heal under appropriate circumstances. At the time of injury, it is not the \nfracture itself but related damage to the contents of the \nvertebral canal and the surrounding tissues that determines the severity of the patient\u2019s condition.\nVertebral column stability is divided into three arbitrary \nclinical \u201ccolumns\u201d: the anterior column consists of the \nvertebral bodies and the anterior longitudinal ligament; the middle column comprises the vertebral body and the posterior longitudinal ligament; and the posterior column is \nmade up of the ligamenta flava, interspinous ligaments, \nsupraspinous ligaments, and the ligamentum nuchae in the \ncervical vertebral column.\nDestruction of one of the clinical columns is usually a \nstable injury requiring little more than rest and appropriate analgesia. Disruption of two columns is highly likely to be unstable and requires fixation and immobilization. A \nthree-column spinal injury usually results in a significant \nneurological event and requires fixation to prevent further extension of the neurological defect and to create vertebral column stability.\nAt the craniocervical junction, a complex series of \nligaments create stability. If the traumatic incident disrupts craniocervical stability, the chances of a significant spinal cord injury are extremely high. The consequences are quadriplegia. In addition, respiratory function may be compromised by paralysis of the phrenic nerve (which arises \nfrom spinal nerves C3 to C5), and severe hypotension (low \nblood pressure) may result from central disruption of the sympathetic part of the autonomic division of the nervous system.\n(continues)"

(Clinicians often refer to parts of the back in shorthand terms that are not strictly \nanatomical; for example, facet joints and apophyseal joints \nare terms used instead of zygapophysial joints, and spinal column is used instead of vertebral column.)\nIt is possible for a vertebra to slip anteriorly upon its \ninferior counterpart without a pars interarticularis fracture. \nUsually this is related to abnormal anatomy of the facet \njoints, facet joint degenerative change.

Throughout this vast expanse, the lateral positioning of  the longissimus muscle is in  \nthe area of  the transverse processes of  the various vertebrae.\n\u25a0 The most medial m uscle column is the spinalis, which \nis the smallest of  the subdivisions and interconnects the spinous processes of  adjacent vertebrae. The spinalis is most constant in the thoracic region and is generally absent in the cervical region. It is associated with a deeper muscle (the semispinalis capitis) as the erector spinae group approaches the skull.\nThe muscles in the erector spinae group are the primary \nextensors of  the vertebral column and head. Acting bilat -\nerally , they straighten the back, returning it to the upright \nposition from a flexed position, and pull the head posteriorly . They also participate in controlling vertebral column flexion by contracting and relaxing in a coordinated fashion. Acting unilaterally , they bend the vertebral column laterally . In addition, unilateral contractions of  muscles attached to the head turn the head to the actively contracting side.Transversospinales muscles\nThe transversospinales muscles run obliquely upward and medially from transverse processes to spinous processes, filling the groove between these two vertebral projections (Fig. 2.51 and Table 2.5). They are deep to the erector \nspinae and consist of  three major subgroups\u2014the semispi-nalis, multifidus, and rotatores muscles.\n\u25a0 The semispinalis muscles are the most superficial col-\nlection of  muscle fibers in the transversospinales group. These muscles begin in the lower thoracic region and end by attaching to the skull, crossing between four  \nand six vertebrae from their point of  origin to point of  attachment. Semispinalis muscles are found in the thoracic and cervical regions, and attach to the occipital bone at the base of  the skull.\n\u25a0 Deep to the semispinalis is the second g roup of  muscles, \nthe multifidus. Muscles in this group span the length \nof  the vertebral column, passing from a lateral point of  origin upward and medially to attach to spinous proc -\nesses and spanning between two and four vertebrae. The multifidus muscles are present throughout the length of  the vertebral column but are best developed in the lumbar region.\n\u25a0 The small rotatores muscles are the deepest of  the \ntransversospinales group. They are present throughout the length of  the vertebral column but are best devel-oped in the thoracic region. Their fibers pass upward and medially from transverse processes to spinous processes crossing two vertebrae (long rotators) or attaching to an adjacent vertebra (short rotators)."

However, when muscles on only one side contract, they pull the spinous processes toward the transverse processes on that side, causing the trunk to turn or rotate in the opposite direction.\nOne muscle in the transversospinales group, the semi-\nspinalis capitis, has a unique action because it attaches to the skull. Contracting bilaterally , this muscle pulls the head posteriorly , whereas unilateral contraction pulls the head posteriorly and turns it, causing the chin to move superiorly and turn toward the side of  the contracting muscle. These actions are similar to those of  the upper erector spinae.\nSegmental muscles\nThe two groups of  segmental muscles (Fig. 2.51 and Table \n2.6) are deeply placed in the back and innervated by pos -\nterior rami of  spinal nerves.\n\u25a0 The fir st group of  segmental muscles are the levatores \ncostarum muscles, which arise from the transverse processes of  vertebrae CVII and TI to TXI. They have an oblique lateral and downward direction and insert into the rib below the vertebra of  origin in the area of  the tubercle.

The atlas \nis a closed ring with no vertebral body. Axial-loading injuries, such as hitting the head while diving into shallow water or hitting the head on the roof of a car in a motor vehicle accident, can cause a \u201cburst\u201d type of fracture, where \nthe ring breaks at more than one site (Fig. 2.58). The British \nneurosurgeon, Geoffrey Jefferson, first described this fracture pattern in 1920, so these types of fractures are often called Jefferson fractures.\nFractures of the axis usually occur due to severe \nhyperextension and flexion, which can result in fracture of the tip of the dens, base of the dens, or through the body of the atlas. In judicial hangings, there is hyperextension and distraction injury causing fracture through the atlas \npedicles and spondylolisthesis of C2 on C3. This type of \nfracture is often called a hangman\u2019s fracture.\nIn many cases of upper neck injuries, even in the \nabsence of fractures to the atlas or axis, there may be injury to the atlanto-axial ligaments, which can render the \nneck unstable and pose severe risk to the brainstem and \nupper spinal cord.\nFig. 2.58  CT at the level of CI demonstrates two breaks in \nthe closed ring of the atlas following an axial-loading injury."

In addition, passage of a needle or conduit into the subarachnoid space (CSF space) is used to \ninject antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and anesthetics.\nThe lumbar region is an ideal site to access the \nsubarachnoid space because the spinal cord terminates \naround the level of the disc between vertebrae LI and LII in the adult. The subarachnoid space extends to the region of \nthe lower border of the SII vertebra. There is therefore a \nlarge CSF-filled space containing lumbar and sacral nerve roots but no spinal cord.\nDepending on the clinician\u2019s preference, the patient is \nplaced in the lateral or prone position. A needle is passed  \nin the midline in between the spinous processes into the extradural space. Further advancement punctures the  \ndura and arachnoid mater to enter the subarachnoid  \nspace. Most needles push the roots away from the tip \nwithout causing the patient any symptoms. Once the  \nneedle is in the subarachnoid space, fluid can be  aspirated. In some situations, it is important to measure CSF \npressure.\nLocal anesthetics can be injected into the extradural space \nor the subarachnoid space to anesthetize the sacral and lumbar nerve roots. Such anesthesia is useful for operations on the pelvis and the legs, which can then be carried out without the need for general anesthesia. When procedures \nare carried out, the patient must be in the erect position and \nnot lying on his or her side or in the head-down position. If a patient lies on his or her side, the anesthesia is likely to be unilateral. If the patient is placed in the head-down position, the anesthetic can pass cranially and potentially depress \nrespiration.\nIn some instances, anesthesiologists choose to carry out \nextradural anesthesia. A needle is placed through the skin, \nsupraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamenta \nflava into the areolar tissue and fat around the dura mater. \nAnesthetic agent is introduced and diffuses around the vertebral canal to anesthetize the exiting nerve roots and diffuse into the subarachnoid space.\nSpinal nerves\nEach spinal nerve is connected to the spinal cord by poste -\nrior and anterior roots (Fig. 2.61):\n\u25a0 The posterior root contains the processes of  sensory \nneurons carrying information to the CNS\u2014the cell \nbodies of  the sensory neurons, which are derived embryologically from neural crest cells, are clustered in a spinal ganglion at the distal end of  the posterior \nroot, usually in the intervertebral foramen.\n\u25a0 The anterior root contains motor nerve fibers, which \ncarry signals away from the CNS\u2014the cell bodies of  the primary motor neurons are in anterior regions of  the spinal cord.\nMedially , the posterior and anterior roots divide into \nrootlets, which attach to the spinal cord.A spinal segment is the area of  the spinal cord that \ngives rise to the posterior and anterior rootlets, which \nwill form a single pair of  spinal nerves.

It is of \nkey clinical importance to identify whether the back pain \nrelates to the vertebral column and its attachments or relates \nto other structures.\nThe failure to consider other potential structures that may \nproduce back pain can lead to significant mortality and \nmorbidity. Pain may refer to the back from a number of \norgans situated in the retroperitoneum. Pancreatic pain in \nparticular refers to the back and may be associated with \npancreatic cancer and pancreatitis. Renal pain, which may be \nproduced by stones in the renal collecting system or renal \ntumors, also typically refers to the back. More often than not \nthis is usually unilateral; however, it can produce central posterior back pain. Enlarged lymph nodes in the pre- and \npara-aortic region may produce central posterior back pain \nand may be a sign of solid tumor malignancy, infection, or \nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. An enlarging abdominal aorta \n(abdominal aortic aneurysm) may cause back pain as it \nenlarges without rupture. Therefore it is critical to think of \nthis structure as a potential cause of back pain, because \ntreatment will be lifesaving. Moreover, a ruptured abdominal \naortic aneurysm may also cause acute back pain in the first \ninstance.\nIn all patients back pain requires careful assessment not \nonly of the vertebral column but also of the chest and \nabdomen in order not to miss other important anatomical \nstructures that may produce signs and symptoms radiating \nto the back."

Often it is more prominent than the spinous process of  CVII (Fig. 2.67A,B).\nThe root of  the spine of  the scapula is at the same level \nas the spinous process of  vertebra TIII, and the inferior angle of  the scapula is level with the spinous process of  vertebra TVII (Fig. 2.67A).\nThe spinous process of  vertebra TXII is level with the \nmidpoint of  a vertical line between the inferior angle of  the scapula and the iliac crest (Fig. 2.67A).\nA horizontal line between the highest point of  the iliac \ncrest on each side crosses through the spinous process of  vertebra LIV . The LIII and LV vertebral spinous processes can be palpated above and below the LIV spinous process, respectively (Fig. 2.67A).\nThe sacral dimples that mark the position of  the poste -\nrior superior iliac spine are level with the SII vertebral spinous process (Fig. 2.67A).The tip of  the coccyx is palpable at the base of  the ver -\ntebral column between the gluteal masses (Fig. 2.67A).\nThe tips of  the vertebral spinous processes do not always \nlie in the same horizontal plane as their corresponding vertebral bodies. In thoracic regions, the spinous processes are long and sharply sloped downward so that their tips lie at the level of  the vertebral body below . In other words, the tip of  the TIII vertebral spinous process lies at vertebral level TIV .\nIn lumbar and sacral regions, the spinous processes are \ngenerally shorter and less sloped than in thoracic regions, and their palpable tips more closely reflect the position of  their corresponding vertebral bodies. As a consequence, the palpable end of  the spinous process of  vertebra LIV lies at approximately the LIV vertebral level.\nVisualizing the inferior ends of the spinal cord \nand subarachnoid space\nThe spinal cord does not occupy the entire length of   \nthe vertebral canal. Normally in adults, it terminates  \nat the level of  the disc between vertebrae LI and LII; \nhowever, it may end as high as TXII or as low as the  \ndisc between vertebrae LII and LIII.

In the past 24 hours he has had two \nepisodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine \nand now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs.\nThe attending physician performed a physical examination \nand found that the man had reduced strength during knee \nextension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also \nhad reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone.\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings \nraised serious concern for compression of multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots in the spine, affecting both motor and sensory pathways. His reduced power in extending his knees and reduced knee reflexes was suggestive of \ncompression of the L4 nerve roots. His reduced ability to \ndorsiflex his feet and toes was suggestive of compression of the L5 nerve roots. His reduced ankle reflexes was suggestive of compression of the S1 and S2 nerve roots, and his perineal numbness was suggestive of compression of the \nS3, S4, and S5 nerve roots.\nA diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome was made, and the \npatient was transferred for an urgent MRI scan, which confirmed the presence of a severely herniating L2-3 disc \ncompressing the cauda equina, giving rise to the cauda \nequina syndrome (Fig. 2.70).

In fact, his breathing became erratic and stopped.\nIf the cervical spinal cord injury is above the level of C5, \nbreathing is likely to stop. The phrenic nerve takes origin \nfrom C3, C4, and C5 and supplies the diaphragm. Breathing \nmay not cease immediately if the lesion is just below C5, but \ndoes so as the cord becomes edematous and damage \nprogresses superiorly. In addition, some respiratory and \nventilatory exchange may occur by using neck muscles plus \nthe sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, which are \ninnervated by the accessory nerve [XI].The patient was unable to sense or move his upper and \nlower limbs.\nThe patient has paralysis of the upper and lower limbs and \nis therefore quadriplegic. If breathing is unaffected, the \nlesion is below the level of C5 or at the level of C5. The \nnerve supply to the upper limbs is via the brachial plexus, \nwhich begins at the C5 level. The site of the spinal cord \ninjury is at or above the C5 level.\nIt is important to remember that although the cord has been \ntransected in the cervical region, the cord below this level is \nintact.

Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an \nenlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender \nto touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained \nof a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and \nblood, and she had a mild temperature.\nThe chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, \nwhich explains the pulmonary history.\nGiven the age of the patient a primary lung cancer is \nunlikely. The hemoptysis (coughing up blood in the sputum) \nand the rest of the history suggest the patient has a lung \ninfection. Given the chest radiographic findings of a cavity in \nthe apex of the lung, a diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) was \nmade. This was confirmed by bronchoscopy and aspiration \nof pus, which was cultured.\nDuring the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection, the tuberculous \nbacillus had spread via the blood to vertebra LI. The bone \ndestruction began in the cancellous bone of the vertebral body close to the intervertebral discs. This disease \nprogressed and eroded into the intervertebral disc, which \nbecame infected. The disc was destroyed, and the infected \ndisc material extruded around the disc anteriorly and passed \ninto the psoas muscle sheath. This is not an uncommon \nfinding for a tuberculous infection of the lumbar portion of \nthe vertebral column.\nAs the infection progressed, the pus spread within the psoas \nmuscle sheath beneath the inguinal ligament to produce a \nhard mass in the groin. This is a typical finding for a psoas \nabscess.\nFortunately for the patient, there was no evidence of any \ndamage within the vertebral canal.\nThe patient underwent a radiologically guided drainage of \nthe psoas abscess and was treated for over 6 months with a \nlong-term antibiotic regimen. She made an excellent \nrecovery with no further symptoms, although the cavities \nwithin the lungs remain. It healed with sclerosis.\nCase 4\nDISSECTING THORACIC ANEURYSM\nA 72-year-old fit and healthy man was brought to the \nemergency department with severe back pain beginning at \nthe level of the shoulder blades and extending to the \nmidlumbar region. The pain was of relatively acute onset \nand was continuous. The patient was able to walk to the \ngurney as he entered the ambulance; however, at the \nemergency department the patient complained of inability \nto use both legs.\nThe attending physician examined the back thoroughly and \nfound no significant abnormality. He noted that there was \nreduced sensation in both legs, and there was virtually no \npower in extensor or flexor groups. The patient was \ntachycardic, which was believed to be due to pain, and the \nblood pressure obtained in the ambulance measured \n120/80 mm Hg. It was noted that the patient\u2019s current blood \npressure was 80/40 mm Hg; however, the patient did not \ncomplain of typical clinical symptoms of hypotension.\nOn first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical \nsymptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive \nparaplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible \nwith the clinical state of the patient.\nIt was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were \nobtained in different arms, and both were reassessed.\nThe blood pressure measurements were true. In the right \narm the blood pressure measured 120/80 mm Hg and in the \nleft arm the blood pressure measured 80/40 mm Hg. This \nwould imply a deficiency of blood to the left arm.\nThe patient was transferred from the emergency department \nto the CT scanner, and a scan was performed that included \nthe chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\nThe CT scan demonstrated a dissecting thoracic aortic \naneurysm. Aortic dissection occurs when the tunica intima \nand part of the tunica media of the wall of the aorta become \nseparated from the remainder of the tunica media and the \ntunica adventitia of the aorta wall. This produces a false \nlumen. Blood passes not only in the true aortic lumen but \nalso through a small hole into the wall of the aorta and into \nthe false lumen. It often reenters the true aortic lumen \n(continues)"

The process of the aortic dissection produces \nconsiderable pain for the patient and is usually of rapid \nonset. Typically the pain is felt between the shoulder blades \nand radiating into the back, and although the pain is not \nfrom the back musculature or the vertebral column, careful \nconsideration of structures other than the back should \nalways be sought.\nThe difference in the blood pressure between the two arms \nindicates the level at which the dissection has begun. The \n\u201cpoint of entry\u201d is proximal to the left subclavian artery. At \nthis level a small flap has been created, which limits the \nblood flow to the left upper limb, giving the low blood \npressure recording. The brachiocephalic trunk has not been \naffected by the aortic dissection, and hence blood flow \nremains appropriate to the right upper limb.The paraplegia was caused by ischemia to the spinal cord.\nThe blood supply to the spinal cord is from a single anterior \nspinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries. These arteries \nare fed via segmental spinal arteries at every vertebral level. \nThere are a number of reinforcing arteries (segmental \nmedullary arteries) along the length of the spinal cord\u2014the \nlargest of which is the artery of Adamkiewicz. This artery of \nAdamkiewicz, a segmental medullary artery, typically arises \nfrom the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region, and \nunfortunately during this patient\u2019s aortic dissection, the \norigin of this vessel was disrupted. This produces acute \nspinal cord ischemia and has produced the paraplegia in the \npatient.\nUnfortunately, the dissection extended, the aorta ruptured, \nand the patient succumbed.\nCase 5\nSACRAL TUMOR\nA 55-year-old woman came to her physician with sensory \nalteration in the right gluteal (buttock) region and in the \nintergluteal (natal) cleft. Examination also demonstrated \nlow-grade weakness of the muscles of the foot and subtle \nweakness of the extensor hallucis longus, extensor \ndigitorum longus, and fibularis tertius on the right. The \npatient also complained of some mild pain symptoms \nposteriorly in the right gluteal region.\nA lesion was postulated in the left sacrum.\nPain in the right sacro-iliac region could easily be attributed \nto the sacro-iliac joint, which is often very sensitive to pain. \nThe weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the foot and the \nextensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and \nfibularis tertius muscles raises the possibility of an \nabnormality affecting the nerves exiting the sacrum and \npossibly the lumbosacral junction. The altered sensation \naround the gluteal region toward the anus would also \nsupport these anatomical localizing features.\nAn X-ray was obtained of the pelvis.\nThe X-ray appeared on first inspection unremarkable. \nHowever, the patient underwent further investigation, \nincluding CT and MRI, which demonstrated a large destructive lesion involving the whole of the left sacrum \nextending into the anterior sacral foramina at the S1, S2, and \nS3 levels. Interestingly, plain radiographs of the sacrum may \noften appear normal on first inspection, and further imaging \nshould always be sought in patients with a suspected sacral \nabnormality.\nThe lesion was expansile and lytic.\nMost bony metastases are typically nonexpansile. They may \nwell erode the bone, producing lytic type of lesions, or may \nbecome very sclerotic (prostate metastases and breast \nmetastases). From time to time we see a mixed pattern of \nlytic and sclerotic.\nThere are a number of uncommon instances in which certain \nmetastases are expansile and lytic. These typically occur in \nrenal metastases and may be seen in multiple myeloma. The \nanatomical importance of these specific tumors is that they \noften expand and impinge upon other structures. The \nexpansile nature of this patient\u2019s tumor within the sacrum \nwas the cause for compression of the sacral nerve roots, \nproducing her symptoms.\nThe patient underwent a course of radiotherapy, had the \nrenal tumor excised, and is currently undergoing a course of \nchemoimmunotherapy."

It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, major nerves, and major systemic blood vessels.\nThe pleural cavities are completely separated from each \nother by the mediastinum. Therefore abnormal events in one pleural cavity do not necessarily affect the other cavity . This also means that the mediastinum can be entered surgically without opening the pleural cavities.\nAnother important feature of  the pleural cavities is that \nthey extend above the level of  rib I. The apex of  each lung actually extends into the root of  the neck. As a conse -\nquence, abnormal events in the root of  the neck can involve the adjacent pleura and lung, and events in the adjacent pleura and lung can involve the root of  the neck.\nFUNCTIONS\nBreathing\nOne of  the most important functions of  the thorax is \nbreathing. The thorax not only contains the lungs but also provides the machinery necessary\u2014the diaphragm, tho-racic wall, and ribs\u2014for effectively moving air into and out of  the lungs.\nUp and down movements of  the diaphragm and  \nchanges in the lateral and anterior dimensions of  the  \nthoracic wall, caused by movements of  the ribs, alter  \nthe volume of  the thoracic cavity and are key elements  \nin breathing.\nProtection of vital organs\nThe thorax houses and protects the heart, lungs, and great vessels. Because of  the upward domed shape of  the dia -\nphragm, the thoracic wall also offers protection to some important abdominal viscera.\nMuch of  the liver lies under the right dome of  the dia -\nphragm, and the stomach and spleen lie under the left. The posterior aspects of  the superior poles of  the kidneys lie on the diaphragm and are anterior to rib XII, on the right, and to ribs XI and XII, on the left."

In addition, the thoracic wall protects the heart and lungs and provides support for the upper limbs. Muscles anchored to the anterior thoracic wall provide some of  this support, and together with their associated connective tissues, nerves, and vessels, and the overlying skin and superficial fascia, define the pectoral region.\nPECTORAL REGION\nThe pectoral region is external to the anterior thoracic wall and helps anchor the upper limb to the trunk. It consists of:\n\u25a0 a superficial compar tment containing skin, superficial \nfascia, and breasts; and\n\u25a0 a deep compar tment containing muscles and associated \nstructures.\nNerves, vessels, and lymphatics in the superficial com -\npartment emerge from the thoracic wall, the axilla, and  \nthe neck.\nBreast\nThe breasts consist of  mammary glands and associated \nskin and connective tissues. The mammary glands  \nare modified sweat glands in the superficial fascia anterior to the pectoral muscles and the anterior thoracic wall  \n(Fig. 3.16).\nThe mammary glands consist of  a series of  ducts and \nassociated secretory lobules. These converge to form 15 to 20 lactiferous ducts , which open independently onto the \nnipple. The nipple is surrounded by a circular pigmented area of  skin termed the areola.\nA well-developed, connective tissue stroma surrounds \nthe ducts and lobules of  the mammary gland. In certain regions, this condenses to form well-defined ligaments, the suspensory ligaments of  breast, which are continuous with the dermis of  the skin and support the breast. Carcinoma of  the breast creates tension on these ligaments, causing pitting of  the skin.\nIn nonlactating women, the predominant component \nof  the breasts is fat, while glandular tissue is more abun -\ndant in lactating women.\nThe breast lies on deep fascia related to the pectoralis \nmajor muscle and other surrounding muscles. A layer of  loose connective tissue (the retromammary space) sepa-\nrates the breast from the deep fascia and provides some degree of  movement over underlying structures.\nThe base, or attached surface, of  each breast extends \nvertically from ribs II to VI, and transversely from the sternum to as far laterally as the midaxillary line.\nArterial supply\nThe breast is related to the thoracic wall and to structures associated with the upper limb; therefore, vascular supply and drainage can occur by multiple routes (Fig. 3.16):\n\u25a0 la terally , vessels from the axillary artery\u2014superior \nthoracic, thoraco-acromial, lateral thoracic, and sub -\nscapular arteries;\n\u25a0 mediall y , branches from the internal thoracic artery;\n\u25a0 the second to four th intercostal arteries via branches \nthat perforate the thoracic wall and overlying muscle.\nVenous drainage\nVeins draining the breast parallel the arteries and ulti -\nmately drain into the axillary , internal thoracic, and intercostal veins.\nInnervation\nInnervation of  the breast is via anterior and lateral cutane -\nous branches of  the second to sixth intercostal nerves. The nipple is innervated by the fourth intercostal nerve.\nLymphatic drainage\nLymphatic drainage of  the breast is as follows:\n\u25a0 A pproximately 75% is via lymphatic vessels that drain \nlaterally and superiorly into axillary nodes (Fig. 3.16).\n\u25a0 Most of  the remaining drainage is into parasternal \nnodes deep to the anterior thoracic wall and associated with the internal thoracic artery .\n\u25a0 Some dr ainage may occur via lymphatic vessels that \nfollow the lateral branches of  posterior intercostal arter -\nies and connect with intercostal nodes situated near the heads and necks of  ribs."

Once confirmed, the clinician must attempt to \nstage the tumor.\nStaging the tumor  means defining the:\n\u25a0 size of the primary tumor,\n\u25a0 exact site of the primary tumor,\n\u25a0 number and sites of lymph node spread, and\n\u25a0 organs to which the tumor may have spread.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning of the body may be \ncarried out to look for any spread to the lungs (pulmonary \nmetastases), liver (hepatic metastases), or bone (bony \nmetastases).\nFurther imaging may include bone scanning using \nradioactive isotopes, which are avidly taken up by the tumor metastases in bone, and PET-CT, which can visualize active \nfoci of the metastatic disease in the body.\nLymph drainage of the breast is complex. Lymph vessels \npass to axillary, supraclavicular, and parasternal nodes and \nmay even pass to abdominal lymph nodes, as well as to the \nopposite breast. Containment of nodal metastatic breast \ncancer is therefore potentially difficult because it can spread \nthrough many lymph node groups.\nSubcutaneous lymphatic obstruction and tumor growth \npull on connective tissue ligaments in the breast, resulting in \nthe appearance of an orange peel texture ( peau d\u2019orange ) on \nthe surface of the breast. Further subcutaneous spread can \ninduce a rare manifestation of breast cancer that produces a \nhard, woody texture to the skin ( cancer en cuirasse ).\nA mastectomy (surgical removal of the breast) involves \nexcision of breast tissue. Within the axilla the breast tissue \nmust be removed from the medial axillary wall. Closely \napplied to the medial axillary wall is the long thoracic nerve. \nDamage to this nerve can result in paralysis of the serratus \nanterior muscle, producing a characteristic \u201cwinged\u201d scapula. \nIt is also possible to damage the nerve to the latissimus \ndorsi muscle, and this may affect extension, medial rotation, \nand adduction of the humerus."

The \nsecond to seventh joints are synovial and have thin cap-sules reinforced by surrounding sternocostal ligaments.\nThe joint between the second costal cartilage and the \nsternum is divided into two compartments by an intra -\narticular ligament. This ligament attaches the second costal cartilage to the junction of  the manubrium and the body of  the sternum.\nInterchondral joints\nInterchondral joints occur between the costal cartilages of  adjacent ribs (Fig. 3.25), mainly between the costal carti -\nlages of  ribs VII to X, but may also involve the costal carti -\nlages of  ribs V and VI.\nInterchondral joints provide indirect anchorage to the \nsternum and contribute to the formation of  a smooth infe-rior costal margin. They are usually synovial, and the thin fibrous capsules are reinforced by interchondral ligaments.\nManubriosternal and xiphisternal joints\nThe joints between the manubrium and the body of  the sternum and between the body of  the sternum and the xiphoid process are usually symphyses (Fig. 3.25). Only slight angular movements occur between the manubrium and the body of  the sternum during respiration. The joint between the body of  the sternum and the xiphoid process often becomes ossified with age.\nA clinically useful feature of  the manubriosternal joint \nis that it can be palpated easily . This is because the manu -\nbrium normally angles posteriorly on the body of  the sternum, forming a raised feature referred to as the sternal angle. This elevation marks the site of  articulation of  rib II with the sternum. Rib I is not palpable, because it lies inferior to the clavicle and is embedded in tissues at the base of  the neck. Therefore, rib II is used as a reference for counting ribs and can be felt immediately lateral to the sternal angle.\nIn addition, the sternal angle lies on a horizontal plane \nthat passes through the intervertebral disc between verte-brae TIV and TV (see Fig. 3.10). This plane separates the superior mediastinum from the inferior mediastinum and marks the superior border of  the pericardium. The plane also passes through the end of  the ascending aorta and the beginning of  the arch of  the aorta, the end of  the arch of  the aorta and the beginning of  the thoracic aorta, and the bifurcation of  the trachea, and just superior to the pulmo -\nnary trunk (see Fig. 3.79 and 3.86).\nIntercostal spaces\nIntercostal spaces lie between adjacent ribs and are filled by intercostal muscles (Fig. 3.26).Intercostal nerves and associated major arteries and \nveins lie in the costal groove along the inferior margin of  \nthe superior rib and pass in the plane between the inner two layers of  muscles.\nIn each space, the vein is the most superior structure \nand is therefore highest in the costal groove. The artery is inferior to the vein, and the nerve is inferior to the artery and often not protected by the groove. Therefore, the nerve is the structure most at risk when objects  \nperforate the upper aspect of  an intercostal space.  \nSmall collateral branches of  the major intercostal nerves and vessels are often present superior to the inferior  \nrib below .\nDeep to the intercostal spaces and ribs, and separating \nthese structures from the underlying pleura, is a layer of  loose connective tissue, called endothoracic fascia, \nwhich contains variable amounts of  fat.\nSuperficial to the spaces are deep fascia, superficial \nfascia, and skin. Muscles associated with the upper limbs and back overlie the spaces.\nIn the clinic\nCervical ribs\nCervical ribs are present in approximately 1% of the \npopulation.\nA cervical rib is an accessory rib articulating with \nvertebra CVII; the anterior end attaches to the superior border of the anterior aspect of rib I.\nPlain radiographs may demonstrate cervical ribs as \nsmall horn-like structures (see Fig. 3.106).\nIt is often not appreciated by clinicians that a fibrous \nband commonly extends from the anterior tip of the small cervical ribs to rib I, producing a \u201ccervical band\u201d that is not visualized on radiography. In patients with cervical ribs and cervical bands, structures that normally pass over rib I \n(see Fig. 3.7) are elevated by, and pass over, the cervical \nrib and band.\nClinically, \u201cthoracic outlet syndrome\u201d is used to \ndescribe symptoms resulting from abnormal  \ncompression of the brachial plexus of nerves as it passes \nover the first rib and through the axillary inlet into the \nupper limb. The anterior ramus of T1 passes superiorly  \nout of the superior thoracic aperture to join and become part of the brachial plexus. The cervical band from a cervical rib is one cause of thoracic outlet syndrome by \nputting upward stresses on the lower parts of the brachial \nplexus as they pass over the cervical band and related cervical rib."

It passes anteriorly over the cervical dome of  the pleura and descends vertically through the superior thoracic aperture and along the deep aspect of  the anterior thoracic wall. On each side, the internal thoracic artery lies posterior to the \ncostal cartilages of  the upper six ribs and about 1  cm lateral \nto the sternum. At approximately the level of  the sixth intercostal space, it divides into two terminal branches:\n\u25a0 the superior epigastric artery , which continues \ninferiorly into the anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 3.29); and\n\u25a0 the musculophrenic artery, which passes along the \ncostal margin, goes through the diaphragm, and ends near the last intercostal space.\nAnterior intercostal arteries that supply the upper six \nintercostal spaces arise as lateral branches from the internal thoracic artery , whereas those supplying the lower \nspaces arise from the musculophrenic artery .\nIn each intercostal space, the anterior intercostal arter -\nies usually have two branches:\n\u25a0 One passes belo w the margin of  the upper rib.\n\u25a0 The other passes a bove the margin of  the lower rib and \nmeets a collateral branch of  the posterior intercostal artery .\nThe distributions of  the anterior and posterior intercos -\ntal vessels overlap and can develop anastomotic connec-\ntions. The anterior intercostal arteries are generally smaller than the posterior vessels.\nIn addition to anterior intercostal arteries and a number \nof  other branches, the internal thoracic arteries give rise to perforating branches that pass directly forward between the costal cartilages to supply structures external to the thoracic wall. These vessels travel with the anterior cutane -\nous branches of  the intercostal nerves.\nVenous drainage\nVenous drainage from the thoracic wall generally parallels the pattern of  arterial supply (Fig. 3.30).\nCentrally , the intercostal veins ultimately drain into  \nthe azygos system of  veins or into internal thoracic \nveins, which connect with the brachiocephalic veins in  \nthe neck.\nOften the upper posterior intercostal veins on the  \nleft side come together and form the left superior  \nintercostal vein, which empties into the left brachioce -\nphalic vein.\nSimilarly , the upper posterior intercostal veins on the \nright side may come together and form the right superior \nintercostal vein, which empties into the azygos vein."

This procedure is done for pneumothorax, \nhemothorax, hemopneumothorax, malignant pleural \neffusion empyema, hydrothorax, and chylothorax, and \nalso after thoracic surgery.\nThe position of the thoracostomy tube is usually \nbetween the anterior axillary and midaxillary anatomical \nlines from anterior to posterior and in either the fourth or \nfifth intercostal space. The position of the ribs in this \nregion should be clearly marked. Anesthetic should be \napplied to the superior border of the rib and the inferior \naspect of the intercostal space, including one rib and space \nabove and one rib and space below. The neurovascular \nbundle runs in the neurovascular plane, which lies in the \nsuperior aspect of the intercostal space (just below the \nrib); hence, the reason for positioning the tube on the \nsuperior border of a rib (i.e., at the lowest position in the \nintercostal space).\nChest tube insertion is now commonly done with \ndirect ultrasound guidance. This approach allows the \nphysician both to assess whether the pleural effusion is \nsimple or complex and loculated, and to select the safest \nsite for entering the pleural space.

Typically, under ultrasound guidance, a \nneedle may be advanced into the region of the subcostal \ngroove, followed by an injection with a local anesthetic. \nDepending on the type of anesthetic used, analgesia may \nbe short- or long-acting.\nGiven the position of the neurovascular bundle and the \nsubcostal groove, complications may include puncture of \nthe parietal pleura and an ensuing pneumothorax. \nBleeding may also occur if the artery or vein is damaged \nduring the procedure.incision starts at the anterior axillary line and then passes \nbelow the tip of the scapula and is extended superiorly \nbetween the posterior midline and medial border of the \nscapula.

The greater, lesser, and least splanch -\nnic nerves penetrate the crura.\nArterial supply\nThe arterial supply to the diaphragm is from vessels that \narise superiorly and inferiorly to it (see Fig. 3.34). From \nabove, pericardiacophrenic and musculophrenic arteries supply the diaphragm. These vessels are branches of  the internal thoracic arteries. Superior phrenic arteries, which arise directly from lower parts of  the thoracic  \naorta, and small branches from intercostal arteries con -\ntribute to the supply . The largest arteries supplying the diaphragm arise from below it. These arteries are the inferior phrenic arteries , which branch directly from \nthe abdominal aorta.\nVenous drainage\nVenous drainage of  the diaphragm is by veins that gener -\nally parallel the arteries. The veins drain into:\n\u25a0 the br achiocephalic veins in the neck,\n\u25a0 the azygos system of  veins , or\n\u25a0 a bdominal veins (left suprarenal vein and inferior vena \ncava).\nInnervation\nThe diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerves (C3, \nC4, and C5), which penetrate the diaphragm and innervate it from its abdominal surface.Contraction of  the domes of  the diaphragm flattens \nthe diaphragm, thereby increasing thoracic volume. Movements of  the diaphragm are essential for normal  \nbreathing.\nMOVEMENTS OF THE THORACIC WALL  \nAND DIAPHRAGM DURING BREATHING\nOne of  the principal functions of  the thoracic wall and the diaphragm is to alter the volume of  the thorax and thereby move air in and out of  the lungs.\nDuring breathing, the dimensions of  the thorax change \nin the vertical, lateral, and anteroposterior directions.  \nElevation and depression of  the diaphragm significantly alter the vertical dimensions of  the thorax. Depression results when the muscle fibers of  the diaphragm contract. Elevation occurs when the diaphragm relaxes.\nChanges in the anteroposterior and lateral dimensions \nresult from elevation and depression of  the ribs (Fig. 3.35). The posterior ends of  the ribs articulate with the vertebral column, whereas the anterior ends of  most ribs articulate with the sternum or adjacent ribs.\nBecause the anterior ends of  the ribs are inferior to the \nposterior ends, when the ribs are elevated, they move the sternum upward and forward. Also, the angle between  \nthe body of  the sternum and the manubrium may become slightly less acute. When the ribs are depressed, the sternum moves downward and backward. This \u201cpump handle\u201d movement changes the dimensions of  the thorax in the anteroposterior direction (Fig. 3.35A).\nAs well as the anterior ends of  the ribs being lower than \nthe posterior ends, the middles of  the shafts tend to be lower than the two ends. When the shafts are elevated, the middles of  the shafts move laterally . This \u201cbucket handle\u201d movement increases the lateral dimensions of  the thorax (Fig. 3.35B).\nAny muscles attaching to the ribs can potentially move \none rib relative to another and therefore act as accessory respiratory muscles. Muscles in the neck and the abdomen can fix or alter the positions of  upper and lower ribs."

This connective tissue membrane is \nattached laterally to the medial margin of  the first rib and behind to the transverse process of  vertebra CVII. Superi -\norly , the membrane receives muscle fibers from some of  the deep muscles in the neck (scalene muscles) that function to keep the membrane taut. The suprapleural membrane provides apical support for the pleural cavity in the root of  the neck.\nIn the region of  vertebrae TV to TVII, the mediastinal \npleura reflects off  the mediastinum as a tubular, sleeve-like covering for structures (i.e., airway , vessels, nerves, lym -\nphatics) that pass between the lung and mediastinum. This sleeve-like covering and the structures it contains forms the root of  the lung . The root joins the medial surface  \nof  the lung at an area referred to as the hilum of  the \nlung. Here, the mediastinal pleura is continuous with the visceral pleura.\nThe parietal pleural is innervated by somatic afferent \nfibers. The costal pleura is innervated by branches from the intercostal nerves, and pain would be felt in relation to the thoracic wall. The diaphragmatic pleura and the mediasti-nal pleura are innervated mainly by the phrenic nerves (originating at spinal cord levels C3, C4, and C5). Pain from these areas would refer to the C3, C4, and C5 dermatomes (lateral neck and the supraclavicular region of  the shoulder).\nPeripheral reflections\nThe peripheral reflections of  parietal pleura mark the extent of  the pleural cavities (Fig. 3.39).\nSuperiorly , the pleural cavity can project as much as \n3 to 4  cm a bove the first costal cartilage but does not \nextend above the neck of  rib I. This limitation is caused by the inferior slope of  rib I to its articulation with the  \nmanubrium.\nAnteriorly , the pleural cavities approach each other \nposterior to the upper part of  the sternum. However, posterior to the lower part of  the sternum, the parietal pleura does not come as close to the midline on the left side as it does on the right because the middle media -\nstinum, containing the pericardium and heart, bulges to  \nthe left.\nInferiorly , the costal pleura reflects onto the diaphragm \nabove the costal margin. In the midclavicular line, the pleural cavity extends inferiorly to approximately rib VIII. In the midaxillary line, it extends to rib X. From this point, the inferior margin courses somewhat horizontally , cross-ing ribs XI and XII to reach vertebra TXII. From the midclavicular line to the vertebral column, the inferior boundary of  the pleura can be approximated by a line that runs between rib VIII, rib X, and vertebra TXII.\nVisceral pleura\nThe visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura at the hilum of  each lung, where structures enter and leave the organ. The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of  the lung, including both opposed surfaces of  the fissures that divide the lungs into lobes.\nAlthough the visceral pleura is innervated by visceral \nafferent nerves that accompany bronchial vessels, pain is generally not elicited from this tissue.\nPleural recesses\nThe lungs do not completely fill the anterior or posterior inferior regions of  the pleural cavities (Fig. 3.40). This results in recesses in which two layers of  parietal pleura become opposed. Expansion of  the lungs into these spaces usually occurs only during forced inspiration; the recesses also provide potential spaces in which fluids can collect and from which fluids can be aspirated."

Air enters and leaves the lungs via main bronchi, which are branches of  the trachea.\nThe pulmonary arteries deliver deoxygenated blood  \nto the lungs from the right ventricle of  the heart. Oxygen -\nated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins.\nThe right lung is normally a little larger than the left \nlung because the middle mediastinum, containing the heart, bulges more to the left than to the right.\nEach lung has a half-cone shape, with a base, apex, two \nsurfaces, and three borders (Fig. 3.43).\n\u25a0 The base sits on the diaphragm.\n\u25a0 The apex projects above rib I and into the root of   \nthe neck.\n\u25a0 The tw o surfaces\u2014the costal surface lies immediately \nadjacent to the ribs and intercostal spaces of  the  \nthoracic wall. The mediastinal surface lies against \nthe mediastinum anteriorly and the vertebral column posteriorly and contains the comma-shaped hilum  \nof  the lung, through which structures enter and  \nleave.\n\u25a0 The three border s\u2014the inferior border of  the lung is \nsharp and separates the base from the costal surface. The anterior and posterior borders separate the \ncostal surface from the medial surface. Unlike the ante-rior and inferior borders, which are sharp, the posterior border is smooth and rounded.\nThe lungs lie directly adjacent to, and are indented by , \nstructures contained in the overlying area. The heart and \nmajor vessels form bulges in the mediastinum that indent the medial surfaces of  the lung; the ribs indent the costal surfaces. Pathology , such as tumors, or abnormalities in one structure can affect the related structure.\nRoot and hilum\nThe root of  each lung is a short tubular collection of  \nstructures that together attach the lung to structures in the mediastinum (Fig. 3.44). It is covered by a sleeve of  medi -\nastinal pleura that reflects onto the surface of  the lung as visceral pleura. The region outlined by this pleural reflec -\ntion on the medial surface of  the lung is the hilum, where \nstructures enter and leave.\nA thin blade-like fold of  pleura projects inferiorly from \nthe root of  the lung and extends from the hilum to the mediastinum. This structure is the pulmonary ligament. It may stabilize the position of  the inferior lobe and may also accommodate the down-and-up translocation of  structures in the root during breathing.\nIn the mediastinum, the vagus nerves pass immediately \nposterior to the roots of  the lungs, while the phrenic nerves pass immediately anterior to them.\nWithin each root and located in the hilum are:\n\u25a0 a pulmonar y artery ,\n\u25a0 tw o pulmonary veins,\n\u25a0 a main bronchus,\n\u25a0 bronchial v essels,\n\u25a0 ner ves, and\n\u25a0 lymphatics.\nGenerally , the pulmonary artery is superior at the hilum, \nthe pulmonary veins are inferior, and the bronchi are somewhat posterior in position.\nOn the right side, the lobar bronchus to the superior lobe \nbranches from the main bronchus in the root, unlike on the left where it branches within the lung itself, and is superior to the pulmonary artery .\nRight lung\nThe right lung has three lobes and two fissures (Fig. \n3.45A). Normally , the lobes are freely movable against each other because they are separated, almost to the hilum, by invaginations of  visceral pleura. These invaginations form the fissures:\n\u25a0 The oblique fissure separates the inferior lobe \n(lower lobe) from the superior lobe and the middle \nlobe of  the right lung .\n\u25a0 The horizontal fissure separates the superior lobe \n(upper lobe ) from the middle lobe.\nThe approximate position of  the oblique fissure on a \npatient, in quiet respiration, can be marked by a curved line on the thoracic wall that begins roughly at the spinous process of  the vertebra TIV level of  the spine, crosses the fifth interspace laterally , and then follows the contour of  rib VI anteriorly (see pp. 241\u2013242).\nThe horizontal fissure follows the fourth intercostal \nspace from the sternum until it meets the oblique fissure as it crosses rib V .\nThe orientations of  the oblique and horizontal fissures \ndetermine where clinicians should listen for lung sounds from each lobe.\nThe largest surface of  the superior lobe is in contact \nwith the upper part of  the anterolateral wall and the apex of  this lobe projects into the root of  the neck. The surface of  the middle lobe lies mainly adjacent to the lower anterior"

The trachea is held open by C-shaped transverse cartilage rings embedded in its wall\u2014the open part of  the C facing posteriorly . The lowest tracheal \nring has a hook-shaped structure, the carina, that projects backward in the midline between the origins of  the two main bronchi. The posterior wall of  the trachea is com -\nposed mainly of  smooth muscle.\nEach main bronchus enters the root of  a lung and \npasses through the hilum into the lung itself. The right \nmain bronchus is wider and takes a more vertical course through the root and hilum than the left main bronchus (Fig. 3.47A). Therefore, inhaled foreign bodies tend to lodge more frequently on the right side than on  \nthe left.\nThe main bronchus divides within the lung into lobar \nbronchi (secondary bronchi), each of  which supplies a lobe. On the right side, the lobar bronchus to the superior lobe originates within the root of  the lung.\nThe lobar bronchi further divide into segmental \nbronchi (tertiary bronchi), which supply bronchopulmo-nary segments (Fig. 3.47B).\nWithin each bronchopulmonary segment, the segmen-\ntal bronchi give rise to multiple generations of  divisions and, ultimately , to bronchioles, which further subdivide and supply the respiratory surfaces. The walls of  the bronchi are held open by discontinuous elongated plates of  cartilage, but these are not present in bronchioles.\nBronchopulmonary segments\nA bronchopulmonary segment is the area of  lung  \nsupplied by a segmental bronchus and its accompanying pulmonary artery branch.\nTributaries of  the pulmonary vein tend to pass interseg -\nmentally between and around the margins of  segments.and lateral wall. The costal surface of  the inferior lobe is in contact with the posterior and inferior walls.\nWhen listening to lung sounds from each of  the lobes, \nit is important to position the stethoscope on those areas of  the thoracic wall related to the underlying positions of  the lobes (see p. 243).\nThe medial surface of  the right lung lies adjacent to a \nnumber of  important structures in the mediastinum and the root of  the neck (Fig. 3.45B). These include the:\n\u25a0 heart,\n\u25a0 inf erior vena cava,\n\u25a0 superior v ena cava,\n\u25a0 azy gos vein, and\n\u25a0 esophagus.\nThe right subclavian artery and vein arch over and \nare related to the superior lobe of  the right lung as they pass over the dome of  the cervical pleura and into the  \naxilla.\nLeft lung\nThe left lung is smaller than the right lung and has two \nlobes separated by an oblique fissure (Fig. 3.46A). The oblique fissure of  the left lung is slightly more oblique than the corresponding fissure of  the right lung.\nDuring quiet respiration, the approximate position of  \nthe left oblique fissure can be marked by a curved line  \non the thoracic wall that begins between the spinous  \nprocesses of  vertebrae TIII and TIV , crosses the fifth inter -\nspace laterally , and follows the contour of  rib VI anteriorly (see pp. 241\u2013242).\nAs with the right lung, the orientation of  the oblique \nfissure determines where to listen for lung sounds from each lobe.\nThe largest surface of  the superior lobe is in contact \nwith the upper part of  the anterolateral wall, and the apex of  this lobe projects into the root of  the neck. The costal surface of  the inferior lobe is in contact with the posterior and inferior walls.\nWhen listening to lung sounds from each of  the lobes, \nthe stethoscope should be placed on those areas of  the thoracic wall related to the underlying positions of  the lobes (see p. 243).\nThe inferior portion of  the medial surface of  the left \nlung, unlike the right lung, is notched because of  the heart\u2019s projection into the left pleural cavity from the middle mediastinum.\nFrom the anterior border of  the lower part of  the supe -\nrior lobe a tongue-like extension (the lingula of  the left \nlung) projects over the heart bulge."

Unfortunately, many patients present with a tumor mass that has invaded structures in the mediastinum or the pleurae or has metastasized. The tumor may then be inoperable and is treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nSpread of the tumor is by lymphatics to lymph nodes \nwithin the hila, mediastinum, and root of the neck.A key factor affecting the prognosis and ability to cure \nthe disease is the distant spread of metastases. Imaging \nmethods to assess spread include plain radiography (Fig. \n3.54A), computed tomography (CT; Fig. 3.54B,C), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Increasingly, radionuclide studies using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET; Fig. 3.54D) are being used.\nIn FDG PET a gamma radiation emitter is attached to a \nglucose molecule. In areas of high metabolic activity (i.e., the tumor), excessive uptake occurs and is recorded by a gamma camera.In the clinic\nBronchoscopy\nPatients who have an endobronchial lesion (i.e.,  \na lesion within a bronchus) may undergo bronchoscopic evaluation of the trachea and its main branches (Fig. 3.53). \nThe bronchoscope is passed through the nose into the \noropharynx and is then directed by a control system past the vocal cords into the trachea. The bronchi are inspected and, if necessary, small biopsies are obtained. Bronchoscopy can also be used in combination with ultrasound (a technique known as EBUS, endobronchial ultrasound). An ultrasound \nprobe is inserted through a working channel of the \nbronchoscope to visualize the airway walls and adjacent structures. EBUS allows an accurate localization of the lesion and therefore provides a higher diagnostic yield. It can be used for sampling of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes or \nto assist in transbronchial biopsy of pulmonary nodules.\nRight main bronchus Carina\nLeft main bronchusTumorRight main bronchus\nAB\nFig. 3.53  Br onchoscopic evaluation.

As in patients with myocardial infarction, patients with pericarditis complain of continuous central chest pain that may radiate to one or both arms. Unlike myocardial infarction, however, the pain from pericarditis may be relieved by sitting forward. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is \nused to help differentiate between the two conditions. It \nusually shows diffuse ST elevation. Echocardiography can also be performed if there is clinical or radiographic suspicion of pericardial effusion.\nIn the clinic\nConstrictive pericarditis\nAbnormal thickening of the pericardial sac (constrictive pericarditis), which usually involves only the parietal pericardium, but can also less frequently involve the \nvisceral layer, can compress the heart, impairing heart \nfunction and resulting in heart failure. It can present acutely but often results in a chronic condition when thickened pericardium with fibrin deposits causes pericardial inflammation, leading to chronic scarring and \npericardial calcification. As a result, normal filling during \nthe diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle is severely restricted. The diagnosis is made by inspecting the jugular venous pulse in the neck. In normal individuals, the \njugular venous pulse drops on inspiration. In patients with \nconstrictive pericarditis, the reverse happens and this is called Kussmaul\u2019s sign. Treatment often involves surgical opening of the pericardial sac.In the clinic\nPericardial effusion\nNormally, only a tiny amount of fluid is present between the visceral and parietal layers of the serous pericardium. In certain situations, this space can be filled with excess \nfluid (pericardial effusion) (Fig. 3.62).\nBecause the fibrous pericardium is a \u201crelatively fixed\u201d \nstructure that cannot expand easily, a rapid accumulation \nof excess fluid within the pericardial sac compresses the heart (cardiac tamponade), resulting in biventricular failure. \nRemoving the fluid with a needle inserted into the \npericardial sac can relieve the symptoms.\nFig. 3.62  Coronal CT showing pericardial effusion. \nLiver\nStomachPericardial\neffusionRight lungPulmonary trunk Ascending aorta\nLeft lung"

Most of  these are either \nattached to the ventricular walls throughout their length, forming ridges, or attached at both ends, forming bridges.\nA few trabeculae carneae ( papillary muscles ) have \nonly one end attached to the ventricular surface, while the other end serves as the point of  attachment for tendon-like fibrous cords (the chordae tendineae), which connect to \nthe free edges of  the cusps of  the tricuspid valve.\nThere are three papillary muscles in the right ventricle. \nNamed relative to their point of  origin on the ventricular surface, they are the anterior, posterior, and septal papil -\nlary muscles:\n\u25a0 The anterior papillary muscle  is the largest and most \nconstant papillary muscle, and arises from the anterior wall of  the ventricle.\n\u25a0 The posterior papillary muscle may consist of  one, \ntwo, or three structures, with some chordae tendineae arising directly from the ventricular wall.\n\u25a0 The septal papillary muscle is the most inconsistent \npapillary muscle, being either small or absent,  \nwith chordae tendineae emerging directly from the  \nseptal wall.\nA single specialized trabeculum, the septomarginal \ntrabecula (moderator band), forms a bridge between \nthe lower portion of  the interventricular septum and \nthe base of  the anterior papillary muscle. The septomar -\nginal trabecula carries a portion of  the cardiac conduction system, the right bundle of  the atrioventricular bundle, to the anterior wall of  the right ventricle.\nTricuspid valve\nThe right atrioventricular orifice is closed during ventricu -\nlar contraction by the tricuspid valve (right atrioven-\ntricular valve), so named because it usually consists of  three cusps or leaflets (Fig. 3.71). The base of  each cusp is secured to the fibrous ring that surrounds the atrioven -\ntricular orifice. This fibrous ring helps to maintain the shape of  the opening. The cusps are continuous with each other near their bases at sites termed commissures.\nThe naming of  the three cusps, the anterior, septal, \nand posterior cusps, is based on their relative position in \nthe right ventricle. The free margins of  the cusps are attached to the chordae tendineae, which arise from the tips of  the papillary muscles.\nDuring filling of  the right ventricle, the tricuspid  \nvalve is open, and the three cusps project into the right ventricle.\nWithout the presence of  a compensating mechanism, \nwhen the ventricular musculature contracts, the valve cusps would be forced upward with the flow of  blood and The space anterior to the crista, including the right \nauricle, is sometimes referred to as the atrium proper. \nThis terminology is based on its origin from the embryonic primitive atrium. Its walls are covered by ridges called the musculi pectinati (pectinate muscles), which fan out from the crista like the \u201cteeth of  a comb.\u201d These ridges  \nare also found in the right auricle, which is an ear-like, conical, muscular pouch that externally overlaps the ascending aorta.\nAn additional structure in the right atrium is the \nopening of  the coronary sinus , which receives blood \nfrom most of  the cardiac veins and opens medially to the opening of  the inferior vena cava . Associated with \nthese openings are small folds of  tissue derived from the valve of  the embryonic sinus venosus (the valve of  the \ncoronary sinus and the valve of  inferior vena cava , \nrespectively). During development, the valve of  the inferior vena cava helps direct incoming oxygenated blood through the foramen ovale and into the left atrium.\nSeparating the right atrium from the left atrium is the \ninteratrial septum, which faces forward and to the right because the left atrium lies posteriorly and to the left of  the right atrium. A depression is clearly visible in the septum just above the orifice of  the inferior vena cava. This is the fossa ovalis (oval fossa), with its prominent margin, the limbus fossa ovalis (border of  the oval fossa ).\nThe fossa ovalis marks the location of  the embryonic \nforamen ovale, which is an important part of  fetal circu -\nlation. The foramen ovale allows oxygenated blood enter -\ning the right atrium through the inferior vena cava to pass directly to the left atrium and so bypass the lungs, which are nonfunctional before birth.\nFinally , numerous small openings\u2014the openings of  \nthe smallest cardiac veins (the foramina of  the venae \ncordis minimae)\u2014are scattered along the walls of  the right atrium. These are small veins that drain the myocar -\ndium directly into the right atrium.\nRight ventricle\nIn the anatomical position, the right ventricle forms most of  the anterior surface of  the heart and a portion of  the diaphragmatic surface. The right atrium is to the right of  the right ventricle and the right ventricle is located in front of  and to the left of  the right atrioventricular orifice. Blood entering the right ventricle from the right atrium therefore moves in a horizontal and forward direction.\nThe outflow tract of  the right ventricle, which leads to \nthe pulmonary trunk, is the conus arteriosus\n (infun-\ndibulum). This area has smooth walls and derives from the embryonic bulbus cordis.\nThe walls of  the inflow portion of  the right ventricle \nhave numerous muscular, irregular structures called"

The thin area or depression in the septum is  \nthe valve of  the foramen ovale and is opposite the floor of  \nthe fossa ovalis in the right atrium.\nDuring development, the valve of  the foramen ovale \nprevents blood from passing from the left atrium to the right atrium.

The chamber itself  is conical, is longer than the right ventricle, and has the thickest layer of  myocardium. The outflow tract (the aortic vestibule) is posterior to the \ninfundibulum of  the right ventricle, has smooth walls, and is derived from the embryonic bulbus cordis.\nThe trabeculae carneae  in the left ventricle are fine \nand delicate in contrast to those in the right ventricle.  \nThe general appearance of  the trabeculae with muscular ridges and bridges is similar to that of  the right ventricle (Fig. 3.74).\nPapillary muscles, together with chordae tendineae, are \nalso observed and their structure is as described above for the right ventricle. Two papillary muscles, the anterior \nand posterior papillary muscles, are usually found in \nthe left ventricle and are larger than those of  the right ventricle.\nIn the anatomical position, the left ventricle is somewhat \nposterior to the right ventricle. The interventricular septum therefore forms the anterior wall and some of  the wall on the right side of  the left ventricle. The septum is described as having two parts:\n\u25a0 a muscular part, and\n\u25a0 a membranous part.\nThe muscular part is thick and forms the major part of  \nthe septum, whereas the membranous part is the thin, upper part of  the septum. A third part of  the septum may be considered an atrioventricular part because of  its posi -\ntion above the septal cusp of  the tricuspid valve. This superior location places this part of  the septum between the left ventricle and right atrium.\nMitral valve\nThe left atrioventricular orifice opens into the posterior right side of  the superior part of  the left ventricle. It is closed during ventricular contraction by the mitral valve \n(left atrioventricular valve), which is also referred to as the bicuspid valve because it has two cusps, the ante-\nrior and posterior cusps (Fig. 3.74). The bases of  the cusps are secured to a fibrous ring surrounding the opening, and the cusps are continuous with each other at the commissures.

The four rings of  the cardiac skeleton surround the two atrio -\nventricular orifices, the aortic orifice and opening of  the pulmonary trunks. They are the anulus fibrosus. The \ninterconnecting areas include:\n\u25a0 the right fibrous trigone , which is a thickened area of  \nconnective tissue between the aortic ring and right atrioventricular ring; andIn the clinic\nValve disease\nValve problems consist of two basic types:\n\u25a0 inc ompetence (insufficiency), which results from poorly \nfunctioning valves; and\n\u25a0 st enosis, a narrowing of the orifice, caused by the \nvalve\u2019s inability to open fully.\nMitral valve disease is usually a mixed pattern of \nstenosis and incompetence, one of which usually \npredominates. Both stenosis and incompetence lead to a poorly functioning valve and subsequent heart changes, which include:\n\u25a0 le ft ventricular hypertrophy (this is appreciably less \nmarked in patients with mitral stenosis);\n\u25a0 incr eased pulmonary venous pressure;\n\u25a0 pulmonary edema; and\n\u25a0 enlar gement (dilation) and hypertrophy of the left \natrium.\nMitral valve stenosis can be congenital or acquired; in \nthe latter, the most common cause is rheumatic fever. \nStenosis usually occurs decades after an acute episode of rheumatic endocarditis.\nAortic valve disease , both aortic stenosis and aortic \nregurgitation (backflow), can produce marked heart failure. \nAortic valve stenosis is the most common type of cardiac \nvalve disease and results from atherosclerosis causing calcification of the valve leaflets. It can also be caused by postinflammatory or postrheumatic conditions. These may lead to aortic regurgitation such as infective endocarditis, \ndegenerative valve disease, rheumatic fever, or trauma.\nValve disease in the right side of the heart  (affecting \nthe tricuspid or pulmonary valve ) is most likely caused by \ninfection. Intravenous drug use, alcoholism, indwelling \ncatheters, and extensive burns predispose to infection of \nthe valves, particularly the tricuspid valve. The resulting \nvalve dysfunction produces abnormal pressure changes in the right atrium and right ventricle, and these can induce cardiac failure.\u25a0 the left fibrous trigone, which is a thickened area of  \nconnective tissue between the aortic ring and the left \natrioventricular ring (Fig. 3.76).\nThe cardiac skeleton helps maintain the integrity of  the \nopenings it surrounds and provides points of  attachment \nfor the cusps. It also separates the atrial musculature from the ventricular musculature. The atrial myocardium origi -\nnates from the upper border of  the rings, whereas the ventricular myocardium originates from the lower border of  the rings.\nThe cardiac skeleton also serves as a dense connective \ntissue partition that electrically isolates the atria from  \nthe ventricles. The atrioventricular bundle, which passes through the anulus, is the single connection between these two groups of  myocardium.\nCoronary vasculature\nTwo coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses in the initial portion of  the ascending aorta and supply the muscle and other tissues of  the heart. They circle the heart in the coronary sulcus, with marginal and interventricular branches, in the interventricular sulci, converging toward the apex of  the heart (Fig. 3.77).\nThe returning venous blood passes through cardiac \nveins, most of  which empty into the coronary sinus. This large venous structure is located in the coronary sulcus on the posterior surface of  the heart between the left atrium and left ventricle. The coronary sinus empties into the right atrium between the opening of  the inferior vena cava and the right atrioventricular orifice.\nCoronary arteries\nRight coronary artery.  The right coronary artery originates \nfrom the right aortic sinus of  the ascending aorta. It passes anteriorly and then descends vertically in the coronary sulcus, between the right atrium and right ventricle (Fig. 3.78A).

During this course, several branches arise from the main stem of  the vessel:\n\u25a0 An earl y atrial branch passes in the groove between \nthe right auricle and ascending aorta, and gives off   \nthe sinu-atrial nodal branch (Fig. 3.78A), which \npasses posteriorly around the superior vena cava to supply the sinu-atrial node.\n\u25a0 A right marginal branch  is given off  as the right coro -\nnary artery approaches the inferior (acute) margin of  the heart (Fig. 3.78A,B) and continues along this border toward the apex of  the heart."

The most common \ncause is a total occlusion of a major coronary artery.\nCoronary artery disease\nOcclusion of a major coronary artery, usually due to \natherosclerosis, leads to inadequate oxygenation of an area of myocardium and cell death (Fig. 3.80). The severity of the \nproblem will be related to the size and location of the artery \ninvolved, whether or not the blockage is complete, and whether there are collateral vessels to provide perfusion  \nto the territory from other vessels. Depending on the severity, patients can develop pain (angina) or a myocardial \ninfarction (MI).\nPercutaneous coronary intervention\nThis is a technique in which a long fine tube (a catheter) is \ninserted into the femoral artery in the thigh and passed through the external and common iliac arteries and into the abdominal aorta. It continues to be moved upward through the thoracic aorta to the origins of the coronary arteries. The coronaries may also be approached via the radial or brachial arteries. A fine wire is then passed into the coronary artery \nand is used to cross the stenosis. A fine balloon is then \npassed over the wire and may be inflated at the level of the obstruction, thus widening it; this is termed angioplasty. More commonly, this is augmented by placement of a fine wire mesh (a stent) inside the obstruction to hold it open. \nOther percutaneous interventions are suction extraction of a \ncoronary thrombus and rotary ablation of a plaque.\nCoronary artery bypass grafts\nIf coronary artery disease is too extensive to be treated  \nby percutaneous intervention, surgical coronary artery bypass grafting may be necessary. The great saphenous \nvein, in the lower limb, is harvested and used as a graft.  \nIt is divided into several pieces, each of which is used to \nbypass blocked sections of the coronary arteries. The internal thoracic and radial arteries can also be used.\nFig. 3.80  A and B. Axial maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT image through the heart. A.

            "Text": "Thorax\n208\nIn the clinic\nCommon congenital heart defects\nThe most common abnormalities that occur during \ndevelopment are those produced by a defect in the atrial \nand ventricular septa.\nA defect in the interatrial septum  allows blood to pass \nfrom one side of the heart to the other from the chamber \nwith the higher pressure to the chamber with the lower \npressure; this is clinically referred to as a shunt . An atrial \nseptal defect (ASD)  allows oxygenated blood to flow from the \nleft atrium (higher pressure) across the ASD into the right \natrium (lower pressure), resulting in a left to right shunt and \nvolume overload in the right-sided circulation. Many patients \nwith ASD are asymptomatic, but in some cases the ASD may \ncause symptoms and needs to be closed surgically or by \nendovascular devices. Occasionally, increased blood flow into \nthe right atrium over many years leads to right atrial and right \nventricular hypertrophy and enlargement of the pulmonary \ntrunk, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension. In such \ncases, the patients can present with shortness of breath, \nincreasing tiredness, palpitations, fainting episodes and heart \nfailure. In ASD, the left ventricle is not enlarged as it is not \naffected by increased returning blood volume.\nThe most common of all congenital heart defects are \nthose that occur in the ventricular septum\u2014 ventriculoseptal \ndefect  (VSD). These lesions are most frequent in the \nmembranous portion of the septum and they allow blood to \nflow from the left ventricle (higher pressure) to the right \nventricle (lower pressure), leading to an abnormal \ncommunication between the systemic and pulmonary \ncirculation. This leads to right ventricular hypertrophy, \nincreased pulmonary blood flow, elevated arterial pulmonary \npressure, and increased blood volume returning to the left \nventricle, causing its dilation. Increased pulmonary pressure \nin most severe cases may cause pulmonary edema. If large \nenough and left untreated, VSDs can produce marked clinical \nproblems that might require surgery. VSD may be an isolated \nabnormality or part of a syndromic constellation, such as the \ntetralogy of Fallot.The tetralogy of Fallot,  the most common cyanotic \ncongenital heart disorder diagnosed soon after birth, \nclassically consists of four abnormalities: pulmonary \nstenosis, VSD, overriding aorta (originating to a varying \ndegree from the right ventricle), and right ventricular \nhypertrophy. The underdevelopment of the right ventricle \nand pulmonary stenosis reduce blood flow to the lungs, \nleading to reduced volume of oxygenated blood returning to \nthe heart. The defect in the interventricular septum causes \nmixing of oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood. The mixed \nblood is then delivered by the aorta to the major organs, \nresulting in poor oxygenation and cyanosis. Infants can \npresent with cyanosis at birth or develop episodes of \ncyanosis while feeding or crying (tet spells). Most affected \ninfants require surgical intervention. The advent of \ncardiopulmonary bypass was crucial in delivering highly \nsatisfactory surgical results.\nOccasionally, the ductus arteriosus , which connects the \nleft branch of the pulmonary artery to the inferior aspect of \nthe aortic arch, fails to close at birth. This is termed a patent  \nor persistent ductus arteriosus  (PDA). When this occurs, the \noxygenated blood in the aortic arch (higher pressure) passes \ninto the left branch of the pulmonary artery (lower pressure) \nand produces pulmonary hypertension and left atrial and \nventricular enlargement. The prognosis in patients with \nisolated PDA is extremely good, as most do not have any \nmajor sequelae after surgical closure.\nAll of these defects produce a left-to-right shunt, \nindicating that oxygenated blood from the left side of the \nheart is being mixed with deoxygenated blood from the \nright side of the heart before being recirculated into the \npulmonary circulation. These shunts are normally compatible \nwith life, but surgery or endovascular treatment may be \nnecessary.\nRarely, a shunt is right-to-left. In isolation, this is fatal; \nhowever, this type of shunt is often associated with other \nanomalies, so some deoxygenated blood is returned to the \nlungs and the systemic circulation.In the clinic\nClassic symptoms of heart attack\nThe typical symptoms are chest heaviness or pressure, \nwhich can be severe, lasting more than 20 minutes, and \noften associated with sweating. The pain in the chest \n(which may be described as an \u201celephant sitting on my \nchest\u201d or by using a clenched fist to describe the pain \n[Levine sign]) often radiates to the arms (left more \ncommon than the right), and can be associated with \nnausea. The severity of ischemia and infarction depends \non the rate at which the occlusion or stenosis has \noccurred and whether or not collateral channels have had \na chance to develop.In the clinic\nAre heart attack symptoms the same in men  \nand women?\nAlthough men and women can experience the typical \nsymptoms of severe chest pain, cold sweats, and pain in \nthe left arm, women are more likely than men to have \nsubtler, less recognizable symptoms. These may include \nabdominal pain, achiness in the jaw or back, nausea, \nshortness of breath, or simply fatigue. The mechanism  \nof this difference is not understood, but it is important  \nto consider cardiac ischemia for a wide range of \nsymptoms."

The great cardiac vein begins at  \nthe apex of  the heart (Fig. 3.82A). It ascends in the anterior \ninterventricular sulcus, where it is related to the anterior interventricular artery and is often termed the anterior interventricular vein. Reaching the coronary sulcus, the great cardiac vein turns to the left and continues onto the base/diaphragmatic surface of  the heart. At this point, it is associated with the circumflex branch of  the left coronary artery . Continuing along its path in the coronary sulcus, the great cardiac vein gradually enlarges to form the coro-nary sinus, which enters the right atrium (Fig. 3.82B).\nMiddle cardiac vein.  The middle cardiac vein (posterior \ninterventricular vein) begins near the apex of  the heart and ascends in the posterior interventricular sulcus toward the coronary sinus (Fig. 3.82B). It is associated with the posterior interventricular branch of  the right or left coro -\nnary artery throughout its course.\nSmall cardiac vein.  The small cardiac vein begins in the \nlower anterior section of  the coronary sulcus between the right atrium and right ventricle (Fig. 3.82A). It continues in this groove onto the base/diaphragmatic surface of  the heart where it enters the coronary sinus at its atrial end.  \nIt is a companion of  the right coronary artery throughout its course and may receive the right marginal vein (Fig. 3.82A). This small vein accompanies the marginal branch of  the right coronary artery along the acute margin of  the heart. If  the right marginal vein does not join the small cardiac vein, it enters the right atrium directly .\nPosterior cardiac vein.  The posterior cardiac vein lies on \nthe posterior surface of  the left ventricle just to the left of  the middle cardiac vein (Fig. 3.82B). It either enters the coronary sinus directly or joins the great cardiac vein.\nOther cardiac veins.  Two additional groups of  cardiac \nveins are also involved in the venous drainage of  the  \nheart.\n\u25a0 The anterior veins of  the right ventricle  (anterior \ncardiac veins) are small veins that arise on the anterior surface of  the right ventricle (Fig. 3.82A). They cross the coronary sulcus and enter the anterior wall of  the right atrium. They drain the anterior portion of  the right ventricle. The right marginal vein may be part  \nof  this group if  it does not enter the small cardiac  \nvein.\n\u25a0 A g roup of  smallest cardiac veins ( venae cordis \nminimae or veins of  Thebesius) have also been described.

It follows  \nalong the lower border of  the membranous part of  the interventricular septum before splitting into right and left bundles.\nThe right bundle branch continues on the right side \nof  the interventricular septum toward the apex of  the right ventricle. From the septum it enters the septomarginal trabecula to reach the base of  the anterior papillary muscle. At this point, it divides and is continuous with the final component of  the cardiac conduction system, the suben -\ndocardial plexus of  ventricular conduction cells or Purkinje fibers. This network of  specialized cells spreads throughout the ventricle to supply the ventricular musculature, includ -\ning the papillary muscles.\nThe left bundle branch  passes to the left side of  the \nmuscular interventricular septum and descends to the apex of  the left ventricle (Fig. 3.83B). Along its course  \nit gives off  branches that eventually become continuous with the subendocardial plexus of  conduction cells (Purkinje fibers). As with the right side, this network of  specialized cells spreads the excitation impulses through -\nout the left ventricle.\nCardiac innervation\nThe autonomic division of  the peripheral nervous system is directly responsible for regulating:\n\u25a0 hear t rate,\n\u25a0 force of  each contraction, and\n\u25a0 cardiac output.Cardiac conduction system\nThe musculature of  the atria and ventricles is capable of  contracting spontaneously . The cardiac conduction system initiates and coordinates contraction. The conduction system consists of  nodes and networks of  specialized cardiac muscle cells organized into four basic components:\n\u25a0 the sin u-atrial node,\n\u25a0 the a trioventricular node,\n\u25a0 the a trioventricular bundle with its right and left bundle \nbranches, and\n\u25a0 the subendocardial ple xus of  conduction cells (the \nPurkinje fibers).\nThe unique distribution pattern of  the cardiac conduc -\ntion system establishes an important unidirectional \npathway of  excitation/contraction. Throughout its course, large branches of  the conduction system are insulated from the surrounding myocardium by connective tissue. This tends to decrease inappropriate stimulation and con -\ntraction of  cardiac muscle fibers.\nThe number of  functional contacts between the con-\nduction pathway and cardiac musculature greatly increases in the subendocardial network.\nThus, a unidirectional wave of  excitation and contrac-\ntion is established, which moves from the papillary muscles and apex of  the ventricles to the arterial outflow tracts.\nIn the clinic\nCardiac conduction system\nThe cardiac conduction system can be affected by \ncoronary artery disease. The normal rhythm may be disturbed if the blood supply to the coronary conduction \nsystem is disrupted. If a dysrhythmia affects the heart rate \nor the order in which the chambers contract, heart failure and death may ensue.\nSinu-atrial node\nImpulses begin at the sinu-atrial node, the cardiac  \npacemaker. This collection of  cells is located at the supe-\nrior end of  the crista terminalis at the junction of  the superior vena cava and the right atrium (Fig. 3.83A).  \nThis is also the junction between the parts of  the right atrium derived from the embryonic sinus venosus and the atrium proper."

At approximately the level of  the intervertebral disc between vertebrae TV and TVI, opposite the left border of  the sternum and posterior to the third left costal cartilage, the pulmonary trunk divides into:\n\u25a0 the right pulmonar y artery , which passes to the right, \nposterior to the ascending aorta and the superior vena cava, to enter the right lung; and\n\u25a0 the left pulmonar y artery , which passes inferiorly to the \narch of  the aorta and anteriorly to the descending aorta to enter the left lung.\nAscending aorta\nThe ascending aorta is contained within the pericardial \nsac and is covered by a visceral layer of  serous pericardium, which also surrounds the pulmonary trunk in a common sheath (Fig. 3.85A).\nThe origin of  the ascending aorta is the aortic orifice at \nthe base of  the left ventricle, which is level with the lower edge of  the third left costal cartilage, posterior to the left half  of  the sternum. Moving superiorly , slightly forward and to the right, the ascending aorta continues to the level of  the second right costal cartilage. At this point, it enters the superior mediastinum and is then referred to as the arch of  the aorta .\nImmediately superior to the point where the ascending \naorta arises from the left ventricle are three small outward bulges opposite the semilunar cusps of  the aortic valve. These are the posterior, right, and left aortic sinuses. The right and left coronary arteries originate from the right and left aortic sinuses, respectively .\nOther vasculature\nThe inferior half  of  the superior vena cava is located within the pericardial sac (Fig. 3.85B). It passes through the fibrous pericardium at approximately the level of   \nthe second costal cartilage and enters the right atrium  \nat the lower level of  the third costal cartilage. The  \nportion within the pericardial sac is covered with serous pericardium except for a small area on its posterior surface.\nAfter passing through the diaphragm, at approximately \nthe level of  vertebra TVIII, the inferior vena cava enters the fibrous pericardium.

In the elderly adult, it is barely identifiable as an organ, consisting mostly of  fatty tissue that is some -\ntimes arranged as two lobulated fatty structures.\nArteries to the thymus consist of  small branches origi-\nnating from the internal thoracic arteries. Venous drainage is usually into the left brachiocephalic vein and possibly into the internal thoracic veins.\nLymphatic drainage returns to multiple groups of  nodes \nat one or more of  the following locations:\n\u25a0 along the inter nal thoracic arteries (parasternal);\n\u25a0 a t the tracheal bifurcation (tracheobronchial); and\n\u25a0 in the root of  the neck.\nIn the clinic\nEctopic parathyroid glands in the thymus\nThe parathyroid glands develop from the third pharyngeal \npouch, which also forms the thymus. The thymus is therefore a common site for ectopic parathyroid glands \nand, potentially, ectopic parathyroid hormone production.Right and left brachiocephalic veins\nThe left and right brachiocephalic veins are located imme-\ndiately posterior to the thymus. They form on each side at \nthe junction between the internal jugular and subclavian veins (see Fig. 3.86). The left brachiocephalic vein crosses the midline and joins with the right brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava (Fig. 3.88).\n\u25a0 The right brachiocephalic vein begins posterior to \nthe medial end of  the right clavicle and passes vertically downward, forming the superior vena cava when it is joined by the left brachiocephalic vein. Venous tributar -\nies include the vertebral, first posterior intercostal, and internal thoracic veins. The inferior thyroid and thymic veins may also drain into it.\n\u25a0 The left brachiocephalic vein begins posterior to the \nmedial end of  the left clavicle. It crosses to the right, moving in a slightly inferior direction, and joins with the right brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava posterior to the lower edge of  the right first costal cartilage close to the right sternal border. Venous tribu -\ntaries include the vertebral, first posterior intercostal, left superior intercostal, inferior thyroid, and internal thoracic veins. It may also receive thymic and pericar -\ndial veins. The left brachiocephalic vein crosses the \nmidline posterior to the manubrium in the adult. In infants and children the left brachiocephalic vein rises above the superior border of  the manubrium and there -\nfore is less protected."

Most of these lines (small-bore tubes) are \nintroduced through venous puncture into the axillary, \nsubclavian, or internal jugular veins. The lines are then passed through the main veins of the superior mediastinum, with the tips of the lines usually residing in the distal portion of the superior vena cava or in the right \natrium.\nSimilar devices, such as dialysis lines, are inserted into \npatients who have renal failure, so that a large volume of \nblood can be aspirated through one channel and reinfused \nthrough a second channel.In the clinic\nUsing the superior vena cava to access the inferior \nvena cava\nBecause the superior and inferior venae cavae are oriented \nalong the same vertical axis, a guidewire, catheter, or line can be passed from the superior vena cava through the \nright atrium and into the inferior vena cava. This is a \ncommon route of access for such procedures as:\n\u25a0 tr ansjugular liver biopsy,\n\u25a0 tr ansjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), \nand\n\u25a0 insertion o f an inferior vena cava filter to catch  \nemboli dislodged from veins in the lower limb  \nand pelvis (i.e., patients with deep vein  \nthrombosis [DVT]).\nArch of aorta and its branches\nThe thoracic portion of  the aorta can be divided into \nascending aorta, arch of  the aorta, and thoracic \n(descending) aorta.

Extending as high as the midlevel of  \nthe manubrium of  the sternum, the arch is initially ante -\nrior and finally lateral to the trachea.\nThree branches arise from the superior border of  the \narch of  the aorta; at their origins, all three are crossed anteriorly by the left brachiocephalic vein."

            "Text": "Thorax\n222\nIn the clinic\nCoarctation of the aorta\nCoarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormality in which \nthe aortic lumen is constricted just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. At this point, the aorta becomes \nsignificantly narrowed and the blood supply to the lower \nlimbs and abdomen is diminished. Over time, collateral vessels develop around the chest wall and abdomen to supply the lower body. Dilated and tortuous intercostal vessels, which form a bypass to supply the descending thoracic aorta, may lead to erosions of the inferior margins of the ribs. This can be appreciated on chest radiographs as inferior rib notching and is usually seen in long standing \ncases. The coarctation also affects the heart, which has to \npump the blood at higher pressure to maintain peripheral perfusion. This in turn may produce cardiac failure.\nIn the clinic\nAortic arch and its anomalies\nThe normal aortic arch courses to the left of the trachea and passes over the left main bronchus. A right-sided aortic arch occurs when the vessel courses to the right of \nthe trachea and passes over the right main bronchus. A \nright-sided arch of aorta is rare and may be asymptomatic. It can be associated with dextrocardia (right-sided heart) \nand, in some instances, with complete situs inversus \n(left-to-right inversion of the body\u2019s organs). It can also be \nassociated with abnormal branching of the great vessels, \nparticularly with an aberrant left subclavian artery.In the clinic\nAbnormal origin of great vessels\nGreat vessels occasionally have an abnormal origin, including:\n\u25a0 a c ommon origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the \nleft common carotid artery,\n\u25a0 the le ft vertebral artery originating from the aortic arch, \nand\n\u25a0 the righ t subclavian artery originating from the distal \nportion of the aortic arch and passing behind the esophagus to supply the right arm\u2014as a result, the great vessels form a vascular ring around the trachea \nand the esophagus, which can potentially produce \ndifficulty swallowing. This configuration is one of the most common aortic arch abnormalities.In the clinic\nThoracic aorta\nDiffuse atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta may occur in patients with vascular disease, but this rarely produces symptoms. There are, however, two clinical situations in \nwhich aortic pathology can produce life-threatening \nsituations.\nTrauma\nThe aorta has three fixed points of attachment:\n\u25a0 the aortic valv e,\n\u25a0 the ligamen tum arteriosum, and\n\u25a0 the poin t of passing behind the median arcuate ligament \nof the diaphragm to enter the abdomen.\nThe rest of the aorta is relatively free from attachment to \nother structures of the mediastinum. A serious deceleration \ninjury (e.g., in a road traffic accident) is most likely to cause aortic trauma at these fixed points.\nAortic dissection\nIn certain conditions, such as in severe arteriovascular disease, the wall of the aorta can split longitudinally, creating a false channel, which may or may not rejoin into the true \nlumen distally (Fig. 3.91). This aortic dissection occurs \nbetween the intima and media anywhere along its length. If it occurs in the ascending aorta or arch of the aorta, blood flow in the coronary and cerebral arteries may be disrupted, resulting in myocardial infarction or stroke. In the abdomen \nthe visceral vessels may be disrupted, producing ischemia to \nthe gut or kidneys.\nFig. 3.91  Axial CT showing aortic dissection. \nLeft lung\nAortic arch\u2014false lumen Aortic arch\u2014true lumenTrachea Dissection flap\nRight lung"

The right side is covered by the mediastinal part of  the parietal pleura.\nPosterior to the esophagus, the thoracic duct is on the \nright side inferiorly , but crosses to the left more superiorly . Also on the left side of  the esophagus is the thoracic aorta.\nAnterior to the esophagus, below the level of  the tra-\ncheal bifurcation, are the right pulmonary artery and the left main bronchus. The esophagus then passes immedi -\nately posteriorly to the left atrium, separated from it only by pericardium. Inferior to the left atrium, the esophagus is related to the diaphragm.\nStructures other than the thoracic duct posterior to the \nesophagus include portions of  the hemiazygos veins, the right posterior intercostal vessels, and, near the diaphragm, the thoracic aorta.\nThe esophagus is a flexible, muscular tube that can be \ncompressed or narrowed by surrounding structures at four locations (Fig. 3.98):\n\u25a0 the junction of  the esophagus with the pharynx in  \nthe neck;\n\u25a0 in the superior mediastinum where the esophagus is \ncrossed by the arch of  the aorta;\n\u25a0 in the posterior mediastin um where the esophagus is \ncompressed by the left main bronchus;\n\u25a0 in the posterior mediastin um at the esophageal hiatus \nin the diaphragm.\nThese constrictions have important clinical conse-\nquences. For example, a swallowed object is most likely to \nlodge at a constricted area. An ingested corrosive substance would move more slowly through a narrowed region, causing more damage at this site than elsewhere along the esophagus. Also, constrictions present problems during the passage of  medical instruments.\nArterial supply and venous  \nand lymphatic drainage\nThe arterial supply and venous drainage of  the esopha-gus in the posterior mediastinum involve many vessels. Esophageal arteries arise from the thoracic aorta, bronchial arteries, and ascending branches of  the left gastric artery in the abdomen.Thoracic duct in the superior mediastinum\nThe thoracic duct, which is the major lymphatic vessel in \nthe body , passes through the posterior portion of  the supe -\nrior mediastinum (see Figs. 3.87 and 3.92). It:\n\u25a0 enter s the superior mediastinum inferiorly , slightly to \nthe left of  the midline, having moved to this position just before leaving the posterior mediastinum opposite ver -\ntebral level TIV/V; and\n\u25a0 contin ues through the superior mediastinum, posterior \nto the arch of  the aorta, and the initial portion of  the left subclavian artery , between the esophagus and the left mediastinal part of  the parietal pleura.\nPosterior mediastinum\nThe posterior mediastinum is posterior to the pericardial \nsac and diaphragm and anterior to the bodies of  the mid and lower thoracic vertebrae (see Fig. 3.57).\n\u25a0 Its superior boundar y is a transverse plane passing from \nthe sternal angle to the intervertebral disc between vertebrae TIV and TV .\n\u25a0 Its inf erior boundary is the diaphragm.\n\u25a0 La terally , it is bordered by the mediastinal part of  pari -\netal pleura on either side.\n\u25a0 Superiorl y , it is continuous with the superior \nmediastinum.\nMajor structures in the posterior mediastinum  \ninclude the:\n\u25a0 esopha gus and its associated nerve plexus,\n\u25a0 thor acic aorta and its branches,\n\u25a0 azy gos system of  veins,\n\u25a0 thor acic duct and associated lymph nodes,\n\u25a0 sympa thetic trunks, and\n\u25a0 thor acic splanchnic nerves.\nEsophagus\nThe esophagus is a muscular tube passing between the \npharynx in the neck and the stomach in the abdomen. It \nbegins at the inferior border of  the cricoid cartilage, oppo-site vertebra CVI, and ends at the cardiac opening of  the stomach, opposite vertebra TXI.\nThe esophagus descends on the anterior aspect of  the \nbodies of  the vertebrae, generally in a midline position as it moves through the thorax (Fig. 3.97). As it approaches the diaphragm, it moves anteriorly and to the left, crossing from the right side of  the thoracic aorta to eventually assume a position anterior to it. It then passes through the esophageal hiatus, an opening in the muscular part of  the diaphragm, at vertebral level TX."

At this level, somatic afferent nerves from \nspinal nerves T1 to T4 also enter the spinal cord via the posterior roots. Both types of afferents (visceral and somatic) synapse with interneurons, which then synapse with second \nneurons whose fibers pass across the cord and then ascend \nto the somatosensory areas of the brain that represent the T1 to T4 levels. The brain is unable to distinguish clearly between the visceral sensory distribution and the somatic sensory distribution and therefore the pain is interpreted as \narising from the somatic regions rather than the visceral \norgan (i.e., the heart; Fig. 3.114C).\nThe patient was breathless because his left ventricular \nfunction was poor.\nWhen the left ventricle fails, it produces two effects.\n\u25a0 First , the contractile force is reduced.

A chest radiograph obtained on \nadmission to the emergency room demonstrated complete \ncollapse of the lung.\nA further chest radiograph performed 20 minutes later \ndemonstrated an air/fluid level in the pleural cavity  \n(eFig. 3.117).Three common pathological processes may occur in the pleural cavity.\n\u25a0 If air is intr oduced into the pleural cavity, a \npneumothorax develops and the lung collapses because of its own elastic recoil. The pleural space fills with air, which may further compress the lung. Most patients with \na collapsed lung are unlikely to have respiratory \nimpairment. Under certain conditions, air may enter the pleural cavity at such a rate that it shifts and pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side of the chest. This is called tension pneumothorax and is potentially lethal, \nrequiring urgent treatment by insertion of an intercostal tube to remove the air. The commonest causes of pneumothorax are rib fractures and positive pressure ventilation lung damage.\n\u25a0 The pleur al cavity may fill with fluid (a pleural effusion) \nand this can be associated with many diseases  \n(e.g., lung infection, cancer, abdominal sepsis). It is important to aspirate fluid from these patients to relieve \nany respiratory impairment and to carry out laboratory \ntests on the fluid to determine its nature.\n\u25a0 Se vere chest trauma can lead to development of \nhemopneumothorax. A tube must be inserted to remove the blood and air that has entered the pleural space and prevent respiratory impairment.\nThis man needs treatment to drain either the air or fluid or both.\nThe pleural space can be accessed by passing a needle \nbetween the ribs into the pleural cavity. In a normal healthy \nadult, the pleural space is virtually nonexistent; therefore, \nany attempt to introduce a needle into this space is unlikely \neFig. 3.117  Chest radiograph demonstra ting an air/fluid level in \nthe pleural cavity. \nCase 4\nLUNG CANCER\nA 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple \ndilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph \ndemonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.\nBy observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical \nknowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred.The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a \ncommon vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the \nsuperior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor."

She had a left-sided pacemaker box, which had been inserted for a cardiac rhythm disorder \n(fast atrial fibrillation) many years previously. An ECG \ndemonstrated fast atrial fibrillation. A chest radiograph showed that the wire from the pacemaker had broken under the clavicle.\nAnatomical knowledge of this region of the chest explains \nwhy the wire broke.\nMany patients have cardiac pacemakers. A wire arises from \nthe pacemaker, which lies within the subcutaneous tissue \nover the pectoralis major muscle and travels from the \npacemaker under the skin to pierce the axillary vein just beneath the clavicle, lateral to the subclavius muscle. The wire then passes through the subclavian vein, the brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, and the right \natrium, and lies on the wall of the right ventricle (where it \ncan stimulate the heart to contract) (eFig. 3.118). If the wire pierces the axillary vein directly adjacent to the subclavius muscle, it is possible that after many years of shoulder movement the subclavius muscle stresses and breaks the \nwire, causing the pacemaker to fail. Every effort is made to \nplace the insertion point of the wire as far laterally as feasible within the first part of the axillary vein.\neFig. 3.118  Chest radiograph of an individ ual with a pacemaker. \nThe pacemaker wires (2) can be seen traveling through the \nvenous system to the heart where one ends in the right atrium \nand the other ends in the right ventricle. \nCase 5\u2014cont\u2019d\nto succeed and the procedure may damage the underlying \nlung.\nBefore any form of chest tube is inserted, the rib must be \nwell anesthetized by infiltration because its periosteum  \nis extremely sensitive. The intercostal drain should pass directly on top of the rib. Insertion adjacent to the lower part of the rib may damage the artery, vein, and nerve, which lie \nwithin the neurovascular bundle.\nAppropriate sites for insertion of a chest drain are either in \nthe fourth or fifth intercostal space between the anterior axillary and midaxillary anatomical lines.This position is determined by palpating the sternal angle, which is the point of articulation of rib II. Counting inferiorly will determine the rib number and simple observation will \ndetermine the positions of the anterior axillary and \nmidaxillary lines. Insertion of any tube or needle below the fifth interspace runs an appreciable risk of crossing the pleural recesses and placing the needle or the drain into either the liver or the spleen, depending upon which side \nthe needle is inserted."

A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI ( eFig. \n3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries.\nCoarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to \nthe left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly \nreduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior \nepigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. \nThese arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which \nanastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs.\nThe first and second posterior intercostal vessels are \nsupplied from the costocervical trunk, which arises from the subclavian artery proximal to the coarctation, so do not enlarge and do not induce rib notching.\neFig. 3.119  Chest radiograph demonstra ting translucent notches \nalong the inferior border of ribs III to VI. \nAORTIC DISSECTION\nA 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it \nwas noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye \nsurgery for dislocating lenses.\nOn examination the man was pale, clammy, and \nhypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG \ndemonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum \nblood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis.\nThe patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a \ndiagnosis of aortic dissection was made.\nAortic dissection is an uncommon disorder in which a small \ntear occurs within the aortic wall (eFig. 3.120). The aortic wall contains three layers, an intima, a media, and an adventitia. A tear in the intima extends into the media and peels it \naway, forming a channel within the wall of the vessel. Usually the blood reenters the main vessel wall distal to its \npoint of entry.\nThe myocardial infarction\nAortic dissection may extend retrogradely to involve the coronary sinus of the right coronary artery. Unfortunately, in this patient\u2019s case the right coronary artery became occluded \nas the dissection passed into the origin. In normal \nindividuals the right coronary artery supplies the anterior inferior aspect of the myocardium, and this is evident as an anterior myocardial infarct on an ECG.\nThe ischemic left leg\nThe two channels within the aorta have extended throughout the length of the aorta into the right iliac system and to the level of the right femoral artery.

He also complained of a cough with \nstreaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, \nespecially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets.\nOn examination the patient had a low-grade temperature \nand was tachypneic (breathing fast). There was reduced expansion of the left side of the chest. When the chest was \npercussed it was noted that the anterior aspect of the left \nchest was dull, compared to the resonant percussion note of the remainder of the chest. Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) revealed decreased breath sounds, which \nwere hoarse in nature (bronchial breathing).\nA diagnosis of chest infection was made.\nChest infection is a common disease. In most patients the \ninfection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, \nfilling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The \ndiffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia.\nGiven the patient\u2019s specific clinical findings, bronchial \npneumonia was unlikely.\nFrom the clinical findings it was clear that the patient was \nlikely to have a pneumonia confined to a lobe. Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a \nleft upper lobe pneumonia.\nA chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The \nposteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung.\nKnowing the position of the oblique fissure, any \nconsolidation within the left upper lobe will produce this veil-like shadowing. Lateral radiographs are usually not necessary but would demonstrate opacification anteriorly and superiorly that ends abruptly at the oblique fissure.\nUpper lobe pneumonias are unusual because most patients \ndevelop gravity-dependent infection. Certain infections, \nhowever, are typical within the middle and upper lobes, commonly, tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis.\nA review of the patient\u2019s history suggested a serious and \nchronic illness and the patient was admitted to hospital.\nAfter admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum \nwas aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified.\neFig. 3.121  Chest radiograph showing lef t upper lobe infection."

The physician \nexamined the patient and noted since his last visit he had \nlost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests \nrevealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the \ngastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer \nwas made and the patient underwent a resection, which \ninvolved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the \npatient remains well though still subject to follow-up.\nThe patient underwent a flexible endoscopic examination of \nthe esophagus in which a tube is placed through the mouth \nand into the esophagus and a camera is placed on the end \nof the tube. It is also possible to use biopsy forceps to obtain \nsmall portions of tissue for adequate diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma was made \n(squamous cell type) and the patient underwent a staging \nprocedure.\nStaging of any malignancy is important because it \ndetermines the extent of treatment and allows the physician \nto determine the patient\u2019s prognosis. In this case our patient \nunderwent a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, which \nrevealed no significant lymph nodes around the lower third \nesophageal tumor.\nThe abdominal scan revealed no evidence of spread to the \nnodes around the celiac trunk and no evidence of spread to \nthe liver.\nBleeding was the cause of the anemia.\nMany tumors of the gastrointestinal system are remarkably \nfriable, and with the passage of digested material across the \ntumor, low-grade chronic bleeding occurs. Over a period of \ntime the patient is rendered anemic, which in the first \ninstance is asymptomatic; however, it can be diagnosed on \nroutine blood tests.Complex surgery is planned.\nThe length of the esophagus is approximately 22 cm. Tumor \nspread can occur through the submucosal route and also \nthrough locoregional lymph nodes. The lymph nodes drain \nalong the arterial supply to the esophagus, which is \npredominantly supplied by the inferior thyroid artery, \nesophageal branches from the thoracic aorta, and branches \nfrom the left gastric artery. The transthoracic esophagectomy \nprocedure involves placing the patient supine. A laparotomy \nis performed to assess for any evidence of disease in the \nabdominal cavity. The stomach is mobilized, with \npreservation of the right gastric and right gastro-omental \narteries. The short gastric vessels and left gastric vessels are \ndivided, and a pyloromyotomy is also performed.\nThe abdominal wound is then closed and the patient is \nplaced in the left lateral position. A right posterolateral \nthoracotomy is performed through the fifth intercostal space, \nand the azygos vein is divided to provide full access to the \nwhole length of the esophagus. The stomach is delivered \nthrough the diaphragmatic hiatus. The esophagus is resected \nand the stomach is anastomosed to the cervical esophagus.\nThe patient made an uneventful recovery.\nMost esophageal cancers are diagnosed relatively late and \noften have lymph node metastatic spread. A number of \npatients will also have a spread of tumor to the liver. The \noverall prognosis for esophageal cancer is poor, with \napproximately a 25%, 5-year survival rate.\nDiagnosing esophageal cancer in its early stages before \nlymph node spread is ideal and can produce a curative \nprocedure.\nOur patient went on to have chemotherapy and enjoys a \ngood quality of life 4 years after his operation."

Unfortunately the \ndisease had spread to the axillary lymph nodes and bones \n(bony metastatic disease). A surgeon duly resected the \nprimary breast tumor with a wide local excision and then \nperformed an axillary nodal clearance. The patient was \nthen referred to an oncologist for chemotherapy. \nChemotherapy was delivered through a portacath, which is \na subcutaneous reservoir from which a small catheter \npasses under the skin into the internal jugular vein. The \npatient duly underwent a portacath insertion without \ncomplication, completed her course of chemotherapy, and is \ncurrently doing well 5 years later.\nThe portacath was placed on the patient\u2019s right anterior \nchest wall and the line was placed into the right internal \njugular vein. The left internal jugular vein and subcutaneous \ntissues were not used. The reason for not using this site was \nthat the patient had previously undergone an axillary \ndissection on the left, and the lymph nodes and lymphatics \nwere removed. Placement of a portacath in this region may \nproduce an inflammatory response and may even get \ninfected. Unfortunately, because there are no lymphatics to \ndrain away infected material and to remove bacteria, severe \nsepsis and life-threatening infection may ensue.\nHow was it placed?\nThe ultrasound shows an axial image across the root of the \nneck on the right demonstrating the right common carotid artery and the right internal jugular vein. The internal jugular \nvein is the larger of the two structures and generally \ndemonstrates normal respiratory variation, compressibility, \nand a size dependence upon the patient\u2019s position (when \nthe patient is placed in the head-down position, the vein fills \nand makes puncture easy).\nThe risks of the procedure\nAs with all procedures and operations there is always a small \nrisk of complication. These risks are always balanced against \nthe potential benefits of the procedure. Placing the needle \ninto the internal jugular vein can be performed under \nultrasound guidance, which reduces the risk of puncturing \nthe common carotid artery. Furthermore, by puncturing \nunder direct vision it is less likely that the operator will hit \nthe lung apex and pierce the superior pleural fascia, which \nmay produce a pneumothorax.\nThe position of the indwelling catheter\nThe catheter is placed through the right internal jugular vein \nand into the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip of the \ncatheter is then placed more inferiorly at the junction of the \nright atrium and the superior vena cava. The reason for \nplacing the catheter in such a position relates to the agents \nthat are infused. Most chemotherapeutic agents are severely \ncytotoxic (kill cells), and enabling good mixing with the \nblood prevents thrombosis and vein wall irritation.\nCase 12  \nCYSTIC FIBROSIS WITH BRONCHIECTASIS\nA 15-year-old girl presented to the emergency department \nwith a 1-week history of productive cough with copious \npurulent sputum, increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, \nfever around 38.5\u00b0 C, and no response to oral amoxicillin \nprescribed to her by a family physician. The patient was \ndiagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after birth and had \nmultiple admissions to the hospital for pulmonary and \ngastrointestinal manifestations of the disease.\nPhysical examination on the current admission to the ER \nrevealed widespread inspiratory crackles, mild tachycardia of \n105/min, and fever of 38.2\u00b0 C. Diagnosis of infective \nexacerbation of bronchiectasis was made. Sputum was sent \nfor microbiology, which later came back positive for \nPseudomonas aeruginosa , a common pathogen isolated in \nsuch patients.\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting \nthe function of exocrine glands due to a gene mutation, \nleading to an abnormally low concentration of chloride in exocrine secretions, rendering them thick and sticky. Thick \nsecretions cause blockage and subsequent damage to the \nairways, bowel, pancreas, liver, and reproductive tract. In the \nlungs, thick nonclearing secretions lead to recurrent \ninfections and persistent inflammation, resulting in \npermanent distortion and dilation of the distal bronchi, a \ncondition known as bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis can be \nseen on plain chest radiographs as tubular (tram track like) \nstructures, particularly affecting the upper lobes. Computed \ntomography can easily demonstrate the extent of airway \ndamage and identify potential pulmonary complications of \ncystic fibrosis such as lobar collapse, pneumothorax, or \nenlargement of the pulmonary trunk due to pulmonary \nhypertension.\nThe patient was admitted for a course of broad-spectrum \nintravenous antibiotics and intensive chest physiotherapy \nand made satisfactory recovery from the acute episode. She \nwas discharged home on oral prophylactic antibiotics with \nan ongoing physiotherapy program."

The margin of  the inferior thoracic aperture consists of  vertebra TXII, rib XII, the distal end of  rib XI, the costal margin, and the xiphoid process of  the sternum.\nDiaphragm\nThe musculotendinous diaphragm separates the abdomen from the thorax.\nThe diaphragm attaches to the margin of  the inferior \nthoracic aperture, but the attachment is complex posteri -\norly and extends into the lumbar area of  the vertebral column (Fig. 4.8). On each side, a muscular extension (crus) firmly anchors the diaphragm to the anterolateral surface of  the vertebral column as far down as vertebra LIII on the right and vertebra LII on the left.\nBecause the costal margin is not complete posteriorly , \nthe diaphragm is anchored to arch-shaped (arcuate) liga -\nments, which span the distance between available bony points and the intervening soft tissues:"

The spleen develops in the dorsal mesentery in the region between the body wall and presumptive stomach.\nIn the foregut, the developing stomach rotates clockwise \nand the associated dorsal mesentery , containing the spleen, moves to the left and greatly expands. During this process, part of  the mesentery becomes associated with, and sec -\nondarily fuses with, the left side of  the body wall.\nAt the same time, the duodenum, together with its \ndorsal mesentery and an appreciable part of  the pancreas, swings to the right and fuses to the body wall.\nSecondary fusion of  the duodenum to the body wall, \nmassive growth of  the liver in the ventral mesentery , and fusion of  the superior surface of  the liver to the diaphragm restrict the opening to the space enclosed by the ballooned dorsal mesentery associated with the stomach. This restricted opening is the omental foramen (epiploic \nforamen).\nThe part of  the abdominal cavity enclosed by the \nexpanded dorsal mesentery , and posterior to the stomach, is the omental bursa (lesser sac). Access, through the omental foramen, to this space from the rest of  the perito -\nneal cavity (greater sac) is inferior to the free edge of  the ventral mesentery .\nPart of  the dorsal mesentery that initially forms part of  \nthe lesser sac greatly enlarges in an inferior direction, and the two opposing surfaces of  the mesentery fuse to form an apron-like structure (the greater omentum). The greater \nomentum is suspended from the greater curvature of  the stomach, lies over other viscera in the abdominal cavity , and is the first structure observed when the abdominal cavity is opened anteriorly .\nDevelopment of the midgut\nThe midgut develops into the distal part of  the duodenum and the jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, and proximal \ntwo-thirds of  the transverse colon. A small yolk sac pro -\njects anteriorly from the developing midgut into the  \numbilicus.\nRapid growth of  the gastrointestinal system results in a \nloop of  the midgut herniating out of  the abdominal cavity and into the umbilical cord. As the body grows in size and the connection with the yolk sac is lost, the midgut returns to the abdominal cavity . While this process is occurring, the two limbs of  the midgut loop rotate counterclockwise KEY FEATURES\nArrangement of abdominal viscera  \nin the adult\nA basic knowledge of  the development of  the gastro-\nintestinal tract is needed to understand the arrangement of  viscera and mesenteries in the abdomen (Fig. 4.13).\nThe early gastrointestinal tract is oriented longitudinally \nin the body cavity and is suspended from surrounding walls by a large dorsal mesentery and a much smaller ventral mesentery .\nSuperiorly , the dorsal and ventral mesenteries are \nanchored to the diaphragm.\nThe primitive gut tube consists of  the foregut, the \nmidgut, and the hindgut. Massive longitudinal growth of  the gut tube, rotation of  selected parts of  the tube, and secondary fusion of  some viscera and their associated mesenteries to the body wall participate in generating the adult arrangement of  abdominal organs.\nDevelopment of the foregut\nIn abdominal regions, the foregut gives rise to the distal \nend of  the esophagus, the stomach, and the proximal part of  the duodenum.

Traditionally, incisions have been placed at and around the \nregion of surgical interest. The size of these incisions  \nwas usually large to allow good access and optimal \nvisualization of the abdominal cavity. As anesthesia has developed and muscle-relaxing drugs have become widely used, the abdominal incisions have become smaller.\nCurrently, the most commonly used large abdominal \nincision is a central craniocaudad incision from the  \nxiphoid process to the symphysis pubis, which provides wide access to the whole of the abdominal contents  \nand allows an exploratory procedure to be performed (laparotomy).Nine-region pattern\nThe nine-region pattern is based on two horizontal and two \nvertical planes (Fig. 4.23).\n\u25a0 The superior horizontal plane (the subcostal plane) is \nimmediately inferior to the costal margins, which places it at the lower border of  the costal cartilage of  rib X and passing posteriorly through the body of  vertebra LIII. (Note, however, that sometimes the transpyloric \nplane, halfway between the jugular notch and the symphysis pubis or halfway between the umbilicus and the inferior end of  the body of  the sternum, passing posteriorly through the lower border of  vertebra LI and intersecting with the costal margin at the ends of  the ninth costal cartilages, is used instead.)\n\u25a0 The inf erior horizontal plane (the intertubercular \nplane) connects the tubercles of  the iliac crests, which are palpable structures 5  cm posterior to the anterior \nsuperior iliac spines, and passes through the upper part of  the body of  vertebra LV .\n\u25a0 The v ertical planes pass from the midpoint of  the clavi -\ncles inferiorly to a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis.\nThese four planes establish the topographical divisions \nin the nine-region organization. The following designa -\ntions are used for each region: superiorly the right  \nhypochondrium, the epigastric region, and the left hypo -\nchondrium; inferiorly the right groin (inguinal region), \npubic region, and left groin (inguinal region); and in the middle the right flank (lateral region), the umbilical region, and the left flank (lateral region) (Fig. 4.23)."

As the \nincisions are much smaller than those used in traditional \nabdominal surgery, patients experience less postoperative \npain and have shorter recovery times. There is also a \nfavorable cosmetic outcome with smaller scars. Several \nsurgical procedures such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, \nand hernia repair, as well as numerous orthopaedic, \nurological, and gynecological procedures, are now \ncommonly performed laparoscopically.\nDuring the operation, a camera known as a  \nlaparoscope is used to transmit live, magnified images of the \nsurgical field to a monitor viewed by the surgeon. The \ncamera is inserted into the abdominal cavity through a small \nincision, called a port-site, usually at the umbilicus. In order \nto create enough space to operate, the abdominal wall is \nelevated by inflating the cavity with gas, typically carbon \ndioxide. Other long, thin surgical instruments are then \nintroduced through additional port-sites, which can be  \nused by the surgeon to operate. The placement of these port-sites is carefully planned to allow optimal access to the \nsurgical field.\nLaparoscopic surgery has been further enhanced with the \nuse of surgical robots. Using these systems the surgeon \nmoves the surgical instruments indirectly by controlling \nrobotic arms, which are inserted into the operating field \nthrough small incisions. Robot-assisted surgery is now \nroutinely used worldwide and has helped overcome some of \nthe limitations of laparoscopy by enhancing the surgeon\u2019s \ndexterity. The robotic system is precise, provides the \nsurgeon with a 3D view of the surgical field, and allows \nimproved degree of rotation and manipulation of the surgical \ninstruments. Several procedures such as prostatectomy and \ncholecystectomy can now be performed with this method.\nLaparoendoscopic single-site surgery, also known as \nsingle-port laparoscopy, is the most recent advance in \nlaparoscopic surgery. This method uses a single incision, \nusually umbilical, to introduce a port with several operating \nchannels and can be performed with or without robotic \nassistance. Benefits include less postoperative pain, a faster \nrecovery time, and an even better cosmetic result than \ntraditional laparoscopic surgery."

This process depends on the development  \nof  the gubernaculum, which extends from the inferior border of  the developing gonad to the labioscrotal swellings (Fig. 4.41).\nThe processus vaginalis is immediately anterior to the \ngubernaculum within the inguinal canal.\nIn men, as the testes descend, the testes and their \naccompanying vessels, ducts, and nerves pass through the inguinal canal and are therefore surrounded by the same fascial layers of  the abdominal wall.

Laparoscopic view showing the parietal peritoneum still covering the area. Fig. 4.50, cont\u2019d\nIn the clinic\nMasses around the groin\nAround the groin there is a complex confluence of \nanatomical structures. Careful examination and good anatomical knowledge allow determination of the correct \nanatomical structure from which the mass arises and \ntherefore the diagnosis. The most common masses in the groin are hernias.\nThe key to groin examination is determining the position \nof the inguinal ligament. The inguinal ligament passes \nbetween the anterior superior iliac spine laterally and the \npubic tubercle medially. Inguinal hernias are above the inguinal ligament and are usually more apparent on standing. A visual assessment of the lump is necessary, \nbearing in mind the anatomical landmarks of the inguinal \nligament.\nIn men, it is wise to examine the scrotum to check for a \nlump. If an abnormal mass is present, an inability to feel its upper edge suggests that it may originate from the inguinal \ncanal and might be a hernia. By placing the hand over the \nlump and asking the patient to cough, the lump bulges outward.\nAn attempt should be made to reduce the swelling by \napplying gentle, firm pressure over the lump. If the lump is \nreducible, the hand should be withdrawn and careful \nobservation will reveal recurrence of the mass.\nThe position of an abnormal mass in the groin relative to \nthe pubic tubercle is very important, as are the presence of increased temperature and pain, which may represent early \nsigns of strangulation or infection.\nAs a general rule:\n\u25a0 An inguinal hernia appears thr ough the superficial \ninguinal ring above the pubic tubercle and crest.\u25a0 A f emoral hernia (see below) appears through the \nfemoral canal below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.\nA hernia is the protrusion of a viscus, in part or in whole, \nthrough a normal or abnormal opening. The viscus usually \ncarries a covering of parietal peritoneum, which forms the lining of the hernial sac.\nInguinal hernias\nHernias occur in a variety of regions. The commonest site is the groin of the lower anterior abdominal wall. In some patients, inguinal hernias are present from birth (congenital) \nand are caused by the persistence of the processus vaginalis \nand the passage of viscera through the inguinal canal. Acquired hernias occur in older patients and causes include raised intraabdominal pressure (e.g., from repeated coughing associated with lung disease), damage to nerves of the \nanterior abdominal wall (e.g., from surgical abdominal \nincisions), and weakening of the walls of the inguinal canal.\nOne of the potential problems with hernias is that bowel \nand fat may become stuck within the hernial sac. This can \ncause appreciable pain and bowel obstruction, necessitating \nurgent surgery. Another potential risk is strangulation of the \nhernia, in which the blood supply to the bowel is cut off at the neck of the hernial sac, rendering the bowel ischemic and susceptible to perforation (Fig. 4.51 ).\nThe hernial sac of an indirect inguinal hernia  enters the \ndeep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal. If the hernia is large enough, the hernial sac may emerge through the superficial inguinal ring. In men, such a hernia may extend into the scrotum (Fig. 4.52).\nThe hernial sac of a direct inguinal hernia  pushes forward \nthrough the posterior wall of the inguinal canal immediately"

The parietal peritoneum lines the walls of  the cavity and  \nthe visceral peritoneum covers the viscera. Between the parietal and visceral layers of  peritoneum is a potential space (the peritoneal cavity). Abdominal viscera either are suspended in the peritoneal cavity by folds of  peritoneum (mesenteries) or are outside the peritoneal cavity . Organs suspended in the cavity are referred to as intraperitoneal (Fig. 4.53); organs outside the peritoneal cavity , with only one surface or part of  one surface covered by peritoneum, are retroperitoneal.\nInnervation of the peritoneum\nThe parietal peritoneum associated with the abdominal wall is innervated by somatic afferents carried in branches of  the associated spinal nerves and is therefore sensitive to well-localized pain. The visceral peritoneum is innervated by visceral afferents that accompany autonomic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic) back to the central nervous system. Activation of  these fibers can lead to referred and poorly localized sensations of  discomfort, and to reflex visceral motor activity .\nFig. 4.53  A. Intraperitoneal. B.

Occasionally, they are congenital \nand result from failure of the small bowel to return to the abdominal cavity from the umbilical cord during \ndevelopment. After birth, umbilical hernias may result from \nincomplete closure of the umbilicus (navel). Overall, most of these hernias close in the first year of life, and surgical repair is not generally attempted until later.\nPara-umbilical hernias may occur in adults at and around \nthe umbilicus and often have small necks, so requiring surgical treatment.\nIncisional hernias\nIncisional hernias occur through a defect in a scar of a previous abdominal operation. Usually, the necks of these hernias are wide and do not therefore strangulate the viscera they contain.\nOther hernias\nA spigelian hernia passes upward through the arcuate line \ninto the lateral border at the lower part of the posterior rectus sheath. It may appear as a tender mass on one side \nof the lower anterior abdominal wall.\nAbdominopelvic cavity hernias can also develop in \nassociation with the pelvic walls, and sites include the \nobturator canal, the greater sciatic foramen and above and below the piriformis muscle."

It is not detectable on any available \nimaging such as ultrasound or computed tomography. In \nvarious pathological conditions (e.g., in liver cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis, or heart failure) the volume of peritoneal fluid can increase; this is known as ascites. In cases of high volume of free intraperitoneal fluid, marked abdominal \ndistention can be observed (Fig. 4.56 ).\nThe peritoneal space has a large surface area, which \nfacilitates the spread of disease through the peritoneal cavity \nand over the bowel and visceral surfaces. Conversely, this \nlarge surface area can be used for administering certain \ntypes of treatment and a number of procedures.\nVentriculoperitoneal shunts\nPatients with obstructive hydrocephalus (an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the cerebral ventricular system) require continuous drainage of this fluid. \nThis is achieved by placing a fine-bore catheter through the \nskull into the cerebral ventricles and placing the extracranial part of the tube beneath the scalp and skin of the neck and chest wall, and then through the abdominal wall into the peritoneal cavity. Cerebrospinal fluid drains through the tube \ninto the peritoneal cavity, where it is absorbed.\nDialysis and peritoneal dialysis\nPeople who develop renal failure require dialysis to live. \nThere are two methods.\nIn the first method ( hemodialysis), blood is taken from \nthe circulation, dialyzed through a complex artificial membrane, and returned to the body. A high rate of blood flow is required to remove excess body fluid, exchange electrolytes, and remove noxious metabolites. T o accomplish this, either an arteriovenous fistula is established surgically \n(by connecting an artery to a vein, usually in the upper limb, \nand requiring approximately six weeks to \u201cmature\u201d) and is cannulated each time the patient returns for dialysis, or a large-bore cannula is placed into the right atrium, through \nwhich blood can be aspirated and returned.\nIn the second method (peritoneal dialysis), the \nperitoneum is used as the dialysis membrane. The large \nsurface area of the peritoneal cavity is an ideal dialysis"

Once dialysis is completed, the fluid is drained.\nPeritoneal spread of disease\nThe large surface area of the peritoneal cavity allows infection and malignant disease to spread easily throughout the abdomen (Fig. 4.57). If malignant cells enter the \nperitoneal cavity by direct invasion (e.g., from colon or \novarian cancer), spread may be rapid. Similarly, a surgeon excising a malignant tumor and releasing malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity may cause an appreciable worsening of the patient\u2019s prognosis. Infection can also \nspread across the large surface area.\nThe peritoneal cavity can also act as a barrier to, and \ncontainer of, disease. Intraabdominal infection therefore \ntends to remain below the diaphragm rather than spread \ninto other body cavities.\nPerforated bowel\nA perforated bowel (e.g., caused by a perforated duodenal \nulcer) often leads to the release of gas into the peritoneal cavity. This peritoneal gas can be easily visualized on an \nerect chest radiograph\u2014gas can be demonstrated in \nextremely small amounts beneath the diaphragm.

This may predispose these people to esophageal ulceration and is also associated with an \nincreased risk of adenocarcinoma. In certain conditions, \nlike gastroesophageal reflux, the stratified squamous epithelium in the esophagus can undergo metaplasia and the epithelium in the lower esophagus is replaced by \ncolumnar epithelium, a condition called Barrett\u2019s \nesophagus. The presence of Barrett\u2019s esophagus predisposes these people to the development of esophageal malignancy (adenocarcinoma).Fig. 4.71  Ar terial supply to the ileum. \nJejunal and ileal arteriesSuperior mesenteric artery\nIn the clinic\nDuodenal ulceration\nDuodenal ulcers usually occur in the superior part of the duodenum and are much less common than they were 50 years ago. At first, there was no treatment and patients died \nfrom hemorrhage or peritonitis. As surgical techniques \ndeveloped, patients with duodenal ulcers were subjected to extensive upper gastrointestinal surgery to prevent ulcer recurrence and for some patients the treatment was dangerous. As knowledge and understanding of the \nmechanisms for acid secretion in the stomach increased, \ndrugs were developed to block acid stimulation and secretion indirectly (histamine H\n2-receptor antagonists) and \nthese have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality rates of this disease. Pharmacological therapy can now \ndirectly inhibit the cells of the stomach that produce acid \nwith, for example, proton pump inhibitors. Patients are also screened for the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which when \neradicated (by antibiotic treatment) significantly reduces duodenal ulcer formation.\nAnatomically, duodenal ulcers tend to occur either \nanteriorly or posteriorly.Posterior duodenal ulcers erode either directly onto the \ngastroduodenal artery or, more commonly, onto the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, which can \nproduce torrential hemorrhage, which may be fatal in some \npatients. Treatment may involve extensive upper abdominal surgery with ligation of the vessels or by endovascular means whereby the radiologist may place a very fine \ncatheter retrogradely from the femoral artery into the celiac \nartery. The common hepatic artery and the gastroduodenal artery are cannulated and the bleeding area may be blocked using small coils, which stem the flow of blood.\nAnterior duodenal ulcers erode into the peritoneal  \ncavity, causing peritonitis. This intense inflammatory reaction and the local ileus promote adhesion of the greater omentum, which attempts to seal off the perforation. The stomach and duodenum usually contain considerable amounts of gas, which enters the peritoneal cavity and can \nbe observed on a chest radiograph of an erect patient as \nsubdiaphragmatic gas. In most instances, treatment for the ulcer perforation is surgical."

            "Text": "Regional Anatomy  \u2022  Abdominal Viscera\n 4\n313In the clinic\nExamination of the upper and lower  \ngastrointestinal tract\nIt is often necessary to examine the esophagus, stomach, \nduodenum, proximal jejunum, and colon for disease. After taking an appropriate history and examining the patient, \nmost physicians arrange a series of simple blood tests to \nlook for bleeding, inflammation, and tumors. The next steps in the investigation assess the three components of any loop of bowel, namely, the lumen, the wall, and masses extrinsic to the bowel, which may compress or erode into it.\nExamination of the bowel lumen\nBarium sulfate solutions may be swallowed by the patient and can be visualized using an X-ray fluoroscopy unit. The lumen can be examined for masses (e.g., polyps and \ntumors) and peristaltic waves can be assessed. Patients may \nalso be given carbon dioxide\u2013releasing granules to fill the stomach so that the barium thinly coats the mucosa, resulting in images displaying fine mucosal detail. These tests are relatively simple and can be used to image the \nesophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small bowel. For \nimaging the large bowel, a barium enema can be used to introduce barium sulfate into the colon. Colonoscopy and CT colonography are also used.\nExamination of the bowel wall and extrinsic masses\nEndoscopy is a minimally invasive diagnostic medical procedure that can be used to assess the interior surfaces  \nof an organ by inserting a tube into the body. The \ninstrument is typically made of a flexible plastic material \nthrough which a light source and eyepiece are attached at one end. The images are then projected to a monitor. Some systems allow passage of small instruments through the main bore of the endoscope to obtain biopsies and to also \nundertake small procedures (e.g., the removal of polyps).\nIn gastrointestinal and abdominal medicine an endoscope \nis used to assess the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and \nproximal small bowel (Figs. 4.72 to 4.75). The tube is \nswallowed by the patient under light sedation and is \nextremely well tolerated.\nAssessment of the colon (colonoscopy) is performed by \npassage of the long flexible tube through the anus and into the rectum. The endoscope is then advanced into the colon \nto the cecum and sometimes to the terminal ileum. The \npatient undergoes bowel preparation before the examination to allow good visualization of the entire large bowel. Specially designed solutions are taken orally to help clear the bowel of fecal material. Air, water, and suction may be used during the examination to improve visualization. Biopsies, polyp removal, cauterization of bleeding, and stent placement can also be performed using additional \ninstruments that can be passed through special openings in \nthe colonoscope.\nCross sectional imaging using computed tomography or \nmagnetic resonance is another way to assess the bowel lumen and wall. Magnetic resonance is particularly useful in \nassessment of the small bowel because it allows dynamic \nassessment of bowel distention and motility and provides good visualization of segmental or continuous bowel wall thickening and mural or mucosal ulcerations and also can demonstrate increased vascularity of the small bowel \nmesentery (Fig. 4.76). It is usually performed in patients with \ninflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn\u2019s disease.\nCT colonography\nCT colonography (also called virtual colonoscopy or CT pneumocolon) is an alternative way to visualize and assess the colon for abnormal lesions such as polyps or strictures \nwith the use spiral CT to produce high-resolution 3D views of \nthe large bowel. It is less invasive than traditional colonoscopy, but to achieve good-quality images the patient needs to take bowel preparations to ensure bowel cleansing, and the colon needs to be insufflated with CO\n2. If a tumor is \npresent (Fig. 4.77), both CT and MRI are used to assess regional disease (MRI), abnormal lymph nodes (MRI, CT), and \ndistant metastases (CT).\nFig. 4.72  The endosc ope is a flexible plastic tube that can be \ncontrolled from the proximal end. Through a side portal various \ndevices can be inserted, which run through the endoscope  \nand can be used to obtain biopsies and to perform minor endoluminal surgical procedures (e.g., excision of polyps). \n(continues)"

Chronic gastric inflammation (gastritis), pernicious anemia, and polyps predispose to the \ndevelopment of this aggressive cancer, which is usually \nnot diagnosed until late in the course of the disease. Symptoms include vague epigastric pain, early fullness with eating, bleeding leading to chronic anemia, and obstruction.\nThe diagnosis may be made using barium and \nconventional radiology or endoscopy, which allows a biopsy to be obtained at the same time. Ultrasound scanning is used to check the liver for metastatic spread, \nand, if negative, computed tomography is carried out to \nassess for surgical resectability. If carcinoma of the stomach is diagnosed early, a curative surgical resection is possible. However, because most patients do not seek treatment until late in the disease, the overall 5-year \nsurvival rate is between 5% and 20%, with a mean \nsurvival time of between 5 and 8 months.In the clinic\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI)\nThese imaging techniques can provide important \ninformation about the wall of the bowel that may not be obtained from barium or endoscopic studies. Thickening \nof the wall may indicate inflammatory change or tumor \nand is always regarded with suspicion. If a tumor is demonstrated, the locoregional spread can be assessed, along with lymphadenopathy and metastatic spread.\nAdvanced imaging methods\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS) uses a small ultrasound device placed on the end of the endoscope to assess the upper gastrointestinal tract. It can produce extremely \nhigh-powered views of the mucosa and submucosa and \ntherefore show whether a tumor is resectable. It also provides guidance to the clinician when taking a biopsy."

A number of developmental anomalies can occur during gut development, many of which appear in the neonate or infant, and some of which are surgical emergencies. Occasionally, such disorders are diagnosed \nonly in adults.\nMalrotation and midgut volvulus\nMalrotation is incomplete rotation and fixation of the midgut \nafter it has passed from the umbilical sac and returned to the abdominal coelom (Figs. 4.93 and 4.94). The proximal attachment of the small bowel mesentery begins at the suspensory muscle of duodenum (ligament of Treitz) , which \ndetermines the position of the duodenojejunal junction. The \nmesentery of the small bowel ends at the level of the \nileocecal junction in the right lower quadrant. This long line of fixation of the mesentery prevents accidental twists of  \nthe gut.\nIf the duodenojejunal flexure or the cecum does not end \nup in its usual site, the origin of the small bowel mesentery shortens, which permits twisting of the small bowel around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. Twisting of the bowel, in general, is termed volvulus. Volvulus of the small \nbowel may lead to a reduction of blood flow and infarction.\nIn some patients, the cecum ends up in the \nmidabdomen. From the cecum and the right side of the colon a series of peritoneal folds ( Ladd\u2019s bands) develop that \nextend to the right undersurface of the liver and compress \nthe duodenum. A small bowel volvulus may then occur as \nwell as duodenal obstruction. Emergency surgery may be necessary to divide the bands.\nFig. 4.93  Small bowel malr otation and volvulus.

Mechanical obstruction is caused by an intraluminal, mural, or extrinsic mass which can be \nsecondary to a foreign body, obstructing tumor in the wall, \nor extrinsic compression from an adhesion, or embryological band (Fig. 4.95).\nA functional obstruction is usually due to an inability of \nthe bowel to peristalse, which again has a number of causes, \nand most frequently is a postsurgical state due to excessive \nintraoperative bowel handling. Other causes may well include abnormality of electrolytes (e.g., sodium and potassium) rendering the bowel paralyzed until correction \nhas occurred.\nThe signs and symptoms of obstruction depend on the \nlevel at which the obstruction has occurred. The primary \nsymptom is central abdominal, intermittent, colicky pain as the peristaltic waves try to overcome the obstruction. \nAbdominal distention will occur if it is a low obstruction \n(distal), allowing more proximal loops of bowel to fill with fluid. A high obstruction (in the proximal small bowel) may not produce abdominal distention.\nVomiting and absolute constipation, including the \ninability to pass flatus, will ensue.\nEarly diagnosis is important because considerable fluid \nand electrolytes enter the bowel lumen and fail to be reabsorbed, which produces dehydration and electrolyte \nabnormalities. Furthermore, the bowel continues to distend, \ncompromising the blood supply within the bowel wall, which may lead to ischemia and perforation. The symptoms and signs are variable and depend on the level of obstruction.\nSmall bowel obstruction is typically caused by adhesions \nfollowing previous surgery, and history should always be sought for any operations or abdominal interventions (e.g., previous appendectomy). Other causes include bowel \npassing into hernias (e.g., inguinal) and bowel twisting  \non its own mesentery (volvulus). Examination of hernial \norifices is mandatory in patients with bowel obstruction  \n(Fig. 4.96).\nFig. 4.95  This radiograph of the abdomen, ant eroposterior view, \ndemonstrates a number of dilated loops of small bowel.

The \nsigmoid colon has the smallest diameter of any portion of \nthe colon and is therefore the site where intraluminal pressure is potentially the highest. Poor dietary fiber intake and obesity are also linked to diverticular disease.\nThe presence of multiple diverticula does not necessarily \nmean the patient requires any treatment. Moreover, many patients have no other symptoms or signs.Patients tend to develop symptoms and signs when the \nneck of the diverticulum becomes obstructed by feces and \nbecomes infected. Inflammation may spread along the wall, \ncausing abdominal pain. When the sigmoid colon becomes inflamed (diverticulitis), abdominal pain and fever ensue  \n(Fig. 4.100).\nBecause of the anatomical position of the sigmoid colon \nthere are a number of complications that may occur. The diverticula can perforate to form an abscess in the pelvis. The inflammation may produce an inflammatory mass, obstructing the left ureter. Inflammation may also spread to the bladder, producing a fistula between the sigmoid colon \nand the bladder. In these circumstances patients may \ndevelop a urinary tract infection and rarely have fecal material and gas passing per urethra.\nThe diagnosis is based upon clinical examination and \noften CT scanning.

Externalization of bowel plays \nan important role in patient management. These \nextraanatomical bypass procedures use our anatomical \nknowledge and in many instances are life saving.\nGastrostomy\nGastrostomy is performed when the stomach is attached  \nto the anterior abdominal wall and a tube is placed through \nthe skin into the stomach. Typically this is performed to  \nfeed the patient when it is impossible to take food and fluid \norally (e.g., complex head and neck cancer). The procedure \ncan be performed either surgically or through a direct \nneedlestick puncture under sedation in the anterior \nabdominal wall.\nJejunostomy\nSimilarly the jejunum is brought to the anterior abdominal \nwall and fixed. The jejunostomy is used as a site where a \nfeeding tube is placed through the anterior abdominal wall \ninto the proximal efferent small bowel.\nIleostomy\nAn ileostomy is performed when small bowel contents need \nto be diverted from the distal bowel. An ileostomy is often \nperformed to protect a distal surgical anastomosis, such as in \nthe colon to allow healing after surgery.\nColostomy\nThere are a number of instances when a colostomy may be \nnecessary. In many circumstances it is performed to protect the distal large bowel after surgery. A further indication \nwould include large bowel obstruction with imminent \nperforation wherein a colostomy allows decompression of \nthe bowel and its contents. This is a safe and temporizing \nprocedure performed when the patient is too unwell for \nextensive bowel surgery. It is relatively straightforward and \ncarries reduced risk, preventing significant morbidity and \nmortality.\nAn end colostomy is necessary when the patient has \nundergone a surgical resection of the rectum and anus \n(typically for cancer).\nIleal conduit\nAn ileal conduit is an extraanatomical procedure and is \nperformed after resection of the bladder for tumor. In this \nsituation a short segment of small bowel is identified. The \nbowel is divided twice to produce a 20-cm segment of small \nbowel on its own mesentery. This isolated segment of bowel \nis used as a conduit. The remaining bowel is joined together. \nThe proximal end is anastomosed to the ureters, and the \ndistal end is anastomosed to the anterior abdominal wall. \nHence, urine passes from the kidneys into the ureters and \nthrough the short segment of small bowel to the anterior \nabdominal wall.\nWhen patients have either an ileostomy, colostomy, or \nileal conduit it is necessary for them to fix a collecting bag \nonto the anterior abdominal wall. Contrary to one\u2019s initial \nthoughts these bags are tolerated extremely well by most \npatients and allow patients to live a nearly normal and \nhealthy life."

They consist of a variety of components but are predominantly a \nmixture of cholesterol and bile pigment. They may undergo \ncalcification, which can be demonstrated on plain radiographs. Gallstones may be visualized incidentally as part of a routine abdominal ultrasound scan (Fig. 4.117) or on a plain radiograph.\nThe easiest way to confirm the presence of gallstones is \nby performing a fasting ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. The patient refrains from eating for 6 hours to ensure the gallbladder is well distended and there is little \nshadowing from overlying bowel gas. The examination may \nalso identify bile duct dilation and the presence of cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is another way to image the gallbladder and biliary tree. MRCP uses fluid present in the bile ducts and in the \npancreatic duct as a contrast agent to show stones as well as \nfilling defects within the gallbladder and intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. It can demonstrate strictures in the biliary tree and can also be used to visualize liver and pancreatic anatomy (Fig. 4.118).\nFrom time to time, gallstones impact in the region of \nHartmann\u2019s pouch, which is a bulbous region of the neck of the gallbladder. When the gallstone lodges in this area, the gallbladder cannot empty normally and contractions of the gallbladder wall produce severe pain. If this persists, a cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) may be necessary.\nSometimes the gallbladder may become inflamed \n(cholecystitis). If the inflammation involves the related parietal peritoneum of the diaphragm, pain may not only occur in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen but may also be referred to the shoulder on the right side. This \nreferred pain is due to the innervation of the visceral \nperitoneum of the diaphragm by spinal cord levels (C3 to C5) that also innervate skin over the shoulder. In this case, one somatic sensory region of low sensory output (diaphragm) is referred to another somatic sensory region of high sensory \noutput (dermatomes).\nFrom time to time, small gallstones pass into the bile \nduct and are trapped in the region of the sphincter of the \nampulla, which obstructs the flow of bile into the \nduodenum.

It may be associated with left lower rib fractures. Because the spleen has such an extremely thin \ncapsule, it is susceptible to injury even when there is no \ndamage to surrounding structures, and because the spleen is highly vascular, when ruptured, it bleeds profusely into the peritoneal cavity. Splenic rupture should always be suspected with blunt abdominal injury. Current treatments \npreserve as much of the spleen as possible, but some \npatients require splenectomy.\nSplenic enlargement\nThe spleen is an organ of the reticuloendothelial system involved in hematopoiesis and immunological surveillance. Diseases that affect the reticuloendothelial system (e.g., \nleukemia or lymphoma) may produce generalized \nlymphadenopathy and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) (Fig. 4.120). The spleen often enlarges when performing its normal physiological functions, such as when clearing microorganisms and particulates from the \ncirculation, producing increased antibodies in the course of \nsepsis, or removing deficient or destroyed erythrocytes (e.g., in thalassemia and spherocytosis). Splenomegaly may also be a result of increased venous pressure caused by \ncongestive heart failure, splenic vein thrombosis, or portal \nhypertension. An enlarged spleen is prone to rupture.\nFig. 4.120  C oronal CT of the abdomen containing a massively \nenlarged spleen (splenomegaly). \nSpleen LiverIn the clinic\nJaundice\nJaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin caused by excess bile pigment (bilirubin) within the plasma. The yellow color is best appreciated by looking at the normally white \nsclerae of the eyes, which turn yellow.\nThe extent of the elevation of the bile pigments and the \nduration for which they have been elevated account for the \nseverity of jaundice.\nSimplified explanation to understanding the types of \njaundice and their anatomical causes\nWhen red blood cells are destroyed by the \nreticuloendothelial system, the iron from the hemoglobin molecule is recycled, whereas the porphyrin ring (globin) \ncompounds are broken down to form fat-soluble bilirubin. \nOn reaching the liver via the bloodstream, the fat-soluble bilirubin is converted to a water-soluble form of bilirubin. This water-soluble bilirubin is secreted into the biliary tree and then in turn into the bowel, where it forms the dark color of the stool.\nPrehepatic jaundice\nThis type of jaundice is usually produced by conditions where there is an excessive breakdown of red blood cells (e.g., in incompatible blood transfusion and hemolytic anemia).\nHepatic jaundice\nThe complex biochemical reactions for converting fat-soluble into water-soluble bilirubin may be affected by inflammatory change within the liver (e.g., from hepatitis or chronic liver \ndisease, such as liver cirrhosis) and poisons (e.g., \nparacetamol overdose).\nPosthepatic jaundice\nAny obstruction of the biliary tree can produce jaundice, but the two most common causes are gallstones within the bile duct and an obstructing tumor at the head of the pancreas."

It is the small -\nest of  the three anterior branches of  the abdominal aorta and arises anterior to the body of  vertebra LIII. Initially , the inferior mesenteric artery descends anteriorly to the aorta and then passes to the left as it continues inferiorly (Fig. 4.128). Its branches include the left colic artery, several \nsigmoid arteries, and the superior rectal artery.\nLeft colic artery\nThe left colic artery is the first branch of  the inferior mes -\nenteric artery (Fig. 4.128). It ascends retroperitoneally , dividing into ascending and descending branches:\n\u25a0 The ascending branch passes anteriorly to the left \nkidney , then enters the transverse mesocolon, and passes superiorly to supply the upper part of  the descending colon and the distal part of  the transverse colon; it anastomoses with branches of  the middle colic artery .\n\u25a0 The descending br anch passes inferiorly , supplying the \nlower part of  the descending colon, and anastomoses with the first sigmoid artery .\nSigmoid arteries\nThe sigmoid arteries consist of  two to four branches, which descend to the left, in the sigmoid mesocolon, to supply the lowest part of  the descending colon and the sigmoid colon (Fig. 4.128). These branches anastomose superiorly with branches from the left colic artery and inferiorly with branches from the superior rectal artery .\nSuperior rectal artery\nThe terminal branch of  the inferior mesenteric artery  \nis the superior rectal artery (Fig. 4.128). This vessel descends into the pelvic cavity in the sigmoid mesocolon, crossing the left common iliac vessels. Opposite vertebra SIII, the superior rectal artery divides. The two terminal branches descend on each side of  the rectum, dividing into smaller branches in the wall of  the rectum. These smaller branches continue inferiorly to the level of  the internal anal sphincter, anastomosing along the way with branches from the middle rectal arteries (from the internal iliac artery) and the inferior rectal arteries (from the internal pudendal artery).of  arcades moving into and through the area of  the ileum. Extending from the terminal arcade are vasa recta (straight arteries), which provide the final direct vascular supply to the walls of  the small intestine. The vasa recta supplying the jejunum are usually long and close together, forming narrow windows visible in the mesentery . The vasa recta supplying the ileum are generally short and far apart, forming low broad windows.\nMiddle colic artery\nThe middle colic artery is the first of  the three branches from the right side of  the main trunk of  the superior mes -\nenteric artery (Fig. 4.127). Arising as the superior mesen -\nteric artery emerges from beneath the pancreas, the middle colic artery enters the transverse mesocolon and divides into right and left branches. The right branch anastomoses with the right colic artery while the left branch anastomo -\nses with the left colic artery , which is a branch of  the inferior mesenteric artery .\nRight colic artery\nContinuing distally along the main trunk of  the superior mesenteric artery , the right colic artery is the second of  the three branches from the right side of  the main trunk of  the superior mesenteric artery (Fig. 4.126). It is an inconsis -\ntent branch, and passes to the right in a retroperitoneal position to supply the ascending colon. Nearing the colon, it divides into a descending branch, which anastomoses with the ileocolic artery , and an ascending branch, which anastomoses with the middle colic artery .\nIleocolic artery\nThe final branch arising from the right side of  the superior mesenteric artery is the ileocolic artery (Fig. 4.127). This passes downward and to the right toward the right iliac fossa where it divides into superior and inferior branches:\n\u25a0 The superior br anch passes upward along the ascending \ncolon to anastomose with the right colic artery .\n\u25a0 The inf erior branch continues toward the ileocolic junc -\ntion, dividing into colic, cecal, appendicular, and ileal branches (Fig. 4.127).\nThe specific pattern of  distribution and origin of  these \nbranches is variable:\n\u25a0 The colic br anch crosses to the ascending colon and \npasses upward to supply the first part of  the ascending \ncolon.\n\u25a0 Anterior and posterior cecal br anches, arising either as \na common trunk or as separate branches, supply cor -\nresponding sides of  the cecum."

It \nis unusual for this area to become ischemic, whereas the \nwatershed area between the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery, at the splenic flexure, is extremely vulnerable to ischemia.\nIn certain disease states, the region of the splenic flexure \nof the colon can become ischemic.

Additional tributaries include:\n\u25a0 the right gastro-omental vein, draining the right \npart of  the greater curvature of  the stomach, and\n\u25a0 the anterior and posterior inferior pancreatico -\nduodenal veins, which pass alongside the arteries of  the same name; the anterior superior pancreaticoduo-denal vein usually empties into the right gastro-omental vein, and the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein usually empties directly into the portal vein.Inferior mesenteric vein\nThe inferior mesenteric vein  drains blood from the \nrectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, and splenic flexure (Fig. 4.132). It begins as the superior rectal vein  \nand ascends, receiving tributaries from the sigmoid veins and the left colic vein . All these veins accompany arteries \nof  the same name. Continuing to ascend, the inferior mesenteric vein passes posterior to the body of  the pancreas and usually joins the splenic vein. Occasionally , it ends at the junction of  the splenic and superior mesenteric veins or joins the superior mesenteric vein.\nIn the clinic\nHepatic cirrhosis\nCirrhosis is a complex disorder of the liver, the diagnosis of \nwhich is confirmed histologically. When a diagnosis is suspected, a liver biopsy is necessary.\nCirrhosis is characterized by widespread hepatic fibrosis \ninterspersed with areas of nodular regeneration and abnormal reconstruction of preexisting lobular architecture. The presence of cirrhosis implies previous or continuing liver cell damage.\nThe etiology of cirrhosis is complex and includes toxins \n(alcohol), viral inflammation, biliary obstruction, vascular outlet obstruction, nutritional (malnutrition) causes, and inherited anatomical and metabolic disorders.\nAs the cirrhosis progresses, the intrahepatic vasculature  \nis distorted, which in turn leads to increased pressure in  \nthe portal vein and its draining tributaries (portal hypertension). Portal hypertension produces increased pressure in the splenic venules, leading to splenic \nenlargement. At the sites of portosystemic anastomosis  \n(see below), large dilated veins (varices) develop. These \nveins are susceptible to bleeding and may produce  \nmarked blood loss, which in some instances can  \nbe fatal.\nThe liver is responsible for the production of numerous \nproteins, including those of the clotting cascade. Any disorder of the liver (including infection and cirrhosis) may decrease the production of these proteins and so prevent adequate blood clotting. Patients with severe cirrhosis of the \nliver have a significant risk of serious bleeding, even from small cuts; in addition, when varices rupture, there is a \ndanger of rapid exsanguination.\nAs the liver progressively fails, the patient develops salt \nand water retention, which produces skin and subcutaneous edema. Fluid (ascites) is also retained in the peritoneal cavity, which can hold many liters.\nThe poorly functioning liver cells (hepatocytes) are unable \nto break down blood and blood products, leading to an increase in the serum bilirubin level, which manifests as jaundice.\nWith the failure of normal liver metabolism, toxic \nmetabolic by-products do not convert to nontoxic \nmetabolites. This buildup of noxious compounds is made \nworse by the numerous portosystemic shunts, which allow the toxic metabolites to bypass the liver. Patients may develop severe neurological features, called hepatic encephalopathy, that can manifest as acute confusion, \nepileptic fits, or psychotic state.\nHepatic encephalopathy is one of the urgent criteria for \nliver transplantation; if the condition is not reversed, it leads \nto irreversible neurological damage and death.\nPortosystemic anastomosis\nThe hepatic portal system drains blood from the visceral organs of the abdomen to the liver. In normal individuals, 100% of the portal venous blood flow can be recovered \nfrom the hepatic veins, whereas in patients with elevated \nportal vein pressure (e.g., from cirrhosis), there is significantly less blood flow to the liver.

There are usually:\n\u25a0 three g anglia in the cervical region,\n\u25a0 elev en or twelve ganglia in the thoracic region,\n\u25a0 four g anglia in the lumbar region,\n\u25a0 four or fiv e ganglia in the sacral region, and\n\u25a0 the g anglion impar anterior to the coccyx (Fig. 4.135).\nThe ganglia and trunks are connected to adjacent spinal \nnerves by gray rami communicantes throughout the length of  the sympathetic trunk and by white rami com-municantes in the thoracic and upper lumbar parts of  the trunk (T1 to L2). Neuronal fibers found in the sympathetic trunks include preganglionic and postganglionic sym-\npathetic fibers and visceral afferent fibers.\nSplanchnic nerves\nThe splanchnic nerves are important components in the innervation of  the abdominal viscera. They pass from the sympathetic trunk or sympathetic ganglia associated with the trunk, to the prevertebral plexus and ganglia anterior to the abdominal aorta.\nThere are two different types of  splanchnic nerves, \ndepending on the type of  visceral efferent fiber they are carrying:\n\u25a0 The thor acic, lumbar, and sacral splanchnic nerves \ncarry preganglionic sympathetic fibers from the sympa -\nthetic trunk to ganglia in the prevertebral plexus, and also visceral afferent fibers.\n\u25a0 The pelvic splanchnic ner ves carry preganglionic para -\nsympathetic fibers from anterior rami of  S2, S3, and S4 spinal nerves to an extension of  the prevertebral plexus in the pelvis (the inferior hypogastric plexus or \npelvic plexus).\nThoracic splanchnic nerves\nThree thoracic splanchnic nerves pass from sympa -\nthetic ganglia along the sympathetic trunk in the thorax to the prevertebral plexus and ganglia associated with the abdominal aorta in the abdomen (Fig. 4.136):\n\u25a0 The g reater splanchnic nerve arises from the fifth to the \nninth (or tenth) thoracic ganglia and travels to the Sympathetic trunks\nThe sympathetic trunks are two parallel nerve cords extending on either side of  the vertebral column from the base of  the skull to the coccyx (Fig. 4.135).

They are the only splanchnic nerves that carry parasympathetic fibers. In other words, they do not origi-nate from the sympathetic trunks. Rather, they originate directly from the anterior rami of  S2 to S4. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord pass from the S2 to S4 spinal nerves to the inferior hypo-gastric plexus (Fig. 4.136). Once in this plexus, some of  these fibers pass upward, enter the abdominal prevertebral plexus, and distribute with the arteries supplying the hindgut. This provides the pathway for innervation of  the distal one-third of  the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon by preganglionic parasympa -\nthetic fibers.\nAbdominal prevertebral plexus and ganglia\nThe abdominal prevertebral plexus is a collection of  nerve fibers that surrounds the abdominal aorta and is continu -\nous onto its major branches. Scattered throughout the length of  the abdominal prevertebral plexus are cell bodies of  postganglionic sympathetic fibers. Some of  these cell bodies are organized into distinct ganglia, while others are more random in their distribution. The ganglia are usually associated with specific branches of  the abdominal aorta and named after these branches.\nThe three major divisions of  the abdominal prevertebral \nplexus and associated ganglia are the celiac, aortic, and superior hypogastric plexuses (Fig. 4.137).\u25a0 The celiac ple xus is the large accumulation of  nerve \nfibers and ganglia associated with the roots of  the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery immediately below the aortic hiatus of  the diaphragm. Ganglia associated with the celiac plexus include two celiac ganglia, a single superior mesenteric ganglion, and two aorticorenal ganglia.\n\u25a0 The aor tic plexus consists of  nerve fibers and associated \nganglia on the anterior and lateral surfaces of  the abdominal aorta extending from just below the origin of  the superior mesenteric artery to the bifurcation of  the aorta into the two common iliac arteries. The major ganglion in this plexus is the inferior mesenteric gan -\nglion at the root of  the inferior mesenteric artery .\n\u25a0 The superior h ypogastric plexus contains numerous \nsmall ganglia and is the final part of  the abdominal prevertebral plexus before the prevertebral plexus con-tinues into the pelvic cavity .\nEach of  these major plexuses gives origin to a number \nof  secondary plexuses, which may also contain small \nganglia. These plexuses are usually named after the vessels with which they are associated. For example, the celiac plexus is usually described as giving origin to the superior mesenteric plexus and the renal plexus, as well as other plexuses that extend out along the various branches of  the celiac trunk. Similarly , the aortic plexus has secondary plexuses consisting of  the inferior mesenteric plexus, the spermatic plexus, and the external iliac plexus.\nInferiorly , the superior hypogastric plexus divides into \nthe hypogastric nerves, which descend into the pelvis \nand contribute to the formation of  the inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexus (Fig. 4.137).\nThe abdominal prevertebral plexus receives:\n\u25a0 preg anglionic parasympathetic and visceral afferent \nfibers from the vagus nerves [X],\n\u25a0 preg anglionic sympathetic and visceral afferent fibers \nfrom the thoracic and lumbar splanchnic nerves, and\n\u25a0 preg anglionic parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic \nsplanchnic nerves.\nParasympathetic innervation\nParasympathetic innervation of  the abdominal part of  the gastrointestinal tract and of  the spleen, pancreas, gallblad-der, and liver is from two sources\u2014the vagus nerves [X] and the pelvic splanchnic nerves."

This type of surgery has become \nincreasingly popular over the last few years for patients who \nare unable to achieve significant weight loss through \nappropriate diet modification and exercise programs. It is \noften regarded as a last resort. Importantly, we have to \nrecognize the increasing medical impact that overweight \npatients pose. With obesity the patient is more likely to \ndevelop diabetes and cardiovascular problems and may \nsuffer from increased general health disorders. All of these \nhave a significant impact on health care budgeting and are \nregarded as serious conditions for the \u201chealth of a nation.\u201d\nThere are a number of surgical options to treat obesity. \nSurgery for patients who are morbidly obese can be \ncategorized into two main groups: malabsorptive procedures \nand restrictive procedures. \nMalabsorptive procedures\nThere are a variety of bypass procedures that produce a \nmalabsorption state, preventing further weight gain and also \nproducing weight loss. There are complications, which may \ninclude anemia, osteoporosis, and diarrhea (e.g., jejunoileal \nbypass).Predominantly restrictive procedures\nRestrictive procedures involve placing a band or stapling in \nor around the stomach to decrease the size of the organ. \nThis reduction produces an earlier feeling of satiety and \nprevents the patient from overeating.\nCombination procedure\nProbably the most popular procedure currently in the United \nStates is gastric bypass surgery. This procedure involves \nstapling the proximal stomach and joining a loop of small \nbowel to the small gastric remnant. The procedure is usually \nperformed by fashioning a Roux-en-Y loop with alimentary \nand pancreaticobiliary limbs.\nThe other type of the procedure, sleeve gastrectomy, is \nincreasing in popularity because it can be used in patients \ndeemed to be at high risk for gastric bypass surgery. It \ninvolves reduction of the gastric lumen by removing a large \nportion of the stomach along the greater curvature.\nAny overweight patient undergoing surgery faces \nsignificant risk and increased morbidity, with mortality rates \nfrom 1% to 5%."

The physiological effect of  these changes is that air enters the lungs and venous return to the heart is enhanced.\nBlood supply\nThere is blood supply to the diaphragm on its superior and inferior surfaces:\n\u25a0 Superiorl y , the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic \narteries, both branches of  the internal thoracic artery , and the superior phrenic artery , a branch of  the thoracic aorta, supply the diaphragm.\n\u25a0 Inf eriorly , the inferior phrenic arteries, branches of  the \nabdominal aorta, supply the diaphragm (see Fig. 4.143).\nVenous drainage is through companion veins to these \narteries.\nInnervation\nInnervation of  the diaphragm is primarily by the phrenic \nnerves. These nerves, from the C3 to C5 spinal cord levels, provide all motor innervation to the diaphragm and sensory fibers to the central part. They pass through the thoracic cavity , between the mediastinal pleura and the pericardium, to the superior surface of  the diaphragm. At this point, the right phrenic nerve accompanies the inferior vena cava through the diaphragm and the left phrenic nerve passes through the diaphragm by itself  (see  \nFig. 4.143). Additional sensory fibers are supplied to the peripheral areas of  the diaphragm by intercostal nerves.Domes\nThe classic appearance of  the right and left domes of  the diaphragm is caused by the underlying abdominal contents pushing these lateral areas upward, and by the fibrous pericardium, which is attached centrally , causing a flatten -\ning of  the diaphragm in this area (Fig. 4.145).\nThe domes are produced by:\n\u25a0 the li ver on the right, with some contribution from the \nright kidney and the right suprarenal gland, and\n\u25a0 the fundus of  the stomach and spleen on the left, with \ncontributions from the left kidney and the left suprare -\nnal gland.\nAlthough the height of  these domes varies during \nbreathing, a reasonable estimate in normal expiration \nplaces the left dome at the fifth intercostal space and the right dome at rib V . This is important to remember when percussing the thorax.\nDuring inspiration, the muscular part of  the diaphragm \ncontracts, causing the central tendon of  the diaphragm to be drawn inferiorly . This results in some flattening of  the \nFig. 4.145  Right and lef t domes of the diaphragm.

The psoas muscle and its sheath arise not \nonly from the lumbar vertebrae but also from the \nintervertebral discs between each vertebra. This disc origin is of critical importance. In certain types of infection, the intervertebral disc is preferentially affected (e.g., tuberculosis and salmonella discitis). As the infection of \nthe disc develops, the infection spreads anteriorly and \nanterolaterally. In the anterolateral position, the infection passes into the psoas muscle sheath, and spreads within the muscle and sheath, and may appear below the \ninguinal ligament as a mass."

This venous extension is rare for any other type of tumor, so, when seen, renal cell carcinoma should be \nsuspected. In addition, the tumor may spread along the \nrenal vein and into the inferior vena cava, and in rare cases can grow into the right atrium across the tricuspid valve and into the pulmonary artery.\nTreatment for most renal cancers is surgical removal, \neven when metastatic spread is present, because some patients show regression of metastases.\nTransitional cell carcinoma arises from the urothelium. \nThe urothelium is present from the calices to the urethra and behaves as a \u201csingle unit.\u201d Therefore, when patients develop \ntransitional carcinomas within the bladder, similar tumors \nFig. 4.158  T umor in the right kidney spreading into the right \nrenal vein.

Access to the kidney is relatively straightforward, because the kidney can be easily visualized under ultrasound guidance.

The living donors are carefully assessed, because harvesting a kidney from a normal healthy individual, even with modern-day medicine, carries a small risk.\nDeceased kidney donors are brain dead or have suffered \ncardiac death. The donor kidney is harvested with a small cuff \nof aortic and venous tissue. The ureter is also harvested.\nAn ideal place to situate the transplant kidney is in the \nleft or the right iliac fossa (Fig. 4.161). A curvilinear incision is \nmade paralleling the iliac crest and pubic symphysis. The \nexternal oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus \nabdominis muscle, and transversalis fascia are divided. The surgeon identifies the parietal peritoneum but does not enter the peritoneal cavity. The parietal peritoneum is medially retracted to reveal the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, and bladder. In some instances the internal iliac artery of the recipient is mobilized and anastomosed directly \nas an end-to-end procedure onto the renal artery of the \ndonor kidney. Similarly the internal iliac vein is anastomosed to the donor vein. In the presence of a small aortic cuff of tissue the donor artery is anastomosed to the recipient external iliac artery and similarly for the venous anastomosis. \nThe ureter is easily tunneled obliquely through the bladder \nwall with a straightforward anastomosis.\nThe left and right iliac fossae are ideal locations for the \ntransplant kidney because a new space can be created without compromise to other structures.

Images are displayed \non a monitor, as done in other endoscopic studies. Biopsies, \nbladder stone removal, removal of foreign bodies from the bladder, and bleeding cauterization can be performed during cystoscopy.

The patient is injected with iodinated contrast medium. Most contrast \nmedia contain three iodine atoms spaced around a benzene \nring. The relatively high atomic number of iodine compared to the atomic number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen attenuates the radiation beam. After intravenous injection, contrast media are excreted predominantly by glomerular \nfiltration, although some are secreted by the renal tubules. \nThis allows visualization of the collecting system as well as the ureters and bladder.\nUltrasound\nUltrasound can be used to assess kidney size and the size of the calices, which may be dilated when obstructed. Although the ureters are poorly visualized using ultrasound, \nthe bladder can be easily seen when full. Ultrasound measurements of bladder volume can be obtained before \nand after micturition.\nNuclear medicine\nNuclear medicine is an extremely useful tool for investigating the urinary tract because radioisotope compounds can be used to estimate renal cell mass and \nfunction and assess the parenchyma for renal scarring. \nThese tests are often very useful in children when renal scarring and reflux disease is suspected.Fig. 4.162  C oronal view of 3-D urogram using multidetector \ncomputed tomography. \nLiver Right kidney\nRight ureterSpleen\nLeft kidney\nRenal pelvis\nPsoas majo r\nLeft ureter\nBladder"

As the aorta expands, the risk of \nrupture increases, and it is now generally accepted that when \nan aneurysm reaches 5.5  cm or greater an operation will \nsignificantly benefit the patient.\nWith the aging population, the number of abdominal \naortic aneurysms is increasing. Moreover, with the increasing use of imaging techniques, a number of abdominal aortic \naneurysms are identified in asymptomatic patients.\nFor many years the standard treatment for repair was an \nopen operative technique, which involved a large incision from the xiphoid process of the sternum to the symphysis \npubis and dissection of the aneurysm. The aneurysm was \nexcised and a tubular woven graft was sewn into place. Recovery may take a number of days, even weeks, and most patients would be placed in the intensive care unit \nafter the operation.Further developments and techniques have led to a new \ntype of procedure being performed to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms\u2014the endovascular graft (Fig. 4.165).\nThe technique involves surgically dissecting the femoral \nartery below the inguinal ligament. A small incision is made \nin the femoral artery and the preloaded compressed graft with metal support struts is passed on a large catheter into \nthe abdominal aorta through the femoral artery. Using X-ray \nfor guidance the graft is opened, lining the inside of the aorta. Limb attachments are made to the graft that extend into the common iliac vessels. This bifurcated tube device effectively excludes the abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nThis type of device is not suitable for all patients.  \nPatients who receive this device do not need to go to the intensive care unit. Many patients leave the hospital  \nwithin 24 to 48 hours. Importantly, this device can be used for patients who were deemed unfit for open surgical  \nrepair.\nFig. 4.165  V olume-rendered reconstruction using multidetector computed tomography of patient with an infrarenal abdominal aortic \naneurysm before (A) and after ( B) endovascular aneurysm repair.

Common predisposing factors include hospitalization and surgery, the oral contraceptive pill, smoking, and air travel. Other factors \ninclude clotting abnormalities (e.g., protein S and protein C \ndeficiency).\nThe diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis may be difficult \nto establish, with symptoms including leg swelling and \npain and discomfort in the calf. It may also be an \nincidental finding.\nIn practice, patients with suspected deep vein \nthrombosis undergo a D-dimer blood test, which measures levels of a fibrin degradation product. If this is positive \nthere is a high association with deep vein thrombosis.\nThe consequences of deep vein thrombosis are \ntwofold. Occasionally the clot may dislodge and pass into \nthe venous system through the right side of the heart and into the main pulmonary arteries. If the clots are of \nsignificant size they obstruct blood flow to the lung and \nmay produce instantaneous death. Secondary complications include destruction of the normal valvular system in the legs, which may lead to venous incompetency and chronic leg swelling with ulceration.\nThe treatment for deep vein thrombosis is prevention. \nIn order to prevent deep vein thrombosis, patients are optimized by removing all potential risk factors. Subcutaneous heparin may be injected and the patient \nwears compression stockings to prevent venous stasis \nwhile in the hospital.\nIn certain situations it is not possible to optimize the \npatient with prophylactic treatment, and it may be necessary to insert a filter into the inferior vena cava that \ntraps any large clots.

The pre-aortic lymph node group drains lymph from the embryological midline structures, \nsuch as the liver, bowel, and pancreas. The para-aortic \nlymph node group (the lateral aortic or lumbar nodes), on either side of the aorta, drain lymph from bilateral structures, such as the kidneys and adrenal glands. Organs embryologically derived from the posterior abdominal wall \nalso drain lymph to these nodes. These organs include the \novaries and the testes (importantly, the testes do not drain lymph to the inguinal regions).\nIn general, lymphatic drainage follows standard \npredictable routes; however, in the presence of disease, alternate routes of lymphatic drainage will occur.\nThere are a number of causes for enlarged retroperitoneal \nlymph nodes. In the adult, massively enlarged lymph nodes are a feature of lymphoma, and smaller lymph node \nenlargement is observed in the presence of infection and \nmetastatic malignant spread of disease (e.g., colon cancer).\nThe treatment for malignant lymph node disease is based \nupon a number of factors, including the site of the primary tumor (e.g., bowel) and its histological cell type. Normally, \nthe primary tumor is surgically removed and the lymph \nnode spread and metastatic organ spread (e.g., to the liver and the lungs) are often treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.In certain instances it may be considered appropriate to \nresect the lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum (e.g., for \ntesticular cancer).\nThe surgical approach to retroperitoneal lymph node \nresection involves a lateral paramedian incision in the \nmidclavicular line. The three layers of the anterolateral abdominal wall (external oblique, internal oblique, and \ntransversus abdominis) are opened and the transversalis \nfascia is divided. The next structure the surgeon sees is the parietal peritoneum. Instead of entering the parietal peritoneum, which is standard procedure for most intraabdominal operations, the surgeon gently pushes the \nparietal peritoneum toward the midline, which moves the \nintraabdominal contents and allows a clear view of the retroperitoneal structures. On the left, the para-aortic lymph node group is easily demonstrated, with a clear view of the \nabdominal aorta and kidney. On the right the inferior vena \ncava is demonstrated and has to be retracted to access the right para-aortic lymph node chain.\nThe procedure of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection  \nis extremely well tolerated and lacks the problems of \nentering the peritoneal cavity (e.g., paralytic ileus). \nUnfortunately, a complication of a vertical incision in the midclavicular line is division of the segmental nerve supply to the rectus abdominis muscle. This produces muscle atrophy and asymmetrical proportions of the anterior \nabdominal wall."

On the first patient he noted irregular veins \nradiating from the umbilicus. On the second patient he \nnoted irregular veins, coursing in a caudal to cranial \ndirection, over the anterior abdominal wall from the groin \nto the chest. He was asked to explain his findings and \ndetermine the significance of these features.\nIn the first patient the veins were draining radially away \nfrom the periumbilical region. In normal individuals, enlarged \nveins do not radiate from the umbilicus. In patients with \nportal hypertension the portal venous pressure is increased \nas a result of hepatic disease. Small collateral veins develop \nat and around the obliterated umbilical vein. These veins \npass through the umbilicus and drain onto the anterior \nabdominal wall, forming a portosystemic anastomosis. The \neventual diagnosis for this patient was cirrhosis of the liver.\nThe finding of veins draining in a caudocranial direction on \nthe anterior abdominal wall in the second patient is not typical for veins on the anterior abdominal wall. When veins \nare so prominent, it usually implies that there is an \nobstruction to the normal route of venous drainage and an \nalternative route has been taken. Typically, blood from the \nlower limbs and the retroperitoneal organs drains into  \nthe inferior vena cava and from here to the right atrium of \nthe heart. This patient had a chronic thrombosis of the \ninferior vena cava, preventing blood from returning to the \nheart by the \u201cusual\u201d route.\nBlood from the lower limbs and the pelvis may drain via a \nseries of collateral vessels, some of which include the \nsuperficial inferior epigastric veins, which run in the \nsuperficial fascia. These anastomose with the superior, \nsuperficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into \nthe internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the \nbrachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava.\nAfter the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of \nthe anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways \nhypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow.\nTRAUMATIC RUPTURE OF THE DIAPHRAGM\nA 45-year-old man had mild epigastric pain, and a diagnosis \nof esophageal reflux was made. He was given appropriate \nmedication, which worked well. However, at the time of the \ninitial consultation, the family practitioner requested a \nchest radiograph, which demonstrated a prominent hump \non the left side of the diaphragm and old rib fractures.\nThe patient was recalled for further questioning.\nHe was extremely pleased with the treatment he had been \ngiven for his gastroesophageal reflux, but was concerned \nabout being recalled for further history and examination. \nDuring the interview, he revealed that he had previously \nbeen involved in a motorcycle accident and had undergone a \nlaparotomy for a \u201crupture.\u201d The patient did not recall what \noperation was performed, but was assured at the time that \nthe operation was a great success.The patient is likely to have undergone a splenectomy.\nIn any patient who has had severe blunt abdominal trauma \n(such as that caused by a motorcycle accident), lower \nleft-sided rib fractures are an extremely important sign of \nappreciable trauma.\nA review of the patient\u2019s old notes revealed that at the time \nof the injury the spleen was removed surgically, but it was \nnot appreciated that there was a small rupture of the dome \nof the left hemidiaphragm. The patient gradually developed \na hernia through which bowel could enter, producing the \n\u201chump\u201d on the diaphragm seen on the chest radiograph.\nBecause this injury occurred many years ago and the patient \nhas been asymptomatic, it is unlikely that the patient will \ncome to any harm and was discharged.Clinical cases"

The physician examined her and noted that compared to \nprevious visits she had lost significant weight. She was also \njaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant ( Fig. 4.185).\nThe clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.\nIt is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can \nbe made clinically when only three clinical signs have been \ndescribed.\nThe patient\u2019s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive \nbreakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include \nobstruction along the length of the biliary tree.\nThe patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was \npalpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.\nIn healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An \nexpanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the \ncystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).\nThe patient\u2019s vomiting was related to the position of the \ntumor.\nIt is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) \nto occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, \nprimarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. \nAny tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient\u2019s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion \nwith the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively \nundigested food soon after each meal.\nA CT scan demonstrated further complications.In the region of the head and neck of the pancreas are \ncomplex anatomical structures, which may be involved with \na malignant process. The CT scan confirmed a mass in the region of the head of the pancreas, which invaded the descending part of the duodenum. The mass extended into \nthe neck of the pancreas and had blocked the distal part of \nthe bile duct and the pancreatic duct. Posteriorly the mass had directly invaded the portal venous confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, producing a series of gastric, splenic, and small bowel varices.\nThis patient underwent palliative chemotherapy, but died 7 \nmonths later.\nFig. 4.185  T umor in the head of the pancreas.

The malignant potential is dependent upon its cellular \nconfiguration and also the depth of its penetration through \nthe skin.\nThe patient developed malignant melanoma in the foot, \nwhich spread to the lymph nodes of the groin.

A diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver was made, and further confirmatory tests \ndemonstrated that the patient had significant ascites (free \nfluid within the peritoneal cavity). A liver biopsy was necessary to confirm the cirrhosis, but there was some debate about how this biopsy should be obtained  \n(eFig. 4.187).\nIn patients with cirrhosis it is important to determine the \nextent of the cirrhosis and the etiology.\nHistory, examination, and blood tests are useful and are \nsupported by complex radiological investigations. T o begin \ntreatment and determine the prognosis, a sample of liver \ntissue must be obtained. However, there are important issues to consider when taking a liver biopsy from a patient with suspected cirrhosis.\nOne issue is liver function.The liver function of patients with suspected liver disease is \npoor, as demonstrated by the patient\u2019s jaundice\u2014an inability to conjugate bilirubin. Importantly, because some liver products are blood-clotting factors involved in the \nclotting cascade, the blood-clotting ability of patients with \nsevere liver disease is significantly impaired. These patients therefore have a high risk of bleeding.\nAnother issue is the presence of ascites.\nNormally the liver rests against the lateral and anterior \nabdominal walls. This direct contact can be useful for  \ncare after a liver biopsy has been obtained. After the procedure, the patient lies over the region where the biopsy \nhas been obtained and the weight of the liver stems any \nlocalized bleeding. When patients have significant ascites, the liver cannot be compressed against the walls of the abdomen and blood may pour freely into the ascitic fluid.\nThe patient has ascites, so another approach for a liver \nbiopsy must be considered.\nThe patient was referred to the radiology department for a \ntransjugular liver biopsy.\nThe skin around the jugular vein in the neck was \nanesthetized. Access was obtained through insertion of a needle and a guidewire. The guidewire was advanced through the right internal jugular vein and into the right brachiocephalic vein. It entered the superior vena cava, was \npassed along the posterior wall of the atrium, and entered \nthe superior aspect of the inferior vena cava. A catheter was inserted over the wire and directed into the right hepatic vein. Using a series of dilators, the hole was enlarged and a biopsy needle was placed over the wire and into the right \nhepatic vein. The liver was biopsied through the right \nhepatic vein and the biopsy sample was removed. A simple suture was used to close the internal jugular vein in the neck, and minor compression stemmed any blood flow.\nAssuming that the biopsy needle does not penetrate the \nliver capsule, it is not important how much the patient bleeds from the liver, because this bleeding will enter  \nthe hepatic vein and is immediately returned to the circulation.\neFig. 4.187  T ransjugular liver biopsy needle in the right hepatic \nvein.

Further examination revealed \nasymmetrical scrotal enlargement.\nAs part of her differential diagnosis, the resident considered \nthe possibility that the man had testicular cancer with \nregional abdominal para-aortic nodal involvement (the lateral \naortic, or lumbar, nodes).\nA primary testicular neoplasm is the most common tumor in \nmen between the ages of 25 and 34 and accounts for \nbetween 1% and 2% of all malignancies in men. A family \nhistory of testicular cancer and maldescent of the testis are \nstrong predisposing factors.\nSpread of the tumor is typically to the lymph node chains \nthat drain the testes.\nThe testes develop from structures adjacent to the renal \nvessels in the upper abdomen, between the transversalis \nfascia and the peritoneum. They normally migrate through \nthe inguinal canals into the scrotum just before birth. The \ntestes take with them their arterial supply, their venous \ndrainage, their nerve supply, and their lymphatics.\nA computed tomography scan revealed a para-aortic lymph \nnode mass in the upper abdomen and enlarged lymph \nnodes throughout the internal and common iliac lymph \nnode chains.\nAssuming the scrotal mass was a carcinoma of the testes, \nwhich would normally drain into the lateral aortic (lumbar) \nnodes in the upper abdomen, it would be very unusual for \niliac lymphadenopathy to be present.\nFurther examination of the scrotal mass was required.\nA transillumination test of the scrotum on the affected side \nwas positive. An ultrasound scan revealed normal right and \nleft testes and a large fluid collection around the right testis. \nA diagnosis of a right-sided hydrocele was made.Scrotal masses are common in young males, and \ndetermining the exact anatomical site of the scrotal mass is \nof utmost clinical importance. Any mass that arises from the \ntestis should be investigated to exclude testicular cancer. \nMasses that arise from the epididymis and scrotal lesions, \nsuch as fluid (hydrocele) or hernias, are also clinically \nimportant but are not malignant.\nThe ultrasound scan revealed fluid surrounding the testis, \nwhich is diagnostic of a hydrocele. Simple cysts arising from \nand around the epididymis (epididymal cysts) can be easily \ndefined.\nA diagnosis of lymphoma was suspected.\nLymphoma is a malignant disease of lymph nodes. Most \nlymphomas are divided into two specific types, namely \nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. If \ncaught early the prognosis following radical chemotherapy is \nexcellent.\nThe patient underwent a biopsy, which was performed from \nthe posterior approach. He was placed in the prone position \nin the computed tomography (CT) scanner. A fine needle with \na special cutting device was used to obtain a lymph node \nsample. A left-sided approach was used because the inferior \nvena cava is on the right side and the nodes were in the \npara-aortic regions (i.e., the biopsy needle would have to pass \nbetween the inferior vena cava and the aorta from a posterior \napproach, which is difficult). The skin was anesthetized \nusing local anesthetic at the lateral border of the quadratus \nlumborum muscle. The needle was angled at approximately \n45\u00b0 within the quadratus lumborum muscle and entered \nthe retroperitoneum to lie beside the left-sided para-aortic \nlymph nodes. Because this procedure is performed using CT \nguidance, the operator can advance the needle slowly, taking \ncare not to \u201chit\u201d other retroperitoneal structures.\nA good biopsy was obtained and the diagnosis was \nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.

The diagnosis was a right \nindirect inguinal hernia.\nWhat were the examination findings?\nThe mass was not tender and the physician was not able to \n\u201cget above it.\u201d The testes were felt separate from the mass, \nand a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed \nbehind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the \nfront) was negative. (A positive test occurs when the light \npenetrates through the scrotum.)\nWhen the patient stood up, a positive cough \u201cimpulse\u201d was \nfelt within the mass.After careful and delicate maneuvering, the mass could be \nmassaged into the inguinal canal, so emptying from the \nscrotum. When the massaging hand was removed, the mass \nrecurred in the scrotum.\nAn indirect inguinal hernia enters the inguinal canal through \nthe deep inguinal ring. It passes through the inguinal canal \nto exit through the superficial inguinal ring in the \naponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The hernia sac \nlies superior and medial to the pubic tubercle and enters into \nthe scrotum within the spermatic cord.\nA direct inguinal hernia passes directly through the posterior \nwall of the inguinal canal. It does not pass down the inguinal \ncanal. If large enough, it may pass through the superficial \ninguinal ring and into the scrotum.\nCase 8\nURETERIC STONE\nA 25-year-old man developed severe pain in the left lower \nquadrant of his abdomen. The pain was diffuse and \nrelatively constant but did ease for short periods of time. \nOn direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain \nwas in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his \nleft infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive \nfor blood (hematuria).\nA diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made.\nThe patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated  \nto the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone \nalong the ureter.\nThe origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention.\nA series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine \nalong the length of the ureter from the kidney to the \nbladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the \nureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of \nthe pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the \ndistention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods \nof relief.\nThe pain is referred.\nThe visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter \npass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second \nlumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to \ncutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves \nfrom the same spinal cord levels.The patient was investigated by a CT scan.\nTraditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the \nradiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and \nthis often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine \nprecise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of \nthe collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones \nand pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation \ndose and no intravenous contrast.\nAn ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for \npelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the \npelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. \nUltrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of \nobstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices \nin the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women \nwhen imaging with the use of radiation is a concern.\nUsually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to \nenable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise \nlocation of the stone.\nNot infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also \nobtained. These scans not only give information about the \nkidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of \nthe stone and other associated pathology.\nIf this patient\u2019s infrascapular pain was on the right and \npredominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis \nwould also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable \ndifferentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic."

Typically, the observation chart revealed a \u201cswinging\u201d \npyrexia (fever).\nThe most common sites for abscess to develop are the \npelvis and the hepatorenal recess.\nWhen a patient is in the supine position, the lowest points in \nthe abdominal and pelvic cavities are the posterior superior \naspect of the peritoneal cavity (the hepatorenal recess) and, in women, the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas).\nThe shoulder pain suggested that the abscess was in the \nhepatorenal recess and that the pain was referred from the \ndiaphragm.\nThe motor and sensory innervation of the diaphragm is from \nnerves C3 to C5. The somatic pain sensation from the \nparietal peritoneum covering the undersurface of the \ndiaphragm is carried into the spinal cord by the phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) and is interpreted by the brain as coming from skin over the shoulder\u2014a region supplied by other somatic sensory nerves entering the same levels of the \nspinal cord as those from the diaphragm.\nA chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the right \nhemidiaphragm.\nThis elevation of the right hemidiaphragm was due to the \npus tracking from the hepatorenal space around the lateral and anterior aspect of the liver to sit on top of the liver in a \nsubphrenic position. An ultrasound scan demonstrated this collection of fluid. The abscess cavity could be clearly seen \nby placing the ultrasound probe between ribs XI and XII. The \ninferior border of the right lower lobe lies at rib X in the midaxillary line. When the probe is placed between ribs XI and XII the ultrasound waves pass between the intercostal muscles and the parietal pleura laterally on the chest wall, \nand continue through the parietal pleura overlying the \ndiaphragm into the cavity of the abscess, which lies below the diaphragm.\nDrainage was not done by an intercostal route. Instead, using \nCT guidance and local anesthesia, a subcostal drain was \nestablished and 1 liter of pus was removed (eFig. 4.188). It is important to bear in mind that placing a drain through the pleural cavity into the abdominal cavity effectively allows intraabdominal pus to pass into the thoracic cavity, and that \nthis may produce an empyema (pus in the pleural space).\nThe patient made a slow and uneventful recovery.\neFig. 4.188  Subphr enic collection of pus and gas.

He underwent an abdominoperineal resection of the tumor and was left with \na left lower abdominal colostomy (see below). \nUnfortunately, the man\u2019s wife left him for a number of reasons, including lack of sexual desire. He \u201cturned to drink\u201d and over the ensuing years developed cirrhosis. He was brought into the emergency room with severe bleeding \nfrom enlarged veins around his colostomy. An emergency \ntransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was created, which stopped all bleeding ( eFigs. 4.189 and 4.190). He is \nnow doing well in a rehabilitation program.\nA colostomy was necessary because of the low site of the \ntumor.\nCarcinoma of the colon and rectum usually develops in older \npatients, but some people do get tumors early in life. Most \ntumors develop from benign polyps, which undergo \nmalignant change. As the malignancy develops it invades through the wall of the bowel and then metastasizes to local lymphatics. The tumor extends within the wall for a few centimeters above and below its origin. Lymphatic spread is \nto local and regional lymph nodes and then to the pre-aortic lymph node chain. These drain eventually into the thoracic \nduct.\nWhen this man was assessed for surgery, the tumor was so \nclose to the anal margin that resection of the sphincters was necessary to be certain that the tumor margins were clear. The bowel cannot be joined to the anus without sphincters because the patient would be fecally incontinent. At surgery \nthe tumor was excised, including the locoregional lymph \nnode chains and the peritumoral fat around the rectum.\nThe free end of the sigmoid colon was brought through a \nhole in the anterior abdominal wall. The bowel was then \ncarefully sutured to the anterior abdominal wall to allow \nplacement of a bag to collect the feces. This is a colostomy.\nContrary to their usual immediate negative reaction to \nhaving a bag on the anterior abdominal wall, most patients cope extremely well, especially if they have been cured of \ncancer.\nThis patient\u2019s pelvic nerves were damaged. The radical \npelvic surgical dissection damaged the pelvic parasympathetic nerve supply necessary for erection of the \npenis. Unfortunately, this was not well explained to the \npatient, which in some part led to the failure of his \neFig. 4.189  P osition of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic \nshunt stent.

With any radical surgery in the pelvis, the \nnerves that supply the penis or clitoris may be damaged, so \ninterfering with sexual function.\nThis patient was bleeding from stomal varices.\nAs he developed a serious drinking problem, his liver \nbecame cirrhotic and this damaged the normal liver \narchitecture. This in turn increased the blood pressure  \nin the portal vein ( portal hypertension ).\nIn patients with portal hypertension small anastomoses \ndevelop between the veins of the portal system and the \nveins of the systemic circulation. These portosystemic \nanastomoses are usually of little consequence; however, at \nthe gastroesophageal junction, they lie in a submucosal and \nmucosal position and are subject to trauma. T orrential \nhemorrhage may occur from even minor trauma, and death \nmay ensue following blood loss. These varices require \nurgent treatment, which includes injecting sclerosant \nsubstances, banding, and even surgical ligation.\nFortunately, most of the other portosystemic anastomoses \nare of relatively little consequence. In patients with \ncolostomies, small veins may develop between the veins of \nthe large bowel (portal system drainage) and cutaneous \nveins on the anterior abdominal wall (systemic veins). If \nthese veins become enlarged because of portal \nhypertension, they are subject to trauma as feces are passed \nthrough the colostomy. T orrential hemorrhage may ensue if \nthey are damaged.A procedure was carried out to lower the portal pressure.\nT o reduce the pressure in the portal vein in this patient, \nseveral surgical procedures were considered. These included \nsewing the side of the portal vein onto the inferior vena \ncava ( portacaval shunt ) and sewing the splenic vein onto the \nrenal vein (a splenorenal shunt ). These procedures, however, \nrequire a large abdominal incision and are extremely \ncomplex. As an alternative, it was decided to create a \ntransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.\nCreating a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt  is a \nrelatively new technique that may be carried out under local \nanesthesia. Using a right internal jugular approach, a long \nneedle is placed through the internal jugular vein, the \nsuperior vena cava, and the right atrium, into the inferior \nvena cava. The right hepatic vein is cannulated and, with \nspecial steering wires, a needle is passed through the \nhepatic substance directly into the right branch of the portal \nvein. A small balloon is passed over the wire and through \nthe hepatic substance and is inflated. After the balloon has \nbeen removed, a metallic stent (a flexible wire tube) is \nplaced across this tract in the liver to keep it open. Blood \nnow freely flows from the portal vein into the right hepatic \nvein, creating a portosystemic shunt.\nAs a result of this procedure, the pressure in this patient\u2019s \nportal system is lower and similar to that of the systemic \nvenous system, so reducing the potential for bleeding at the \nportosystemic anastomoses (i.e., the colostomy).\nCase 11\nCAVAL OBSTRUCTION\nA 62-year-old man came to the emergency department with \nswelling of both legs and a large left varicocele (enlarged \nand engorged varicose veins around the left testis and \nwithin the left pampiniform plexus of veins).\nThe patient was known to have a left renal cell carcinoma \nand was due to have this operated on the following week.\nAnatomically it is possible to link all of the findings with the \nrenal cell carcinoma by knowing the biology of the tumor.\nRenal cell carcinoma tends to grow steadily and predictably. \nTypically, when the tumor is less than 3 to 4 cm, it remains \nconfined to the kidney. Large tumors have the propensity to \ngrow into the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and the right \natrium and through the heart into the pulmonary artery.\nThe tumor grew into the renal vein.\nAs the tumor grew into the renal vein it blocked off all \ntributaries draining into the vein, the largest of which is the left testicular vein. This blockage of the left testicular vein \ncaused a dilation of the veins around the left testis  \n(a varicocele occurred).\nThe swollen legs were accounted for by caval obstruction.\nThe tumor grew along the renal vein and into the inferior \nvena cava toward the heart. Renal tumors can grow rapidly; \nin this case the tumor grew rapidly into the inferior vena \ncava, occluding it. This increased the pressure in the leg \nveins, resulting in swelling and pitting edema of the ankles.\nThe patient unfortunately died on the operating table.\nIn this patient\u2019s case, a \u201ctongue\u201d of tumor grew into the \ninferior vena cava. At the time of surgery, the initial \ndissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; \nhowever, a large portion of tumor became detached in the \ninferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the \nright atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary \nartery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and \nthe patient succumbed."

He had pain radiating \ninto the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas \nand fecal debris as he urinated.\nA CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed  \n(eFig. 4.191).\nThe CT scan demonstrated a collection of fluid (likely a \npelvic abscess) in the left iliac fossa. Associated with this collection of fluid was significant bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and multiple small diverticula arising \nthroughout the sigmoid colon. Gas was present in the \nbladder. An obstruction was noted in the left ureter and the \nleft pelvicalyceal system.\nThe patient underwent an urgent operation.\nAs the surgeons entered into the abdominal cavity through a \nmidline incision, the tissues in the left iliac fossa were \neFig. 4.191  A c omputed tomogram, in the axial plane, of the \npelvis demonstrates a loop of sigmoid colon with numerous \ndiverticula and a large abscess in the pelvic cavity. \nSigmoid colon diverticuli\nSigmoid colonPelvic abscesssignificantly inflamed.

The sigmoid colon \nwas remarkably thickened and inflamed and stuck to the \ndome of the bladder. Careful finger dissection revealed a small perforation in the dome of the bladder, allowing the passage of fecal material and gas into the bladder and producing the patient\u2019s symptoms of pneumaturia and \nfecaluria. The sigmoid colon was resected. The rectal stump \nwas oversewn and the descending colon was passed through the anterior abdominal wall to form a colostomy.

A \nsignificant amount of pus was drained from the renal tract initially; however, after 24 hours urine passed freely.\nThe likely cause for the obstruction was the inflammation \naround the distal ureter on the left. It is also possible that a \nsmall ureteric perforation occurred, allowing bacteria to enter \nthe urinary tract.\nThe patient made a further uneventful recovery with \nresumption of normal renal function and left the hospital.\nOn return to the surgeon in the outpatient clinic some \nweeks later, the patient did not wish to continue with his colostomy and bag. Further to discussion, surgery was planned to \u201crejoin\u201d the patient.\nAt operation the colostomy was \u201ctaken down\u201d and the rectal \nstump was identified. There was, however, a significant gap between the bowel ends. T o enable the bowel to be sutured, the descending colon was mobilized from the \nposterior abdominal wall.

The \naneurysm measured 10 cm, and after discussion with the \npatient it was scheduled for repair.\nThe surgical and endovascular treatment options were \nexplained to the patient.\nTreatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been, for \nmany years, an operative procedure where the dilation \n(ballooning) of the aorta is resected and a graft is sewn into \nposition. A modern option is to place a graft to line the \naneurysm from within the artery (endovascular aneurysm \nrepair). In this technique the surgeon dissects the femoral \nartery and makes a small hole in it. The graft is compressed \nwithin a catheter and the catheter is passed through the \nfemoral artery and the iliac arterial system into the distal \nabdominal aorta. The graft can then be released inside the \naorta, effectively relining it to prevent further expansion of \nthe aneurysm.\nOccasionally the relined aneurysm may continue to enlarge \nafter the endovascular graft has been placed and a cause \nneeds to be identified.\nA Doppler ultrasound investigation of the abdomen and a CT \nscan revealed there was flow between the endovascular \nlining and the wall of the aneurysm.The likely sources for this bleeding were assessed.\nThe graft usually begins below the level of the renal arteries \nand divides into two limbs that end in the common iliac \narteries. The aneurysm may continue to be fed from any \nvessels between the graft and the aneurysm wall. These \nvessels can include the lumbar arteries and the inferior \nmesenteric artery. Interestingly, blood usually flows from  \nthe abdominal aorta into the inferior mesenteric artery and \nthe lumbar arteries; however, with the changes in flow \ndynamics with the graft in place, blood may flow in the \nopposite direction through these branches, thereby leading \nto enlargement of the aneurysm.\nBlood flow was from the superior mesenteric artery into the \naneurysm sac.\nAbove the level of the graft the superior mesenteric artery \narises normally. From the right colic and middle colic \nbranches a marginal branch around the colon anastomoses, \nin the region of the splenic flexure, with marginal branches \nfrom the inferior mesenteric artery (this can become a \nhypertrophied vessel known as the marginal artery of \nDrummond). In this situation, blood passed retrogradely into \nthe inferior mesenteric artery, filling the aneurysm and \nallowing it to remain pressurized and expand.\nThe inferior mesenteric artery was ligated laparoscopically  \nand the aneurysm failed to expand further. Over the ensuing \n6 months the aneurysm contracted. The patient remains fit \nand healthy, with two small scars in the groin."

The deep perineal pouch is a narrow region superior to the perineal membrane.\nThe margins of  the U-shaped defect in the pelvic dia -\nphragm merge into the walls of  the associated viscera and with muscles in the deep perineal pouch below .\nThe vagina and the urethra penetrate the pelvic floor to \npass from the pelvic cavity to the perineum.\nPelvic cavity\nThe pelvic cavity is lined by peritoneum continuous with the peritoneum of  the abdominal cavity that drapes  \nover the superior aspects of  the pelvic viscera, but in most regions, does not reach the pelvic floor (Fig. 5.8A).\nThe pelvic viscera are located in the midline of  the pelvic \ncavity . The bladder is anterior and the rectum is posterior. In women, the uterus lies between the bladder and rectum (Fig. 5.8B). Other structures, such as vessels and nerves, lie deep to the peritoneum in association with the pelvic walls and on either side of  the pelvic viscera."

It has a body and two arms (rami).\n\u25a0 The body is flattened dorsoventrally and articulates \nwith the body of  the pubic bone on the other side at the pubic symphysis. The body has a rounded pubic crest on its superior surface that ends laterally as the promi -\nnent pubic tubercle.\n\u25a0 The superior pubic ramus projects posterolaterally \nfrom the body and joins with the ilium and ischium at its base, which is positioned toward the acetabulum. The sharp superior margin of  this triangular surface is termed the pecten pubis (pectineal line), which forms part of  the linea terminalis of  the pelvic bone and the pelvic inlet. Anteriorly , this line is continuous with the pubic crest, which also is part of  the linea termi -\nnalis and pelvic inlet. The superior pubic ramus is \nmarked on its inferior surface by the obturator groove, \nwhich forms the upper margin of  the obturator canal.\n\u25a0 The inf erior ramus projects laterally and inferiorly to \njoin with the ramus of  the ischium.\nIschium\nThe ischium is the posterior and inferior part of  the pelvic bone (Fig. 5.21). It has:\n\u25a0 a large body that projects superiorly to join with the \nilium and the superior ramus of  the pubis, and\n\u25a0 a r amus that projects anteriorly to join with the inferior \nramus of  the pubis.\nThe posterior margin of  the bone is marked by a promi -\nnent ischial spine that separates the lesser sciatic notch, \nbelow, from the greater sciatic notch, above.\nThe most prominent feature of  the ischium is a large \ntuberosity (the ischial tuberosity) on the posteroinferior \naspect of  the bone. This tuberosity is an important site for the attachment of  lower limb muscles and for supporting the body when sitting.\nSacrum\nThe sacrum, which has the appearance of  an inverted triangle, is formed by the fusion of  the five sacral vertebrae (Fig. 5.22). The base of  the sacrum articulates with verte -\nbra LV , and its apex articulates with the coccyx. Each of  the lateral surfaces of  the bone bears a large L-shaped facet for \narticulation with the ilium of  the pelvic bone.

The superior surface of  the sacrum is characterized by the superior The arcuate line forms part of  the linea terminalis and \nthe pelvic brim.\nThe portion of  the ilium lying inferiorly to the arcuate \nline is the pelvic part of  the ilium and contributes to the wall of  the lesser or true pelvis.\nThe upper part of  the ilium expands to form a flat, fan-\nshaped \u201cwing,\u201d which provides bony support for the lower abdomen, or false pelvis. This part of  the ilium provides attachment for muscles functionally associated with the lower limb. The anteromedial surface of  the wing is concave and forms the iliac fossa. The external (gluteal) \nsurface of  the wing is marked by lines and roughenings and is related to the gluteal region of  the lower limb  \n(Fig. 5.21B).\nThe entire superior margin of  the ilium is thickened to \nform a prominent crest (the iliac crest), which is the site of  attachment for muscles and fascia of  the abdomen, back, and lower limb and terminates anteriorly as the anterior superior iliac spine  and posteriorly as the \nposterior superior iliac spine.\nA prominent tubercle, the tuberculum of  the iliac \ncrest, projects laterally near the anterior end of  the crest; the posterior end of  the crest thickens to form the iliac \ntuberosity.\nInferior to the anterior superior iliac spine of  the crest, \non the anterior margin of  the ilium, is a rounded protuber -\nance called the anterior inferior iliac spine . This struc-\nture serves as the point of  attachment for the rectus femoris muscle of  the anterior compartment of  the thigh and the iliofemoral ligament associated with the hip joint. A less prominent posterior inferior iliac spine  occurs along \nthe posterior border of  the sacral surface of  the ilium, where the bone angles forward to form the superior margin of  the greater sciatic notch.\nIn the clinic\nBone marrow biopsy\nIn certain diseases (e.g., leukemia), a sample of bone \nmarrow must be obtained to assess the stage and severity of the problem. The iliac crest is often used for such bone \nmarrow biopsies. The iliac crest lies close to the surface \nand is easily palpated.\nA bone marrow biopsy is performed by injecting \nanesthetic in the skin and passing a cutting needle through the cortical bone of the iliac crest. The bone \nmarrow is aspirated and viewed under a microscope. \nSamples of cortical bone can also be obtained in this way to provide information about bone metabolism."

The lumbosacral joints are formed between vertebra LV and the sacrum and consist of:\n\u25a0 the tw o zygapophysial joints, which occur between \nadjacent inferior and superior articular processes, and\n\u25a0 an inter vertebral disc that joins the bodies of  vertebrae \nLV and SI (Fig. 5.23A).\nThese joints are similar to those between other verte-\nbrae, with the exception that the sacrum is angled posteri -\norly on vertebra LV . As a result, the anterior part of  the \nintervertebral disc between the two bones is thicker than the posterior part.\nThe lumbosacral joints are reinforced by strong iliolum -\nbar and lumbosacral ligaments that extend from the expanded transverse processes of  vertebra LV to the ilium and the sacrum, respectively (Fig. 5.23B).\nSacro-iliac joints\nThe sacro-iliac joints transmit forces from the lower limbs to the vertebral column. They are synovial joints between the L-shaped articular facets on the lateral surfaces of  the \nsacrum and similar facets on the iliac parts of  the pelvic bones (Fig. 5.24A). The joint surfaces have an irregular contour and interlock to resist movement. The joints often In the clinic\nPelvic fracture\nThe pelvis can be viewed as a series of anatomical rings. \nThere are three bony rings and four fibro-osseous rings. The major bony pelvic ring consists of parts of the \nsacrum, ilium, and pubis, which forms the pelvic inlet. \nTwo smaller subsidiary rings are the obturator foramina. The greater and lesser sciatic foramina formed by the greater and lesser sciatic notches and the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments form the four fibro-osseous \nrings. The rings, which are predominantly bony (i.e., the \npelvic inlet and the obturator foramina), are brittle rings. It is not possible to break one side of the ring without breaking the other side of the ring, which in clinical terms \nmeans that if a fracture is demonstrated on one side, a \nsecond fracture should always be suspected.\nFractures of the pelvis may occur in isolation; however, \nthey usually occur in trauma patients and warrant special mention.\nOwing to the large bony surfaces of the pelvis, a fracture \nproduces an area of bone that can bleed significantly. A large hematoma may be produced, which can compress organs such as the bladder and the ureters. This blood loss may occur rapidly, reducing the circulating blood volume \nand, unless this is replaced, the patient will become \nhypovolemic and shock will develop.\nPelvic fractures may also disrupt the contents of the \npelvis, leading to urethral disruption, potential bowel rupture, and nerve damage.\nFig. 5.23  L umbosacral joints and associated ligaments.

The margins \nof  this hiatus merge with the walls of  the associated viscera and with muscles in the deep perineal pouch below . The hiatus allows the urethra (in both men and women), and the vagina (in women), to pass through the pelvic dia-phragm (Fig. 5.34).\nThe levator ani muscles are divided into at least three \ncollections of  muscle fibers, based on site of  origin and relationship to viscera in the midline: the pubococcygeus, the puborectalis, and the iliococcygeus muscles.\n\u25a0 The pubococcygeus originates from the body of  the \npubis and courses posteriorly to attach along the midline as far back as the coccyx. This part of  the muscle is further subdivided on the basis of  association with structures in the midline into the puboprostaticus \n(levator prostatae), the pubovaginalis, and the puboanalis muscles.\n\u25a0 A second major collection of  muscle fibers, the \npuborectalis portion of  the levator ani muscles, originates, in association with the pubococcygeus muscle, from the pubis and passes inferiorly on each side to form a sling around the terminal part of  the gastrointestinal tract. This muscular sling maintains an angle or flexure, called the perineal flexure, at the \nanorectal junction. This angle functions as part of  the mechanism that keeps the end of  the gastrointestinal system closed.\n\u25a0 The final par t of  the levator ani muscle is the iliococ-\ncygeus. This part of  the muscle originates from the fascia that covers the obturator internus muscle. It joins the same muscle on the other side in the midline to form a ligament or raphe that extends from the anal aperture to the coccyx.\nThe levator ani muscles help support the pelvic viscera \nand maintain closure of  the rectum and vagina. They \nare innervated directly by branches from the anterior ramus of  S4 and by branches of  the pudendal nerve (S2  \nto S4).\nCoccygeus\nThe two coccygeus muscles, one on each side, are triangu -\nlar and overlie the sacrospinous ligaments; together they complete the posterior part of  the pelvic diaphragm (Fig. 5.34 and Table 5.2). They are attached, by their apices, \nto the tips of  the ischial spines and, by their bases, to the lateral margins of  the coccyx and adjacent margins of  the sacrum.\nThe coccygeus muscles are innervated by branches from \nthe anterior rami of  S3 and S4 and participate in support-ing the posterior aspect of  the pelvic floor.In the clinic\nDefecation\nAt the beginning of defecation, closure of the larynx \nstabilizes the diaphragm and intraabdominal pressure is increased by contraction of abdominal wall muscles. As \ndefecation proceeds, the puborectalis muscle surrounding \nthe anorectal junction relaxes, which straightens the anorectal angle. Both the internal and the external anal sphincters also relax to allow feces to move through the anal canal. Normally, the puborectal sling maintains an \nangle of about 90\u00b0 between the rectum and the anal canal \nand acts as a \u201cpinch valve\u201d to prevent defecation. When the puborectalis muscle relaxes, the anorectal angle increases to about 130\u00b0 to 140\u00b0.\nThe fatty tissue of the ischio-anal fossa allows for \nchanges in the position and size of the anal canal and anus during defecation. During evacuation, the anorectal junction moves down and back and the pelvic floor usually descends slightly.\nDuring defecation, the circular muscles of the rectal \nwall undergo a wave of contraction to push feces toward the anus. As feces emerge from the anus, the longitudinal muscles of the rectum and levator ani bring the anal canal back up, the feces are expelled, and the anus and rectum \nreturn to their normal positions.\nA magnetic resonance defecating proctogram is a fairly \nnew imaging technique that allows assessment of \ndifferent phases of defecation, including rectal function and behavior of the pelvic floor musculature during this \nprocess. It is useful in detecting pelvic organ abnormal \ndescent/prolapse during dynamic scanning and potential formation of cystocele or rectocele (Fig. 5.35 ).\nFig. 5.35  MRI def ecating proctogram in sagittal plane \nshowing active defecation. \nSacrum\nRectum Urinary bladder Active defecation"

Traditionally it was felt that if a perineal tear is likely, the obstetrician may proceed with an episiotomy. This is a \nprocedure in which an incision is made in the perineal \nbody to allow the head of the fetus to pass through the vagina. There are two types of episiotomies: a median episiotomy cuts through the perineal body, while a mediolateral episiotomy is an incision 45\u00b0 from the \nmidline. The maternal benefits of this procedure have \nbeen thought to be less traumatic to the perineum and to result in decreased pelvic floor dysfunction after childbirth. However, more recent evidence suggests that an \nepisiotomy should not be performed routinely. Review of \ndata has failed to show a decrease in pelvic floor damage with routine use of episiotomies.The viscera are arranged in the midline, from front to back; \nthe neurovascular supply is through branches that pass medially from vessels and nerves associated with the pelvic walls.\nGastrointestinal system\nPelvic parts of  the gastrointestinal system consist mainly of  the rectum and the anal canal, although the terminal part of  the sigmoid colon is also in the pelvic cavity (Fig. 5.39).\nRectum\nThe rectum is continuous:\n\u25a0 a bove, with the sigmoid colon at about the level of  ver -\ntebra SIII, and\n\u25a0 belo w, with the anal canal as this structure penetrates \nthe pelvic floor and passes through the perineum to end as the anus.\nThe rectum, the most posterior element of  the pelvic \nviscera, is immediately anterior to and follows the concave \ncontour of  the sacrum.\nThe anorectal junction is pulled forward (perineal \nflexure) by the action of  the puborectalis part of  the levator ani muscle, so the anal canal moves in a posterior direction as it passes inferiorly through the pelvic floor.\nIn addition to conforming to the general curvature of  \nthe sacrum in the anteroposterior plane, the rectum has three lateral curvatures; the upper and lower curvatures to the right and the middle curvature to the left. The lower part of  the rectum is expanded to form the rectal ampulla. Finally , unlike the colon, the rectum lacks distinct taeniae coli muscles, omental appendices, and sacculations (haustra of  the colon).\nAnal canal\nThe anal canal  begins at the terminal end of  the rectal \nampulla where it narrows at the pelvic floor. It terminates as the anus after passing through the perineum. As it passes through the pelvic floor, the anal canal is surrounded along its entire length by the internal and external anal sphincters, which normally keep it closed.\nThe lining of  the anal canal bears a number of  charac -\nteristic structural features that reflect the approximate position of  the anococcygeal membrane in the fetus (which closes the terminal end of  the developing gastrointestinal system in the fetus) and the transition from gastrointestinal mucosa to skin in the adult (Fig. 5.39B).\n\u25a0 The upper par t of  the anal canal is lined by mucosa \nsimilar to that lining the rectum and is distinguished by a number of  longitudinally oriented folds known as Viscera\nThe pelvic viscera include parts of  the gastrointestinal system, the urinary system, and the reproductive system."

The most common surgeries that can result in \nureteric injury are total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral \nsalpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries), laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum, and open left hemicolectomy. At increased risk of ureteric injury are \npatients with a bulky tumor (uterine, colonic, rectal) and \nthose with a history of previous operations or pelvic irradiation, all of which make dissection of tissues more difficult. During surgery, the ureter can be crushed, cut open, \ndevascularized, or avulsed. It can also be injured during \ncryoablation or electric cauterization to control intraoperative bleeding. Ureters can also undergo trauma during the course of ureteroscopy, a procedure where a small endoscope is \nintroduced through the urethra and urinary bladder into one \nof the ureters to treat stones or tumors of the ureter (usually due to a tear or electrocauterization).\nUreteric injury leads to high morbidity due to infection \nand in most severe cases to renal impairment.

Prostatic involvement is not uncommon in male patients. The disease spreads via the internal iliac lymph nodes. Spread to distant metastatic sites rarely includes the lung.\nLarge bladder tumors may produce complications, \nincluding invasion and obstruction of the ureters. Ureteric obstruction can then obstruct the kidneys and induce kidney failure. Moreover, bladder tumors can invade other structures \nof the pelvic cavity.\nTreatment for early-stage tumors includes local resection \nwith preservation of the bladder. Diffuse tumors may be \ntreated with local chemotherapy; more extensive tumors may require radical surgical removal of the bladder \n(cystectomy) and, in men, the prostate (prostatectomy). \nBladder reconstruction (formation of so-called neobladder) is performed in patients after cystectomy using part of a bowel, most commonly the ileum.\nFig. 5.44  Intra venous urogram demonstrating a small tumor in \nthe wall of the bladder. \nRenal pelvis\nBladder Small tumorIn the clinic\nSuprapubic catheterization\nIn certain instances it is necessary to catheterize the bladder through the anterior abdominal wall.

            "Text": "Regional Anatomy  \u2022  Pelvis\n 5\n463Reproductive system\nIn men\nThe reproductive system in men has components in the \nabdomen, pelvis, and perineum (Fig. 5.47A). The major components are a testis, epididymis, ductus deferens, and ejaculatory duct on each side, and the urethra and penis in the midline. In addition, three types of  accessory glands are associated with the system:\n\u25a0 a sing le prostate,\n\u25a0 a pair of  seminal vesicles, and\n\u25a0 a pair of  bulbo-urethral glands.\nThe design of  the reproductive system in men is basi -\ncally a series of  ducts and tubules. The arrangement of  parts and linkage to the urinary tract reflects its embryo -\nlogical development.\nT estes\nThe testes originally develop high on the posterior \nabdominal wall and then descend, normally before birth, through the inguinal canal in the anterior abdominal wall and into the scrotum of  the perineum. During descent, the testes carry their vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, as well as their principal drainage ducts, the ductus deferens (vas \ndeferens) with them. The lymph drainage of  the testes is therefore to the lateral aortic or lumbar nodes and pre-aortic nodes in the abdomen, and not to the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.\nEach ellipsoid-shaped testis is enclosed within the end of  \nan elongated musculofascial pouch, which is continuous with the anterior abdominal wall and projects into the scrotum. The spermatic cord is the tube-shaped connec-\ntion between the pouch in the scrotum and the abdominal wall.\nThe sides and anterior aspect of  the testis are covered by \na closed sac of  peritoneum (the tunica vaginalis), which \noriginally connected to the abdominal cavity . Normally after testicular descent, the connection closes, leaving a fibrous remnant.\nEach testis (Fig. 5.47B) is composed of  seminiferous \ntubules and interstitial tissue surrounded by a thick con -\nnective tissue capsule (the tunica albuginea). Spermato-\nzoa are produced by the seminiferous tubules. The 400 to 600 highly coiled seminiferous tubules are modified at each end to become straight tubules, which connect to a collecting chamber (the rete testis) in a thick, vertically \noriented linear wedge of  connective tissue (the media-\nstinum testis), projecting from the capsule into the pos -\nterior aspect of  the gonad. Approximately 12 to 20 efferent \nductules originate from the upper end of  the rete testis, penetrate the capsule, and connect with the epididymis.In the clinic\nTesticular tumors\nTumors of the testis account for a small percentage of \nmalignancies in men. However, they generally occur in younger patients (between 20 and 40 years of age). When \ndiagnosed at an early stage, most of these tumors are \ncurable by surgery and chemotherapy.\nEarly diagnosis of testicular tumors is extremely \nimportant. Abnormal lumps can be detected by palpation, and diagnosis can be made using ultrasound. Simple \nultrasound scanning can reveal the extent of the local \ntumor, usually at an early stage.\nSurgical removal of the malignant testis is often carried \nout using an inguinal approach. The testis is not usually \nremoved through a scrotal incision, because it is possible \nto spread tumor cells into the subcutaneous tissues of the scrotum, which has a different lymphatic drainage than the testis.\nIn the clinic\nEctopic testes\nInterrupted descent of testis leads to an empty scrotal sac and abnormal location of the testis, which can lie anywhere along the usual route of descent. Most \ncommonly the testis is present in the inguinal canal, \nwhere it can be palpated. This condition is usually diagnosed at birth or within the first year of life. A higher incidence of ectopic (undescended) testis occurs in premature births (30%) than in term births (3\u20135%). \nNormally, the ectopic testis can complete its descent \nwithin the first 3 months after a child is born; therefore watchful waiting is recommended for the first couple of months. A specialist referral is usually made at 6 months if \nthe testis is still absent from the scrotal sac. It is crucial to \nmake the diagnosis early so that an appropriate management plan can be initiated to avoid or reduce the risk of complications such as testicular malignancy, subfertility or infertility, testicular torsion, and inguinal \nhernia (due to patent processus vaginalis). If surgical \ncorrection is required, the ectopic testis is moved from the inguinal canal into the scrotum (orchiopexy). During mobilization of the testis, dissection of tissues must be performed carefully to avoid injuring the ilioinguinal nerve \nadjacent to the spermatic cord. At the time of orchiopexy, \nthe patent processus vaginalis is closed and any inguinal hernia, if present, is repaired."

The end of  \nthe epididymis is continuous with the ductus deferens.\nDuctus deferens\nThe ductus deferens is a long muscular duct that transports spermatozoa from the tail of  the epididymis in  \nthe scrotum to the ejaculatory duct in the pelvic cavity (Fig. 5.47A). It ascends in the scrotum as a component of  the spermatic cord and passes through the inguinal canal in the anterior abdominal wall.\nAfter passing through the deep inguinal ring, the ductus \ndeferens bends medially around the lateral side of  the inferior epigastric artery and crosses the external iliac artery and the external iliac vein at the pelvic inlet to enter the pelvic cavity .\nThe duct descends medially on the pelvic wall, deep to \nthe peritoneum, and crosses the ureter posterior to the bladder. It continues inferomedially along the base of  the bladder, anterior to the rectum, almost to the midline, where it is joined by the duct of  the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct.\nBetween the ureter and ejaculatory duct, the ductus \ndeferens expands to form the ampulla of  the ductus defer -\nens.

Because it has a thick smooth muscle \nwall, it can be easily palpated in the spermatic cord \nbetween the testes and the superficial inguinal ring. Also, because it can be accessed through skin and superficial fascia, it is amenable to surgical dissection and surgical division.

The inferolateral surfaces of  the prostate are in contact with the levator ani muscles that together cradle the prostate between them.\nThe prostate develops as 30 to 40 individual complex \nglands, which grow from the urethral epithelium into the surrounding wall of  the urethra. Collectively , these glands enlarge the wall of  the urethra into what is known as the prostate; however, the individual glands retain their own ducts, which empty independently into the prostatic sinuses on the posterior aspect of  the urethral lumen (see Fig. 5.45C).\nSecretions from the prostate, together with secretions \nfrom the seminal vesicles, contribute to the formation of  semen during ejaculation.\nThe ejaculatory ducts pass almost vertically in an \nanteroinferior direction through the posterior aspect of  the prostate to open into the prostatic urethra.\nBulbo-urethral glands\nThe bulbo-urethral glands (see Fig. 5.47A), one on \neach side, are small, pea-shaped mucous glands situated within the deep perineal pouch.

Prostate cancer typically occurs in the \nperipheral zone of the prostate (see Fig. 5.48) and is \nrelatively asymptomatic. In many cases, it is diagnosed by a digital rectal examination (DRE) (Fig. 5.49A) and by blood tests, which include serum acid phosphatase and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In rectal exams, the \ntumorous prostate feels \u201crock\u201d hard. The diagnosis is usually \nmade by obtaining a number of biopsies of the prostate. Ultrasound is used during the biopsy procedure to image the prostate for the purpose of taking measurements and for \nneedle placement. Ultrasound can also be used to aid \nplanning radiotherapy by placing special metal markers, called fiducials, under direct ultrasound guidance, through the rectal wall into or near the tumor. This allows maximization of the radiation dose to the tumor while protecting healthy tissue.\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy is a disease of the prostate \nthat occurs with increasing age in most men (Fig. 5.49B). It generally involves the more central regions of the prostate (see Fig. 5.48), which gradually enlarge. The prostate feels \u201cbulky\u201d on DRE. Owing to the more central hypertrophic \nchange of the prostate, the urethra is compressed, and a \nurinary outflow obstruction develops in a number of patients. With time, the bladder may become hypertrophied in response to the urinary outflow obstruction. In some male patients, the obstruction becomes so severe that urine \ncannot be passed and transurethral or suprapubic \ncatheterization is necessary.

This technique also allows obstetricians and technicians to view a fetus and record its growth throughout pregnancy.\nSome patients are not suitable for transabdominal \nscanning, in which case a probe may be passed into the vagina, permitting close visualization of the uterus, the contents of the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas), \nand the ovaries. The ovaries can also be visualized \nlaparoscopically. Many countries have introduced screening programs for cervical cancer where women are regularly called for smear tests.In the clinic\nOvarian cancer\nOvarian cancer remains one of the major challenges in oncology. The ovaries contain numerous cell types, all of which can undergo malignant change and require different \nimaging and treatment protocols and ultimately have \ndifferent prognoses.\nOvarian tumors most commonly originate from the \novarian surface (germinal) epithelium that is continuous at a sharp transition zone with the peritoneum of the \nmesovarium.\nMany factors have been linked with the development of \novarian tumors, including a strong family history.\nOvarian cancer may occur at any age, but more typically \nit occurs in older women.\nCancer of the ovaries may spread via the blood and \nlymphatics, and frequently metastasizes directly into the \nperitoneal cavity. Such direct peritoneal cavity spread allows the passage of tumor cells along the paracolic gutters and \nover the liver from where this disease may disseminate \neasily. Unfortunately, many patients already have metastatic and diffuse disease (Fig. 5.52) at the time of diagnosis.Fig. 5.52  S agittal magnetic resonance image demonstrating \novarian cancer. \nSacrum\nUterus\nRectum\nCervixTumor\nBladder\nPubic\nsymphysis\nFig. 5.53  Ut erus.

During pregnancy , the uterus dramati -\ncally expands superiorly into the abdominal cavity .\nIn the clinic\nHysterectomy\nA hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. This \nis usually complete excision of the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus, though occasionally the cervix may \nbe left in situ. In some instances the uterine (fallopian) \ntubes and ovaries are removed as well. This procedure is called a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\nHysterectomy, oophorectomy, and \nsalpingo-oophorectomy may be performed in patients who have reproductive malignancy, such as uterine, cervical, and ovarian cancers. Other indications include a strong family history of reproductive disorders, \nendometriosis, and excessive bleeding. Occasionally the \nuterus may need to be removed postpartum because of excessive postpartum bleeding.\nA hysterectomy is performed through a transverse \nsuprapubic incision (Pfannenstiel\u2019s incision). During the \nprocedure tremendous care is taken to identify the distal \nureters and to ligate the nearby uterine arteries without damage to the ureters.\nFig. 5.54  Ut erine tubes. \nAmpulla\nIsthmusOvary\nAnterior Posterior\nMedialLateral\nFundus of uterusInfundibulum\nFimbriaeOpening of the\nuterine tube\nRound ligament\nof uterusLigament of ovaryUterine tubes\nThe uterine tubes extend from each side of  the superior \nend of  the body of  the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall and \nare enclosed within the upper margins of  the mesosalpinx portions of  the broad ligaments (see p. 477). Because the ovaries are suspended from the posterior aspect of  the broad ligaments, the uterine tubes pass superiorly over, and terminate laterally to, the ovaries.\nEach uterine tube has an expanded trumpet-shaped end \n(the infundibulum), which curves around the superolat -\neral pole of  the related ovary (Fig. 5.54). The margin of  the infundibulum is rimmed with small finger-like projections termed fimbriae. The lumen of  the uterine tube opens into \nthe peritoneal cavity at the narrowed end of  the infundibu-lum. Medial to the infundibulum, the tube expands to form the ampulla and then narrows to form the isthmus, \nbefore joining with the body of  the uterus.\nThe fimbriated infundibulum facilitates the collection of  \novulated eggs from the ovary .

The body of  the uterus normally arches forward (anteflexed on the cervix) over the superior surface of  the emptied bladder (Fig. 5.55A). In addition, the cervix is angled forward (anteverted) on the vagina so that the inferior end of  the cervix projects into the upper anterior aspect of  the vagina. Because the end of  the cervix is dome shaped, it bulges into the vagina, and a gutter, or fornix, is formed around the margin of  the cervix where it joins the vaginal wall (Fig. 5.55B).

Pelvic parts of  the plexus are associated with innervating pelvic viscera and erectile tissues of  the perineum.\nThe prevertebral plexus enters the pelvis as two hypo-\ngastric nerves, one on each side, that cross the pelvic inlet medially to the internal iliac vessels (Fig. 5.63A). The hypogastric nerves are formed by the separation of  the fibers in the superior hypogastric plexus , into right and \nleft bundles. The superior hypogastric plexus is situated anterior to vertebra LV between the promontory of  the sacrum and the bifurcation of  the aorta.\nWhen the hypogastric nerves are joined by pelvic \nsplanchnic nerves carrying preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from S2 to S4, the pelvic plexuses (inferior hypo-gastric plexuses) are formed (Fig. 5.63). The inferior hypogastric plexuses, one on each side, course in an inferior direction around the pelvic walls, medially to major vessels and somatic nerves. They give origin to the following sub -\nsidiary plexuses, which innervate the pelvic viscera:\n\u25a0 the rectal plexus,\n\u25a0 the uterovaginal plexus,\n\u25a0 the prostatic plexus, and\n\u25a0 the vesical plexus.\nTerminal branches of  the inferior hypogastric plexuses \npenetrate and pass through the deep perineal pouch and innervate erectile tissues of  the penis and the clitoris in the perineum (Fig. 5.63B). In men, these nerves, called cav-\nernous nerves, are extensions of  the prostatic plexus. The pattern of  distribution of  similar nerves in women is not entirely clear, but they are likely extensions of  the utero -\nvaginal plexus.\nSympathetic fibers\nSympathetic fibers enter the inferior hypogastric plex-uses from the hypogastric nerves and from branches (sacral splanchnic nerves) of  the upper sacral parts of  the sympathetic trunks (Fig. 5.63A). Ultimately , these nerves are derived from preganglionic fibers that leave the spinal cord in the anterior roots, mainly of  T10 to L2.  \nThese fibers:\u25a0 inner vate blood vessels,\n\u25a0 cause contr action of  smooth muscle in the internal \nurethral sphincter in men and the internal anal sphinc -\nters in both men and women,\n\u25a0 cause smooth muscle contraction associated with the \nreproductive tract and with the accessory glands of  the reproductive system, and\n\u25a0 are impor tant in moving secretions from the epididymis \nand associated glands into the urethra to form semen during ejaculation.\nParasympathetic fibers\nParasympathetic fibers enter the pelvic plexus in pelvic splanchnic nerves that originate from spinal cord levels S2 to S4 (Fig. 5.63A). They:\n\u25a0 are g enerally vasodilatory ,\n\u25a0 stim ulate bladder contraction,\n\u25a0 stim ulate erection, and\n\u25a0 modula te activity of  the enteric nervous system of  the \ncolon distal to the left colic flexure (in addition to pelvic viscera, some of  the fibers from the pelvic plexus course superiorly in the prevertebral plexus, or as separate nerves, and pass into the inferior mesenteric plexus of  the abdomen).\nVisceral afferent fibers\nVisceral afferent fibers follow the course of  the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers to the spinal cord. Afferent fibers that enter the cord in lower thoracic levels and lumbar levels with sympathetic fibers generally carry pain; however, pain fibers from the cervix and some pain fibers from the bladder and urethra may accompany parasympa -\nthetic nerves to sacral levels of  the spinal cord.\nIn the clinic\nProstatectomy and impotence\nIt may be necessary to perform radical surgery to cure \ncancer of the prostate. T o do this, the prostate and its attachments around the base of the bladder, including the \nseminal vesicles, must be removed en masse. Parts of the \ninferior hypogastric plexus in this region give rise to nerves that innervate the erectile tissues of the penis. Impotence may occur if these nerves cannot be or are not preserved during removal of the prostate.\nFor the same reasons, women may experience sexual \ndysfunction if similar nerves are damaged during pelvic surgery, for example, during a total hysterectomy."

Anteriorly , the vessel leaves the pelvic cavity and ascends on the internal aspect of  the anterior abdominal wall to reach the umbilicus. In the fetus, the umbilical artery is large and carries blood from the  \nfetus to the placenta. After birth, the vessel closes distally to the origin of  the superior vesical artery and eventu -\nally becomes a solid fibrous cord. On the anterior abdominal wall, the cord raises a fold of  peritoneum termed the medial umbilical fold. The fibrous remnant of  the umbilical artery itself  is the medial umbilical \nligament.\n\u25a0 The superior vesical artery  normally originates from \nthe root of  the umbilical artery and courses medially and inferiorly to supply the superior aspect of  the bladder and distal parts of  the ureter. In men, it also may give rise to an artery that supplies the ductus  \ndeferens.\n\u25a0 The inferior vesical artery occurs in men and supplies \nbranches to the bladder, ureter, seminal vesicle, and prostate. The vaginal artery in women is the equivalent \nof  the inferior vesical artery in men and, descending to the vagina, supplies branches to the vagina and to adjacent parts of  the bladder and rectum. The vaginal artery and uterine artery may originate together as a common branch from the anterior trunk, or the vaginal artery may arise independently .\n\u25a0 The middle rectal artery courses medially to supply \nthe rectum. The vessel anastomoses with the superior rectal artery , which originates from the inferior mesen -\nteric artery in the abdomen, and the inferior rectal artery , which originates from the internal pudendal artery in the perineum.\n\u25a0 The obturator artery courses anteriorly along the \npelvic wall and leaves the pelvic cavity via the obturator canal. Together with the obturator nerve, above, and Internal iliac artery\nThe internal iliac artery originates from the common iliac artery on each side, approximately at the level of  the intervertebral disc between LV and SI, and lies anterome-dial to the sacro-iliac joint (Fig. 5.64). The vessel courses inferiorly over the pelvic inlet and then divides into anterior and posterior trunks at the level of  the superior border of  the greater sciatic foramen. Branches from the posterior trunk contribute to the supply of  the lower posterior abdominal wall, the posterior pelvic wall, and the gluteal region. Branches from the anterior trunk supply the pelvic viscera, the perineum, the gluteal region, the adductor region of  the thigh, and, in the fetus, the placenta.\nPosterior trunk\nBranches of  the posterior trunk of  the internal iliac artery are the iliolumbar artery , the lateral sacral artery , and the superior gluteal artery (Fig. 5.64).\n\u25a0 The iliolumbar artery ascends laterally back out of  \nthe pelvic inlet and divides into a lumbar branch and an iliac branch. The lumbar branch contributes to the supply of  the posterior abdominal wall, psoas and qua -\ndratus lumborum muscles, and cauda equina, via a small spinal branch that passes through the interverte -\nbral foramen between LV and SI. The iliac branch passes laterally into the iliac fossa to supply muscle and bone.\n\u25a0 The lateral sacral arteries , usually two, originate \nfrom the posterior division of  the internal iliac artery and course medially and inferiorly along the posterior pelvic wall. They give rise to branches that pass into the anterior sacral foramina to supply related bone and soft tissues, structures in the vertebral (sacral) canal, and skin and muscle posterior to the sacrum.\n\u25a0 The superior gluteal artery is the largest branch of  \nthe internal iliac artery and is the terminal continua -\ntion of  the posterior trunk. It courses posteriorly , usually passing between the lumbosacral trunk and anterior ramus of  S1, to leave the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle and enter the gluteal region of  the lower limb. This vessel makes a substantial contribution to the blood supply of  muscles and skin in the gluteal region and also supplies branches to adjacent muscles and bones of  the pelvic walls."

Significantly , the two tri-angles are not in the same plane. In the anatomical posi -\ntion, the urogenital triangle is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas the anal triangle is tilted upward at the transtubercular line so that it faces more posteriorly .\nThe roof  of  the perineum is formed mainly by the levator \nani muscles that separate the pelvic cavity , above, from the perineum, below . These muscles, one on each side, form a cone- or funnel-shaped pelvic diaphragm, with the anal aperture at its inferior apex in the anal triangle.\nAnteriorly , in the urogenital triangle , a U-shaped \ndefect in the muscles, the urogenital hiatus, allows the passage of  the urethra and vagina.\nPerineal membrane and deep perineal pouch\nThe perineal membrane (see pp. 449\u2013451) is a thick fibrous sheet that fills the urogenital triangle (Fig. 5.69B). It has a free posterior border, which is anchored in the midline to the perineal body and is attached laterally to the pubic arch. Immediately superior to the perineal membrane is a thin region termed the deep perineal pouch, containing a layer of  skeletal muscle and neurovascular tissues. Among the skeletal muscles in the pouch (see p. 451, Fig. 5.37) is the external urethral sphincter.\nThe perineal membrane and deep perineal pouch \nprovide support for the external genitalia, which are attached to its inferior surface. Also, the parts of  the peri -\nneal membrane and deep perineal pouch inferior to the urogenital hiatus in the levator ani provide support for the pelvic viscera, above.\nThe urethra leaves the pelvic cavity and enters the \nperineum by passing through the deep perineal pouch  \nand perineal membrane. In women, the vagina also passes through these structures posterior to the urethra.and drain, via vessels that accompany the ovarian arteries, directly into lateral aortic or lumbar nodes and, in some cases, into the pre-aortic nodes on the anterior surface of  the aorta.\nIn addition to draining pelvic viscera, nodes along the \ninternal iliac artery also receive drainage from the gluteal region of  the lower limb and from deep areas of  the perineum.\nPERINEUM\nThe perineum is a diamond-shaped region positioned inferiorly to the pelvic floor between the thighs. Its periph -\neral boundary is the pelvic outlet; its ceiling is the pelvic diaphragm (the levator ani and coccygeus muscles); and its narrow lateral walls are formed by the walls of  the pelvic cavity below the attachment of  the levator ani muscle (Fig. 5.69A).\nThe perineum is divided into an anterior urogenital \ntriangle and a posterior anal triangle.\n\u25a0 The uro genital triangle is associated with the openings \nof  the urinary systems and the reproductive systems and functions to anchor the external genitalia.\n\u25a0 The anal triang le contains the anus and the external \nanal sphincter.\nThe pudendal nerve (S2 to S4) and the internal puden -\ndal artery are the major nerve and artery of  the region.\nBorders and ceiling\nThe margin of  the perineum is marked by the inferior \nborder of  the pubic symphysis at its anterior point, the tip of  the coccyx at its posterior point, and the ischial tuberosi -\nties at each of  the lateral points (Fig. 5.69A). The lateral margins are formed by the ischiopubic rami anteriorly and by the sacrotuberous ligaments posteriorly .

In the anal triangle, these gutters, one on each side of  the anal aperture, are termed ischio-anal fossae. The \nlateral wall of  each fossa is formed mainly by the ischium, obturator internus muscle, and sacrotuberous ligament. The medial wall is the levator ani muscle. The medial and lateral walls converge superiorly where the levator ani muscle attaches to the fascia overlying the obturator inter -\nnus muscle. The ischio-anal fossae allow movement of  the pelvic diaphragm and expansion of  the anal canal during defecation.\nThe ischio-anal fossae of  the anal triangle are continu -\nous anteriorly with recesses that project into the urogenital triangle superior to the deep perineal pouch. These anterior recesses of  the ischio-anal fossae are shaped like three-sided pyramids that have been tipped onto one of  their sides (Fig. 5.70C). The apex of  each pyramid is closed and points anteriorly toward the pubis. The base is open and continu -\nous posteriorly with its related ischio-anal fossa. The infe -\nrior wall of  each pyramid is the deep perineal pouch. The superomedial wall is the levator ani muscle, and the superolateral wall is formed mainly by the obturator inter -\nnus muscle. The ischio-anal fossae and their anterior recesses are normally filled with fat.\nIn the clinic\nAbscesses in the ischio-anal fossae\nThe anal mucosa is particularly vulnerable to injury and \nmay be easily torn by hard feces. Occasionally, patients develop inflammation and infection of the anal canal \n(sinuses or crypts). This infection can spread between the \nsphincters, producing intersphincteric fistulas. The infection can tract superiorly into the pelvic cavity or laterally into the ischio-anal fossae.In the clinic\nHemorrhoids\nA hemorrhoid is an engorgement of the venous plexus at or inside the anal sphincter. It is a common complaint and has prevalence of approximately 4% in the United States. \nHemorrhoids have a slight genetic predisposition; \nhowever, straining during bowel movements, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle can also produce hemorrhoids. The symptoms include irritation, pain, and swelling. Hemorrhoids occurring at the anal verge (distal boundary \nof the anal canal) are typically called external \nhemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids occur inside the rectum and have a tendency to bleed. Prolapsed hemorrhoids are internal hemorrhoids that pass outside \nthe anal canal and form lumps, which may undergo \nthrombosis and become painful.\nThere are many treatments for hemorrhoids, which \ninclude ligation above the pectinate (dentate) line using simple rubber bands or surgical excision. Surgery to this \nregion is not without complications and care must be \ntaken to preserve the internal anal sphincter.\nIn the back of every physician\u2019s mind is the concern \nthat the rectal bleeding or symptoms may not be attributable to hemorrhoids. Therefore, excluding a tumor \nwithin the bowel is as important as treating the \nhemorrhoids.Anal triangle\nThe anal triangle of  the perineum faces posteroinferiorly \nand is defined laterally by the medial margins of  the sacro-tuberous ligaments, anteriorly by a horizontal line between the two ischial tuberosities, and posteriorly by the coccyx. The ceiling of  the anal triangle is the pelvic diaphragm, which is formed by the levator ani and coccygeus muscles. The anal aperture occurs centrally in the anal triangle and is related on either side to an ischio-anal fossa. The major muscle in the anal triangle is the external anal sphincter.\nThe external anal sphincter, which surrounds  \nthe anal canal, is formed by skeletal muscle and consists  \nof  three parts\u2014deep, superficial, and subcutaneous\u2014arranged sequentially along the canal from superior to inferior (Fig. 5.69B, Table 5.5). The deep part is a thick \nring-shaped muscle that circles the upper part of  the anal canal and blends with the fibers of  the levator ani muscle. The superficial part also surrounds the anal canal, but is anchored anteriorly to the perineal body and posteriorly to the coccyx and anococcygeal ligament. The subcutaneous part is a horizontally flattened disc of  muscle that sur -\nrounds the anal aperture just beneath the skin. The external anal sphincter is innervated by inferior rectal branches of  the pudendal nerve and by branches directly from the anterior ramus of  S4."

These attached parts are often termed the crura (from the Latin for \u201clegs\u201d) of  \nthe clitoris or the penis. The distal ends of  the corpora, which are not attached to bone, form the body of  the clito -\nris in women and the dorsal parts of  the body of  the penis in men.\nThe second set of  erectile tissues surrounds the open -\nings of  the urogenital system.\n\u25a0 In w omen, a pair of  erectile structures, termed the \nbulbs of  the vestibule , are situated, one on each side, \nat the vaginal opening and are firmly anchored to the perineal membrane (Fig. 5.71A). Small bands of  erectile tissues connect the anterior ends of  these bulbs to a single, small, pea-shaped erectile mass, the glans clito-\nris, which is positioned in the midline at the end of  the body of  the clitoris and anterior to the opening of  the urethra.\n\u25a0 In men, a sing le large erectile mass, the corpus spon-\ngiosum, is the structural equivalent to the bulbs of  the vestibule, the glans clitoris, and the interconnecting bands of  erectile tissues in women (Fig. 5.71B). The corpus spongiosum is anchored at its base to the peri -\nneal membrane. Its proximal end, which is not attached, forms the ventral part of  the body of  the penis and expands over the end of  the body of  the penis to form the glans penis. This pattern in men results from the absence of  a vaginal opening and from the fusion of  structures across the midline during embryological development. As the originally paired erectile structures fuse, they enclose the urethral opening and form an additional channel that ultimately becomes most of  the penile part of  the urethra. As a consequence of  this fusion and growth in men, the urethra is enclosed by the corpus spongiosum and opens at the end of  the Urogenital triangle\nThe urogenital triangle of  the perineum is the anterior half  of  the perineum and is oriented in the horizontal plane. It contains the roots of  the external genitalia (Fig. 5.71) and the openings of  the urogenital system.\nThe urogenital triangle is defined:\n\u25a0 la terally by the ischiopubic rami,\n\u25a0 posteriorl y by an imaginary line between the ischial \ntuberosities, and\n\u25a0 anteriorl y by the inferior margin of  the pubic \nsymphysis.\nAs with the anal triangle, the roof  or ceiling of  the \nurogenital triangle is the levator ani muscle.\nUnlike the anal triangle, the urogenital triangle contains \na strong fibromuscular support platform, the perineal \nmembrane and deep perineal pouch (see pp. 449\u2013451), which is attached to the pubic arch.\nAnterior extensions of  the ischio-anal fossae occur \nbetween the deep perineal pouch and the levator ani muscle on each side.\nBetween the perineal membrane and the membranous \nlayer of  superficial fascia is the superficial perineal pouch. The principal structures in this pouch are the erectile tissues of  the penis and clitoris and associated skeletal muscles.\nStructures in the superficial perineal pouch\nThe superficial perineal pouch contains:\n\u25a0 erectile structures that join together to form the penis in \nmen and the clitoris in women, and\n\u25a0 sk eletal muscles that are associated mainly with parts \nof  the erectile structures attached to the perineal mem -\nbrane and adjacent bone.\nEach erectile structure consists of  a central core of  \nexpandable vascular tissue and its surrounding connective \ntissue capsule.Table 5.5  Muscles o f the anal triangle\nMuscles Origin Insertion Innervation Function\nEXTERNAL ANAL SPHINCTER Closes anal canal\nDeep part Surrounds superior aspect of anal canal Pudendal nerve (S2 and S3) \nand branches directly from S4\nSuperficial part Surrounds lower part of anal canal Anchored to perineal body and anococcygeal body\nSubcutaneous part Surrounds anal aperture"

They are small, pea-shaped mucous glands that lie posterior to the bulbs of  the vestibule on each side of  the vaginal opening and are the female homologues of  the bulbo-urethral glands in men (Fig. 5.71). However, the bulbo-urethral glands are located within the deep perineal pouch, whereas the greater vestibular glands are in the superficial perineal pouch.\nThe duct of  each greater vestibular gland opens into the \nvestibule of  the perineum along the posterolateral margin of  the vaginal opening.\nLike the bulbo-urethral glands in men, the greater ves -\ntibular glands produce secretion during sexual arousal.\nMuscles\nThe superficial perineal pouch contains three pairs of  muscles: the ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, and superficial transverse perineal muscles (Fig. 5.72 and  \nTable 5.6).

Other fibers course anterolaterally to blend with the fibers of  the ischiocavernosus muscle, and still others travel anteriorly and arch over the body of  the clitoris.\nIn men, the bulbospongiosus muscles are joined in the \nmidline to a raphe on the inferior surface of  the bulb of  the penis. The raphe is anchored posteriorly to the perineal body . Muscle fibers course anterolaterally , on each side, from the raphe and perineal body to cover each side of  the The body of  the clitoris is supported by a suspensory  \nligament that attaches superiorly to the pubic symphysis.

The glans clitoris is exposed in the \nperineum and the body of  the clitoris can be palpated through skin.\nPenis\nThe penis is composed mainly of  the two corpora cavernosa and the single corpus spongiosum, which contains the urethra (Fig. 5.71B.)

Bulbospongiosus muscle is \ninnervated by somatic motor fibers carried in the pudendal \nnerve (S2\u2013S4). Contraction of the internal urethral sphincter \nand periurethral smooth muscle, innervated by the \nsympathetic part of the visceral nervous system, prevents \nretrograde ejaculation into the bladder.\nIn the clinic\nErectile dysfunction\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is a complex condition in which \nmen are unable to initiate or maintain penile erection. When \nthis affects erections during sleep, and with self-stimulation \nas well as with a partner, vascular and/or nerve impairment \nis present. This generalized type of ED increases with age \nand is recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease. \nIt is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease, \ndiabetes, and neurological conditions including Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and as nerve \ndamage from pelvic surgeries or radiation for pelvic \nmalignancies. Low testosterone states can impair erections \nand consistently prevent sleep-induced erections. \nMedications including serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), \nthiazides and anti-androgens can also underlie ED. When \nonly partnered erections are problematic, psychological \nfactors underlie the dysfunction\u2014the normal erections from \nsleep confirming healthy vascular and neurological function. \nMost cases of ED are multifactorial in etiology, and all \nmarkedly lessen quality of life and a person\u2019s well-being and \ncan lead to depression and low self-esteem as well as \nemotional and social isolation.\nDelayed (or absent) ejaculation can result from nerve \ndamage in conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, \nspinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, complications after major pelvic surgeries and pelvic irradiation. Ejaculation is \nabsent after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (which \nalso removes the seminal vesicles), but orgasm is still \npossible as the pudendal nerve is spared. SSRIs, \nneuroleptics, alcohol, and recreational drugs (marijuana, \ncocaine, and heroin) often delay orgasm and therefore \nejaculation, as in health the two coincide (even though the \nnerves involved are different).\nBecause erectile tissues in the clitoris have similar \ninnervation and blood supply to the penis, vulvar swelling is \nlikely compromised by the same conditions that cause ED in \nmen. However, it appears that this is a rare cause of female \nsexual dysfunction. Reduced clitoral swelling is rarely \nsymptomatic. Note that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) \ninhibitors (sildenafil) do not improve female sexual \ndysfunction even in conditions such as diabetes. Research \nconfirms that otherwise healthy women with complaints of \nlow sexual arousal have a physiologically normal increase in \ngenital congestion in response to visual sexual stimuli, even \nthough they do not find the stimuli mentally sexually \narousing. Loss of genital sexual sensitivity from somatic \nnerve damage from multiple sclerosis or diabetes can be \nhighly symptomatic and preclude orgasm. Medications \npreventing orgasm in men can also affect women.regions, mainly the glans. In men, the bulbospongiosus \nmuscles have two additional functions:\n\u25a0 They facilitate emptying of  the bulbous part of  the \npenile urethra following urination (micturition).\n\u25a0 Their reflex contraction during ejaculation is responsible \nfor the pulsatile emission of  semen from the penis."

In the lower lateral abdominal wall, the membranous layer of  abdominal fascia is attached to the deep fascia of  the thigh just inferior to the inguinal ligament.\nBecause the membranous layer of  fascia encloses the \nsuperficial perineal pouch and continues up the anterior abdominal wall, fluids or infectious materials that accumu -\nlate in the pouch can track out of  the perineum and onto the lower abdominal wall. This material will not track into the anal triangle or the thigh because the fascia fuses with deep tissues at the borders of  these regions.and their associated musculofascial coverings, blood vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and drainage ducts descend from the abdomen. The remnant of  the line of  fusion between the labioscrotal swellings in the fetus is visible on the skin of  the scrotum as a longitudinal midline raphe \nthat extends from the anus, over the scrotal sac, and onto the inferior aspect of  the body of  the penis.\nThe penis consists of  a root and body . The attached root \nof  the penis is palpable posterior to the scrotum in the urogenital triangle of  the perineum.  The pendulous part of  \nthe penis (body of  penis) is entirely covered by skin; the tip of  the body is covered by the glans penis.\nThe external urethral orifice is a sagittal slit, normally \npositioned at the tip of  the glans. The inferior margin of  the urethral orifice is continuous with a midline raphe of  \nthe penis, which represents a line of  fusion formed in the glans as the urethra develops in the fetus. The base of  this raphe is continuous with the frenulum of  the glans, \nwhich is a median fold of  skin that attaches the glans to more loosely attached skin proximal to the glans. The base of  the glans is expanded to form a raised circular margin (the corona of  the glans ); the two lateral ends of  the \ncorona join inferiorly at the midline raphe of  the glans. The depression posterior to the corona is the neck of  the glans. Normally , a fold of  skin at the neck of  the glans is continu -\nous anteriorly with thin skin that tightly adheres to the glans and posteriorly with thicker skin loosely attached to the body . This fold, known as the prepuce, extends forward to cover the glans. The prepuce is removed during male circumcision, leaving the glans exposed.\nSuperficial fascia of the urogenital triangle\nThe superficial fascia of  the urogenital triangle is continu -\nous with similar fascia on the anterior abdominal wall.\nAs with the superficial fascia of  the abdominal wall, the \nperineal fascia has a membranous layer on its deep surface. This membranous layer ( Colles\u2019 fascia), is attached:\n\u25a0 posteriorl y to the perineal membrane and therefore does \nnot extend into the anal triangle (Fig. 5.75), and\n\u25a0 to the ischiopubic r ami that form the lateral borders  \nof  the urogenital triangle and therefore does not extend into the thigh (Fig. 5.75).In the clinic\nUrethral rupture\nUrethral rupture may occur at a series of well-defined \nanatomical points.\nThe commonest injury is a rupture of the proximal \nspongy urethra below the perineal membrane. The urethra is usually torn when structures of the perineum are caught between a hard object (e.g., a steel beam or crossbar of a bicycle) and the inferior pubic arch. Urine escapes through the rupture into the superficial perineal pouch and \ndescends into the scrotum and up onto the anterior \nabdominal wall deep to the superficial fascia.\nIn association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral \nrupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction \nabove the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate \ninto the true pelvis.\nThe worst and most serious urethral rupture is related \nto serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is \ndislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous \ndisruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination."

He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During \nexamination, the physician palpated the left testis, which \nwas normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a \u201cbag of worms\u201d (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.\nThe venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform \nplexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A \nvaricocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the \npampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to \nvaricose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient \ncomplains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.\nThe family physician recommended surgical treatment, with \na recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.\nA simple surgical technique divides the skin around  \nthe inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external \noblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the \nspermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.\nAnother option is to embolize the varicocele.In this technique, a small catheter is placed via the right \nfemoral vein. The catheter is advanced along the external \niliac vein and the common iliac vein and into the inferior vena cava. The catheter is then positioned in the left renal vein, and a venogram is performed to demonstrate the origin of the left testicular vein. The catheter is advanced \ndown the left testicular vein into the veins of the inguinal \ncanal and the pampiniform plexus. Metal coils to occlude the vessels are injected, and the catheter is withdrawn.\nThe patient asked how blood would drain from the testis \nafter the operation.\nAlthough the major veins of the testis had been occluded, \nsmall collateral veins running within the scrotum and around the outer aspect of the spermatic cord permitted drainage without recurrence of the varicocele."

The patient also reported feeling \nnauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have \ndiarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours \nbefore admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She \nwas afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a \nnormal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild \nleukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver \nfunction tests. She reported being sexually active with a \nlong-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine \npregnancy test on admission was negative.\nOn physical examination there was tenderness in the right \niliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender \nmass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient \nsubsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound \nexamination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan \nshowed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to \n8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally \ndistributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when \ncolor Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was \nseen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian \ntorsion was made.\nOvarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory \nligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a \ncompromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and \nlymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian \nedema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained \nlonger due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. \nProlonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian \npressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, \nischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct \ndiagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may \ndevelop generalized sepsis.\nThe symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of \novarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past \nmedical history.\nAt surgery, the right ovary was hemorrhagic and necrotic \nwith the pedicle twisted 360 degrees. The left ovary was \nnormal in appearance. Right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy \nwas performed, and histopathological examination \nconfirmed completely necrotic ovary without any residual \nnormal ovarian tissue. The patient made a quick recovery \nafter surgical intervention.\nOvarian torsion is encountered in women of all ages, but \nthose of reproductive age have much higher prevalence. \nT orsion of a normal ovary is uncommon and is seen more \nfrequently in adolescent population, with elongated pelvic \nligaments, fallopian tube spasm, or more mobile fallopian \ntubes or mesosalpinx cited as contributing factors."

The mass was anterior to the piriformis muscle and adjacent to the rectum.\nOn the anterior belly of the piriformis muscle, the sciatic \nnerve is formed from the roots of L4 to S3 nerves. The mass \nin the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction.\nDuring surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve \ntumor and was excised.

After a short  \nperiod of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before  \nthe same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that  \nover the past year he was unable to obtain an erection.  \nHe smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment.\nThe pain in the left buttock is ischemic in nature. He gives a \ntypical history relating to lack of blood flow to the muscles. \nA similar finding is present when muscular branches of the femoral artery are occluded or stenosed. Such patients develop similar (ischemic) pain in the calf muscles called intermittent claudication.How does the blood get to the gluteal muscles?\nBlood arrives at the aortic bifurcation and then passes  \ninto the common iliac arteries, which divide into the internal \nand external iliac vessels. The internal iliac artery then divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which in  \nturn give rise to vessels that leave the pelvis by passing through the greater sciatic foramen and supply the gluteal \nmuscles. The internal pudendal artery also arises from the \nanterior division of the internal iliac artery and supplies the penis.\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms occur on the left side, suggesting \nthat an obstruction exists on that side only.\nBecause the patient\u2019s symptoms occur on the left side only, \nthe lesion is likely in the left common iliac artery (eFig. 5.88) and is preventing blood flow into the external and internal \niliac arteries on the left side.\n(continues)"

The \nsurgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.\nThe typical history for appendicitis is a central abdominal, \ncolicky (intermittent waxing and waning) pain, which over a \nperiod of hours localizes to become a constant pain in the \nright iliac fossa. The central colicky pain is typical for a \npoorly localized visceral type of pain. As the parietal \nperitoneum becomes inflamed, the pain becomes localized. \nAlthough this patient does have right iliac fossa pain, the \nhistory is not typical for appendicitis (although it must be \nremembered that patients may not always have a classical \nhistory for appendicitis).\nThe surgical intern asked a more senior colleague for an \nopinion.\nThe senior colleague considered other anatomical structures \nthat lie within the right iliac fossa as a potential cause of \npain. These include the appendix, the cecum, and the small bowel. Musculoskeletal pain and referred pain could also be \npotential causes. In women, pain may also arise from the \novary, fallopian tube, and uterus. In a young patient, \ndiseases of these organs are rare. Infection and pelvic \ninflammatory disease may occur in the younger patient and \nneed to be considered.\nThe patient gave no history of these disorders.\nUpon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that \nher last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this \nexamination. The senior physician realized that a potential \ncause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the \nuterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an \nabdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the \nuterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy \ntest. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have \na ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy.\nWhenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important \nto consider the gender-related anatomical differences. \nEctopic pregnancy should always be considered in women \nof childbearing age.\nCase 6\nIATROGENIC URETERIC INJURY\nA 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical \nresection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The \nsurgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph \nnodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy \n(removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was \nprepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. \nTwenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the \npatient had passed no urine and her abdomen was \nexpanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a \nconsiderable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid \nwithdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be \nurine.\nIt was postulated that this patient\u2019s ureters had been \ndamaged during the surgery.\nThe pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and \nexternal to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its \ncourse to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial \nspine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the \nlevator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres \nto the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between \nthe ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. \nIn women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic \nwall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues \nclose to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the \nleft, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.  \nIt was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently \ndamaged.\nKnowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of \nureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish \ncontinuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was \nhospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an \nuneventful recovery."

The family practitioner examined the \nlower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from \nthe superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The \nsuperior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the \ninferior margin appeared to be less well defined.\nThis patient has a pelvic mass.\nWhen examining a patient in the supine position, the \nobserver should uncover the whole of the abdomen.\nInspection revealed a bulge in the lower abdomen to the \nlevel of the umbilicus. Palpation revealed a hard and slightly \nirregular mass with well-defined superior and lateral borders \nand a less well-defined inferior border, giving the impression \nthat the mass continued into the pelvis. The lesion was dull \nto percussion. Auscultation did not reveal any abnormal \nsounds.\nThe doctor pondered which structures this mass may be \narising from. When examining the pelvis, it is important to \nremember the sex differences. Common to both men and \nwomen are the rectum, bowel, bladder, and musculature. \nCertain pathological states are also common to both sexes, \nincluding the development of pelvic abscesses and fluid \ncollections.\nIn men, the prostate cannot be palpated transabdominally, \nand it is extremely rare for it to enlarge to such an extent in \nbenign diseases. Aggressive prostate cancer can spread throughout the whole of the pelvis, although this is often \nassociated with bowel obstruction and severe bladder \nsymptoms.\nIn women, a number of organs can develop large masses, \nincluding the ovaries (solid and cystic tumors), the \nembryological remnants within the broad ligaments, and the \nuterus (pregnancy and fibroids).\nThe physician asked further questions.\nIt is always important to establish whether the patient is \npregnant (occasionally, pregnancy may come as a surprise to \nthe patient).\nThis patient\u2019s pregnancy test was negative. After the patient \nemptied her bladder, there was no change in the mass. The \nphysician thought the mass might be a common benign \ntumor of the uterus (fibroid). T o establish the diagnosis, he \nobtained an ultrasound scan of the pelvis, which confirmed \nthat the mass stemmed from the uterus.\nThe patient was referred to a gynecologist, and after a long \ndiscussion regarding her symptomatology, fertility, and risks, \nthe surgeon and the patient agreed that a hysterectomy \n(surgical removal of the uterus) would be an appropriate \ncourse of therapy.\nThe patient sought a series of opinions from other \ngynecologists, all of whom agreed that surgery was the \nappropriate option.\nThe fibroid was removed with no complications."

When standing erect, the center of  gravity is anterior to the edge of  the SII vertebra in the pelvis (Fig. 6.4). The vertical line through the center of  gravity is slightly posterior to the  \nhip joints, anterior to the knee and ankle joints, and  \ndirectly over the almost circular support base formed by the feet on the ground and holds the knee and hip joints in extension.\nThe organization of  ligaments at the hip and knee joints, \ntogether with the shape of  the articular surfaces, particu -\nlarly at the knee, facilitates \u201clocking\u201d of  these joints into position when standing, thereby reducing the muscular energy required to maintain a standing position.\nLocomotion\nA second major function of  the lower limbs is to move the body through space. This involves the integration of  move -\nments at all joints in the lower limb to position the foot on the ground and to move the body over the foot.The femoral triangle and popliteal fossa, as well as the \nposteromedial side of  the ankle, are important areas of  transition through which structures pass between regions (Fig. 6.3).\nThe femoral triangle is a pyramid-shaped depression \nformed by muscles in the proximal regions of  the thigh  \nand by the inguinal ligament, which forms the base of  the triangle. The major blood supply and one of  the nerves of  the limb (femoral nerve) enter into the thigh from the abdomen by passing under the inguinal ligament and into the femoral triangle.\nThe popliteal fossa is posterior to the knee joint and is \na diamond-shaped region formed by muscles of  the thigh and leg. Major vessels and nerves pass between the thigh and leg through the popliteal fossa.\nMost nerves, vessels, and flexor tendons that pass \nbetween the leg and foot pass through a series of  canals (collectively termed the tarsal tunnel) on the posteromedial side of  the ankle. The canals are formed by adjacent bones and a flexor retinaculum, which holds the tendons in position.\nFig. 6.3  Ar eas of transition. \nInguinal ligament\nFemoral triangle\nPopliteal fossa\n(posterior to knee)\nTarsal tunnel\nFig. 6.4  C enter and line of gravity. \nCenter of\ngravityCenter\nof gravity\nposterior to\nhip joint\nLine of gravityAnterior to knee\nAnterior to ankle"

This type of  hernia usually occurs where the lymphatic vessels pass through the gap (the femoral canal).\nPelvis\nStructures within the pelvis communicate with the lower limb through two major apertures (Fig. 6.14).\nPosteriorly , structures communicate with the gluteal \nregion through the greater sciatic foramen and include:\n\u25a0 a m uscle\u2014piriformis;\n\u25a0 ner ves\u2014sciatic, superior and inferior gluteal, and \npudendal nerves; and\n\u25a0 v essels\u2014superior and inferior gluteal arteries and veins, \nand the internal pudendal artery .\nThe sciatic nerve is the largest peripheral nerve of  the \nbody and is the major nerve of  the lower limb.\nAnteriorly , the obturator nerve and vessels pass between \nthe pelvis and thigh through the obturator canal. This \ncanal is formed between bone at the top of  the obturator foramen and the obturator membrane, which closes most of  the foramen during life.\nPerineum\nStructures pass between the perineum and gluteal region through the lesser sciatic foramen (Fig. 6.14). The most important with respect to the lower limb is the tendon of  the obturator internus muscle.\nThe nerve and artery of  the perineum (the internal \npudendal artery and pudendal nerve) pass out of  the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen into the gluteal region and then immediately pass around the ischial spine and sacrospinous ligament and through the lesser sciatic foramen to enter the perineum.\nKEY POINTS\nInnervation is by lumbar and sacral  \nspinal nerves\nSomatic motor and general sensory innervation of  the \nlower limb is by peripheral nerves emanating from the lumbar and sacral plexuses on the posterior abdominal and pelvic walls. These plexuses are formed by the anterior rami of  L1 to L3 and most of  L4 (lumbar plexus) and L4 to S5 (sacral plexus).\nFig. 6.14  Aper tures of communication between the lower limb \nand other regions. \nObturator membrane\nLesser sciatic foramenGreater sciatic foramen\nObturator canalInguinal ligamentSacrotuberous ligament\nSacrospinous ligament\nGap between inguinal\nligament and pelvic boneRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGIONS\nUnlike in the upper limb where most structures pass between the neck and limb through a single axillary inlet, in the lower limb, there are four major entry and exit points between the lower limb and the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum (Fig. 6.14). These are:\n\u25a0 the g ap between the inguinal ligament and pelvic bone,\n\u25a0 the g reater sciatic foramen,\n\u25a0 the obtur ator canal (at the top of  the obturator foramen), \nand\n\u25a0 the lesser scia tic foramen.\nAbdomen\nThe lower limb communicates directly with the abdomen through a gap between the pelvic bone and the inguinal ligament (Fig. 6.14). Structures passing though this gap include:\n\u25a0 m uscles\u2014psoas major, iliacus, and pectineus;\n\u25a0 ner ves\u2014femoral and femoral branch of  the genitofemo -\nral nerves, and the lateral cutaneous nerve of  the thigh;\n\u25a0 v essels\u2014femoral artery and vein; and\n\u25a0 lymphatics."

In addition, this bleeding tends to form  \na significant pelvic hematoma, which can compress  \nnerves, press on organs, and inhibit pelvic visceral function \n(Fig. 6.25).\nThere are many ways of classifying pelvic fractures, \nwhich enable the surgeon to determine the appropriate treatment and the patient\u2019s prognosis. Pelvic fractures are generally of four types.\n\u25a0 T ype 1 injuries occur without disruption of the bony \npelvic ring (e.g., a fracture of the iliac crest).

The blood supply to the head and neck is primarily from an arterial ring formed by the \nbranches of the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries \naround the base of the femoral neck. From here, vessels course along the neck, penetrate the capsule, and supply the femoral head. The blood supply to the femoral head and femoral neck is further enhanced by the artery of the \nligamentum teres, a branch of the obturator artery, which is \ngenerally small and variable. Femoral neck fractures may disrupt associated vessels and lead to necrosis of the femoral head. Femoral neck fractures can be divided into three \ncategories depending on the location of the fracture line: \nsubcapital (fracture line passes across the femoral head-neck junction), transcervical (fracture line passes through the midportion of the femoral neck), and basicervical (fracture line passes across the base of the neck). Subcapital fractures \nhave the highest risk of developing necrosis of the femoral \nhead, and basicervical fractures have the lowest risk. Elderly patients with osteoporosis tend to have transverse subcapital fractures following low-energy trauma such as a fall from  \na standing height. Conversely, younger patients usually \nsustain more vertical fractures of the distal femoral neck \n(basicervical) after high-energy trauma such as a fall from a great height or due to axial load applied to an abducted knee, such as during a motor vehicle accident.\nFig. 6.28  This radiograph of the pelvis, ant eroposterior view, \ndemonstrates a fracture of the neck of the femur. \nFractured neck of femur"

This type of injury is therefore accompanied by damage to the surrounding soft tissues, which include \nthe muscle compartments and the structures they contain.In the clinic\nIntertrochanteric fractures\nIn these fractures, the break usually runs from the greater \ntrochanter through to the lesser trochanter and does not involve the femoral neck. Intertrochanteric fractures preserve \nthe femoral neck blood supply and do not render the \nfemoral head ischemic. They are most commonly seen in the elderly and result from low-energy impact (Fig. 6.29).\nSometimes isolated fractures of the greater or the lesser \ntrochanter can occur. An isolated fracture of the lesser \ntrochanter in adults is most commonly pathological and due \nto an underlying malignant deposit.\nFig. 6.29  Ant eroposterior radiograph showing an \nintertrochanteric fracture of proximal end of femur. \nIntertrochanteric \nfracture\nHip joint\nThe hip joint is a synovial articulation between the head of  \nthe femur and the acetabulum of  the pelvic bone (Fig. 6.30A). The joint is a multiaxial ball and socket joint designed for stability and weight-bearing at the expense of  mobility . Movements at the joint include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction.\nWhen considering the effects of  muscle action on the \nhip joint, the long neck of  the femur and the angulation  \nof  the neck on the shaft of  the femur must be borne  in mind. For example, medial and lateral rotation of  the femur involves muscles that move the greater trochanter forward and backward, respectively , relative to the acetabu -\nlum (Fig. 6.30B).\nThe articular surfaces of  the hip joint are:\n\u25a0 the spherical head of  the femur, and\n\u25a0 the luna te surface of  the acetabulum of  the pelvic bone.\nThe acetabulum almost entirely encompasses the hemi -\nspherical head of  the femur and contributes substantially to joint stability . The nonarticular acetabular fossa contains loose connective tissue. The lunate surface is covered by hyaline cartilage and is broadest superiorly .\nExcept for the fovea, the head of  the femur is also covered \nby hyaline cartilage.\nThe rim of  the acetabulum is raised slightly by a fibro -\ncartilaginous collar (the acetabular labrum). Inferiorly ,  \nthe labrum bridges across the acetabular notch as the transverse acetabular ligament and converts the notch into a foramen (Fig. 6.31A)."

The superior gluteal artery leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle, and the inferior gluteal artery leaves through the same foramen but below the piriformis muscle.piriformis muscle, and enters the gluteal region to supply the gluteus maximus.\nIlio-inguinal and genitofemoral nerves\nTerminal sensory branches of  the ilio-inguinal nerve (L1) and the genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) descend into the upper thigh from the lumbar plexus.\nThe ilio-inguinal nerve originates from the superior \npart of  the lumbar plexus, descends around the abdominal wall in the plane between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, and then passes through the inguinal canal to leave the abdominal wall through the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 6.36 and Table 6.1). Its ter -\nminal branches innervate skin on the medial side of  the upper thigh and adjacent parts of  the perineum.\nThe genitofemoral nerve  passes anteroinferiorly \nthrough the psoas major muscle on the posterior abdomi -\nnal wall and descends on the anterior surface of  the psoas major (Fig. 6.36 and Table 6.1). Its genital branch inner -\nvates anterior aspects of  the perineum. Its femoral branch passes into the thigh by crossing under the inguinal liga-ment where it is lateral to the femoral artery . It passes superficially to innervate skin over the upper central part of  the anterior thigh.\nLateral cutaneous nerve of thigh\nThe lateral cutaneous nerve of  the thigh originates \nfrom L2 and L3. It leaves the abdomen either by passing through the gap between the inguinal ligament and the pelvic bone just medial to the anterior superior iliac spine or by passing directly through the inguinal ligament (Fig. 6.36 and Table 6.1). It supplies skin on the lateral side of  \nthe thigh.\nNerve to quadratus femoris and nerve  \nto obturator internus\nThe nerve to the quadratus femoris  (L4 to S1) and the \nnerve to the obturator internus  (L5 to S2) are small \nmotor nerves that originate from the sacral plexus. Both nerves pass through the greater sciatic foramen inferior to the piriformis muscle and enter the gluteal region (Fig. 6.36 and Table 6.1):\n\u25a0 The ner ve to the obturator internus supplies the gemel -\nlus superior muscle in the gluteal region and then loops around the ischial spine and enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen to penetrate the peri-neal surface of  the obturator internus muscle."

Venous return is supplemented with contraction of \nthe muscles in the lower limb, which pump the blood \ntoward the heart. When venous valves become incompetent \nthey tend to place extra pressure on more distal valves, \nwhich may also become incompetent. This condition \nproduces dilated tortuous superficial veins (varicose veins) in \nthe distribution of the great (long) and small (short) \nsaphenous venous systems.\nVaricose veins occur more commonly in women than in \nmen, and symptoms are often aggravated by pregnancy. \nSome individuals have a genetic predisposition to \ndeveloping varicose veins. Valves may also be destroyed \nwhen a deep vein thrombosis occurs if the clot incorporates the valve into its interstices; during the process of healing \nand recanalization the valve is destroyed, rendering it \nincompetent.\nTypical sites for valvular incompetence include the \njunction between the great (long) saphenous vein and the \nfemoral vein, perforating veins in the midthigh, and the \njunction between the small (short) saphenous vein and the \npopliteal vein.\nVaricose veins may be unsightly, and soft tissue changes \nmay occur with chronic venous incompetence. As the \nvenous pressure rises, increased venular and capillary \npressure damages the cells, and blood and blood products \nextrude into the soft tissue. This may produce a brown \npigmentation in the skin, and venous eczema may develop. \nFurthermore, if the pressure remains high the skin may \nbreak down and ulcerate, and many weeks of hospitalization \nmay be needed for this to heal.\nTreatments for varicose veins include tying off the valve, \n\u201cstripping\u201d (removing) the great (long) and small (short) \nsaphenous systems, and in some cases valvular \nreconstruction.\nIn the clinic\nDeep vein thrombosis\nThrombosis may occur in the deep veins of the lower limb \nand within the pelvic veins. Its etiology was eloquently \ndescribed by Virchow, who described the classic triad \n(venous stasis, injury to the vessel wall, and hypercoagulable \nstates) that precipitates thrombosis.\nIn some patients a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the calf \nveins may propagate into the femoral veins. This clot may \nbreak off and pass through the heart to enter the pulmonary \ncirculation, resulting in occlusion of the pulmonary artery, \ncardiopulmonary arrest, and death.\nA significant number of patients undergoing surgery are \nlikely to develop a DVT, so most surgical patients are given specific prophylactic treatment to prevent thrombosis. A \ntypical DVT prophylactic regimen includes anticoagulant \ninjections and graduated stockings (to prevent deep venous \nstasis and facilitate emptying of the deep veins).\nAlthough physicians aim to prevent the formation of DVT, \nit is not always possible to detect it because there may be \nno clinical signs. Calf muscle tenderness, postoperative \npyrexia, and limb swelling can be helpful clues. The \ndiagnosis is predominantly made by duplex Doppler \nsonography or rarely by ascending venography.\nIf DVT is confirmed, intravenous and oral anticoagulation \nare started to prevent extension of the thrombus."

The muscle fibers converge inferiorly and laterally to form a tendon, which inserts into a broad  \nlinear facet on the anterolateral aspect of  the greater trochanter.\nThe gluteus medius overlies the gluteus minimus and \nis also fan shaped. It has a broad origin from the external surface of  the ilium between the anterior gluteal line and posterior gluteal line and inserts on an elongate facet on the lateral surface of  the greater trochanter.\nThe gluteus medius and minimus muscles abduct the \nlower limb at the hip joint and reduce pelvic drop over the opposite swing limb during walking by securing the posi-tion of  the pelvis on the stance limb (Fig. 6.45B).

The gemellus muscles act with the obturator internus muscle to laterally rotate and abduct the femur at the hip joint.\nQuadratus femoris\nThe quadratus femoris muscle is the most inferior of  the \ndeep group of  muscles in the gluteal region (Fig. 6.45). It is a flat rectangular muscle below the obturator internus muscle and its associated gemellus muscles.\nThe quadratus femoris is attached at one end to a linear \nroughening on the lateral aspect of  the ischium just ante-rior to the ischial tuberosity and at the other end to the quadrate tubercle on the intertrochanteric crest of  the proximal femur.\nThe quadratus femoris laterally rotates the femur at the \nhip joint and is innervated by the nerve to the quadratus femoris.\nSuperficial group\nGluteus minimus and medius\nThe gluteus minimus and medius muscles are two  \nmuscles of  the more superficial group in the gluteal region (Fig. 6.45).In the clinic\nTrendelenburg\u2019s sign\nTrendelenburg\u2019s sign occurs in people with weak or \nparalyzed abductor muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) of the hip. The sign is demonstrated by asking \nthe patient to stand on one limb. When the patient stands \non the affected limb, the pelvis severely drops over the swing limb.\nPositive signs are typically found in patients with \ndamage to the superior gluteal nerve. Damage to this \nnerve may occur with associated pelvic fractures, with \nspace-occupying lesions within the pelvis extending into the greater sciatic foramen, and in some cases relating to hip surgery during which there has been disruption of and \nsubsequent atrophy of the insertion of the gluteus medius \nand gluteus minimus tendons on the greater trochanter.\nIn patients with a positive Trendelenburg\u2019s sign, gait \nalso is abnormal. Typically during the stance phase of the affected limb, the weakened abductor muscles allow the \npelvis to tilt inferiorly over the swing limb. The patient \ncompensates for the pelvic drop by lurching the trunk to the affected side to maintain the level of the pelvis throughout the gait cycle."

The medial supracon-\ndylar line terminates at a prominent tubercle (the adduc-tor tubercle) on the superior aspect of  the medial \ncondyle of  the distal end. Just lateral to the lower end of  the medial supracondylar line is an elongate roughened area of  bone for the proximal attachment of  the medial head of  the gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 6.52).\nThe distal end of  the femur is characterized by two large \ncondyles, which articulate with the proximal head of  the tibia. The condyles are separated posteriorly by an inter -\ncondylar fossa and are joined anteriorly where they articulate with the patella.\nThe surfaces of  the condyles that articulate with the \ntibia are rounded posteriorly and become flatter inferiorly . On each condyle, a shallow oblique groove separates the surface that articulates with the tibia from the more ante -\nrior surface that articulates with the patella. The surfaces of  the medial and lateral condyles that articulate with  \nthe patella form a V-shaped trench, which faces anteriorly . The lateral surface of  the trench is larger and steeper  \nthan the medial surface.\nThe walls of  the intercondylar fossa bear two facets for \nthe superior attachment of  the cruciate ligaments, which stabilize the knee joint (Fig. 6.53):\n\u25a0 The w all formed by the lateral surface of  the medial \ncondyle has a large oval facet, which covers most of  the inferior half  of  the wall, for attachment of  the proximal end of  the posterior cruciate ligament.\n\u25a0 The w all formed by the medial surface of  the lateral \ncondyle has a posterosuperior smaller oval facet for attachment of  the proximal end of  the anterior cruci-\nate ligament.\nEpicondyles, for the attachment of  collateral ligaments \nof  the knee joint, are bony elevations on the nonarticular \nouter surfaces of  the condyles (Fig. 6.53).

This \nregion is continuous with a similar surface on the front of  the tibia above the tuberosity and lies against infrapatellar connective tissue.\nTibial tuberosity\nThe tibial tuberosity is a palpable inverted triangular \narea on the anterior aspect of  the tibia below the site of  junction between the two condyles (Fig. 6.55). It is the site of  attachment for the patellar ligament, which is a \ncontinuation of  the quadriceps femoris tendon below the patella.\nShaft of  tibia\nThe shaft of  the tibia is triangular in cross section and has three surfaces (posterior, medial, and lateral) and three borders (anterior, interosseous, and medial) (Fig. 6.55D):\n\u25a0 The anterior border is sharp and descends from the \ntibial tuberosity where it is continuous superiorly with a ridge that passes along the lateral margin of  the tuberosity and onto the lateral condyle.\n\u25a0 The interosseous border is a subtle vertical ridge that \ndescends along the lateral aspect of  the tibia from the region of  bone anterior and inferior to the articular facet for the head of  the fibula.\n\u25a0 The medial border is indistinct superiorly where it  \nbegins at the anterior end of  the groove on the posterior surface of  the medial tibial condyle, but is sharp in midshaft.\nThe large medial surface of  the shaft of  the tibia, \nbetween the anterior and medial borders, is smooth and \nsubcutaneous, and is palpable along almost its entire extent. Medial and somewhat inferior to the tibial tuberos -\nity , this medial surface bears a subtle, slightly roughened elongate elevation. This elevation is the site of  the combined attachment of  three muscles (sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus), which descend from the thigh.\nThe posterior surface of  the shaft of  the tibia,  \nbetween the interosseous and medial borders, is widest superiorly where it is crossed by a roughened oblique line (the soleal line ).\nThe lateral surface, between the anterior and interos -\nseous borders, is smooth and unremarkable.\nProximal end of fibula\nThe fibula is the lateral bone of  the leg and does not take part in formation of  the knee joint or in weight-bearing. It is much smaller than the tibia and has a small proximal head, a narrow neck, and a delicate shaft, which ends as the lateral malleolus at the ankle.of  the femur. The articular surface extends laterally onto the side of  the raised medial intercondylar tubercle.\nThe superior surface of  the lateral condyle is circular \nand articulates above with the lateral condyle of  the femur. The medial edge of  this surface extends onto the side of  the lateral intercondylar tubercle.\nThe superior articular surfaces of  both the lateral and \nmedial condyles are concave, particularly centrally . The outer margins of  the surfaces are flatter and are the regions in contact with the interarticular discs (menisci) of  fibro -\ncartilage in the knee joint.\nThe nonarticular posterior surface of  the medial  \ncondyle bears a distinct horizontal groove for part of  the attachment of  the semimembranosus muscle, and the undersurface of  the lateral condyle bears a distinct  \ncircular facet for articulation with the proximal head of   \nthe fibula.\nThe intercondylar region of  the tibial plateau lies \nbetween the articular surfaces of  the medial and lateral condyles (Fig. 6.55). It is narrow centrally where it is raised to form the intercondylar eminence, the sides of  which \nare elevated further to form medial and lateral intercondy -\nlar tubercles.\nThe intercondylar region bears six distinct facets for the \nattachment of  menisci and cruciate ligaments.

All are innervated by the femoral nerve.  \nIn addition, the terminal ends of  the psoas major and iliacus muscles pass into the upper part of  the anterior compartment from sites of  origin on the posterior abdomi-nal wall. These muscles are innervated by branches directly from the anterior rami of  L1 to L3 (psoas major) or  \nfrom the femoral nerve (iliacus) as it passes down the abdominal wall.\nThe medial compartment of  the thigh  contains six \nmuscles (gracilis, pectineus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, and obturator externus). All except the pectineus, which is innervated by the femoral nerve, and part of  the adductor magnus, which is inner -\nvated by the sciatic nerve, are innervated by the obturator nerve.\nThe posterior compartment of  the thigh contains \nthree large muscles termed the \u201chamstrings.\u201d All are innervated by the sciatic nerve.The head of  the fibula is a globe-shaped expansion at \nthe proximal end of  the fibula (Fig. 6.56). A circular facet on the superomedial surface is for articulation above with a similar facet on the inferior aspect of  the lateral condyle \nof  the tibia. Just posterolateral to this facet, the bone pro -\njects superiorly as a blunt apex (styloid process).\nThe lateral surface of  the head of  the fibula bears a large \nimpression for the attachment of  the biceps femoris muscle. A depression near the upper margin of  this impression is for attachment of  the fibular collateral ligament of  the knee joint.\nThe neck of  the fibula separates the expanded head \nfrom the shaft. The common fibular nerve lies against the \nposterolateral aspect of  the neck.\nLike the tibia, the shaft of  the fibula has three borders \n(anterior, posterior, and interosseous) and three surfaces (lateral, posterior, and medial), which lie between the borders (Fig. 6.56):\n\u25a0 The anterior border is sharp midshaft and begins \nsuperiorly from the anterior aspect of  the head.\nFig. 6.57  T ransverse section through the midthigh.

At the distal end, the rectus femoris muscle converges on the quadriceps femoris tendon and inserts on the base of  the patella.\nPatellar ligament\nThe patellar ligament is functionally the continuation of  the quadriceps femoris tendon below the patella and is attached above to the apex and margins of  the patella and below to the tibial tuberosity (Fig. 6.59). The more super -\nficial fibers of  the quadriceps femoris tendon and the patel -\nlar ligament are continuous over the anterior surface of  the patella, and lateral and medial fibers are continuous with the ligament beside the margins of  the patella.\nSartorius\nThe sartorius muscle is the most superficial muscle in the \nanterior compartment of  the thigh and is a long strap-like muscle that descends obliquely through the thigh from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial surface of  the proximal shaft of  the tibia (Fig. 6.59). Its flat aponeurotic insertion into the tibia is immediately anterior to the inser -\ntion of  the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles.\nThe sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles \nattach to the tibia in a three-pronged pattern on the tibia, so their combined tendons of  insertion are often termed the pes anserinus  (Latin for \u201cgoose foot\u201d).\nIn the upper one-third of  the thigh, the medial margin \nof  the sartorius forms the lateral margin of  the femoral triangle.\nIn the middle one-third of  the thigh, the sartorius forms \nthe anterior wall of  the adductor canal.\nThe sartorius muscle assists in flexing the thigh at the \nhip joint and the leg at the knee joint. It also abducts the thigh and rotates it laterally , as when resting the foot on the opposite knee when sitting.\nThe sartorius is innervated by the femoral nerve.Vastus muscles\nThe vastus muscles originate from the femur, whereas the rectus femoris muscle originates from the pelvic bone. All attach first to the patella by the quadriceps femoris tendon and then to the tibia by the patellar ligament.\nThe vastus medialis originates from a continuous line \nof  attachment on the femur, which begins anteromedially on the intertrochanteric line and continues posteroinferi -\norly along the pectineal line and then descends along the medial lip of  the linea aspera and onto the medial supra -\ncondylar line. The fibers converge onto the medial aspect of  the quadriceps femoris tendon and the medial border of  the patella (Fig. 6.59).\nThe vastus intermedius originates mainly from the \nupper two-thirds of  the anterior and lateral surfaces of  the femur and the adjacent intermuscular septum (Fig. 6.59). It merges into the deep aspect of  the quadriceps femoris tendon and also attaches to the lateral margin of  the patella and lateral condyle of  the tibia.\nA tiny muscle (articularis genus) originates from the \nfemur just inferior to the origin of  the vastus intermedius and inserts into the suprapatellar bursa associated with the knee joint (Fig. 6.59). This articular muscle, which is often part of  the vastus intermedius muscle, pulls the bursa away from the knee joint during extension.\nThe vastus lateralis is the largest of  the vastus muscles \n(Fig. 6.59). It originates from a continuous line of  attach -\nment, which begins anterolaterally from the superior part of  the intertrochanteric line of  the femur and then circles laterally around the bone to attach to the lateral margin of  the gluteal tuberosity and continues down the upper part of  the lateral lip of  the linea aspera. Muscle fibers converge mainly onto the quadriceps femoris tendon and the lateral margin of  the patella.\nRectus femoris\nUnlike the vastus muscles, which cross only the knee joint, the rectus femoris muscle crosses both the hip and the \nknee joints (Fig. 6.59).\nThe rectus femoris has two tendinous heads of  origin \nfrom the pelvic bone:\n\u25a0 one from the anterior inf erior iliac spine ( straight \nhead), and"

The part of  the muscle that originates from the ischiopubic ramus expands laterally and inferiorly to insert on the femur along a vertical line of  attachment that extends from just inferior to the quadrate tubercle and medial to the gluteal tuberosity , along the linea aspera and onto the medial supracondylar line. This lateral part of  the muscle is often termed the \u201cadductor part\u201d of  the adductor magnus.\nThe medial part of  the adductor magnus, often called \nthe \u201chamstring part,\u201d originates from the ischial tuberosity of  the pelvic bone and descends almost vertically along the thigh to insert via a rounded tendon into the adductor tubercle on the medial condyle of  the distal head of  the femur. It also inserts via an aponeurosis up onto the medial supracondylar line. A large circular gap inferiorly between the hamstring and adductor parts of  the muscle is the adductor hiatus (Fig. 6.62), which allows the femoral artery and associated veins to pass between the adductor canal on the anteromedial aspect of  the thigh and the popliteal fossa posterior to the knee.\nThe adductor magnus adducts and medially rotates the \nthigh at the hip joint. The adductor part of  the muscle is innervated by the obturator nerve and the hamstring part is innervated by the tibial division of  the sciatic nerve.\nObturator externus\nThe obturator externus is a flat fan-shaped muscle. Its \nexpansive body is attached to the external aspect of  the Fig. 6.62  Add uctor magnus and obturator externus muscles. \nAnterior view. \nObturator externus\nAdductor magnus\n (adductor part)\nAdductor magnus\n (hamstring part)\nAdductor tubercleAdductor hiatusPerforations for\n   branches of deep   artery of thigh\n\u2022 Terminal end of\n   deep artery of thigh\nobturator membrane and adjacent bone (Fig. 6.62).

All except the short head of  the biceps femoris cross both the hip and knee joints. As a group, the hamstrings flex the leg at the knee joint and extend the thigh at the hip joint. They are also rotators at both joints.\nBiceps femoris\nThe biceps femoris muscle is lateral in the posterior \ncompartment of  the thigh and has two heads (Fig. 6.63):\n\u25a0 The long head originates with the semitendinosus \nmuscle from the inferomedial part of  the upper area of  the ischial tuberosity .\n\u25a0 The short head arises from the lateral lip of  the linea \naspera on the shaft of  the femur.\nThe muscle belly of  the long head crosses the posterior \nthigh obliquely from medial to lateral and is joined by the \nshort head distally . Together, fibers from the two heads form a tendon, which is palpable on the lateral side of  the distal thigh. The main part of  the tendon inserts into  \nthe lateral surface of  the head of  the fibula.

With increasingly severe injuries, more  \nmuscle fibers are torn and this may eventually result in a complete muscle tear. The usual muscles in the thigh that tear are the hamstring muscles. T ears in the muscles \nbelow the knee typically occur within the soleus muscle, \nthough other muscles may be affected.\nHamstring muscle injury\nInjury to the hamstring muscles is a common source of pain in athletes, particularly in those competing in sports requiring a high degree of power and speed (such as \nsprinting, track and field, football) where the hamstring \nmuscles are very susceptible to injury from excessive stretching.\nThe injury can range from a mild muscle strain to a \ncomplete tear of a muscle or a tendon. It usually occurs \nduring sudden accelerations and decelerations or rapid \nchange in direction. In adults, the most commonly injured is the muscle-tendon junction, which is a wide transition zone between the muscle and the tendon. An avulsion of \nthe ischial tuberosity with proximal hamstring origin \nattachment is common in the adolescent population, particularly during sudden hip flexion because the ischial apophysis is the weakest element of the proximal hamstring unit in this age group (Fig. 6.64). Both \nultrasound and MRI can be used to assess the hamstring \ninjury with the MRI providing not only the information about the extent of the injury but also give some indication about the prognosis (future risk of re-tear, loss of function, etc).\nFig. 6.64  Coronal MRI of the posterior pelvis and thigh \nshowing a hamstring avulsion injury. \nHamstring avulsion injury"

This disorder may be caused by stenoses (narrowing) and/or occlusions (blockages) in the \nlower aorta and the iliac, femoral, tibial, and fibular vessels. \nPatients typically have chronic leg ischemia and \u201cacute on chronic\u201d leg ischemia.\nChronic leg ischemia\nChronic leg ischemia is a disorder in which vessels have undergone atheromatous change, and often there is significant luminal narrowing (usually over 50%). Most \npatients with peripheral arterial disease have widespread \narterial disease (including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease), which may be clinically asymptomatic. Some of these patients develop such severe ischemia that the viability of the limb is threatened ( critical limb ischemia ).\nThe commonest symptom of chronic leg ischemia is \nintermittent claudication. Patients typically have a history of pain that develops in the calf muscles (usually associated with occlusions or narrowing in the femoral artery) or the \nbuttocks (usually associated with occlusion or narrowing in \nthe aorto-iliac segments). The pain experienced in these muscles is often cramplike and occurs with walking. The patient rests and is able to continue walking up to the same distance until the pain recurs and stops walking as before.\nAcute on chronic ischemia\nIn some patients with chronic limb ischemia, an acute event blocks the vessels or reduces the blood supply to such a degree that the viability of the limb is threatened.\nOccasionally a leg may become acutely ischemic with no \nevidence of underlying atheromatous disease. In these instances a blood clot is likely to have embolized from the heart. Patients with mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation are prone to embolic disease.\nCritical limb ischemia\nCritical limb ischemia occurs when the blood supply to the limb is so poor that the viability of the limb is severely threatened, and in this case many patients develop \ngangrene, ulceration, and severe rest pain in the foot. These \npatients require urgent treatment, which may be in the form of surgical reconstruction, radiological angioplasty, or even amputation.\nVeins\nVeins in the thigh consist of  superficial and deep veins. \nDeep veins generally follow the arteries and have similar names. Superficial veins are in the superficial fascia, inter -\nconnect with deep veins, and do not generally accompany arteries. The largest of  the superficial veins in the thigh is the great saphenous vein.\nGreat saphenous vein\nThe great saphenous vein originates from a venous arch on the dorsal aspect of  the foot and ascends along the medial side of  the lower limb to the proximal thigh (see  p. 560). Here it passes through the saphenous ring in deep fascia covering the anterior thigh to connect with the femoral vein in the femoral triangle (see p. 566).\nNerves\nThere are three major nerves in the thigh, each associated with one of  the three compartments. The femoral nerve is associated with the anterior compartment of  the thigh, the obturator nerve is associated with the medial compartment of  the thigh, and the sciatic nerve is associated with the posterior compartment of  the thigh."

Articular degeneration may result from an abnormal force across the joint with a normal cartilage or a \nnormal force with abnormal cartilage.\nTypically degenerative joint disease occurs in synovial \njoints and the process is called osteoarthritis. In the joints \nwhere osteoarthritis occurs the cartilage and bony tissues are usually involved, with limited change within the synovial \nmembrane. The typical findings include reduction in the \njoint space, eburnation (joint sclerosis), osteophytosis (small bony outgrowths), and bony cyst formation. As the disease progresses the joint may become malaligned, its movement \nmay become severely limited, and there may be significant \npain.\nThe commonest sites for osteoarthritis include the small \njoints of the hands and wrist, and in the lower limb, the hip and knee are typically affected, though the tarsometatarsal \nand metatarsophalangeal articulations may undergo similar \nchanges.\nThe etiology of degenerative joint disease is unclear, but \nthere are some associations, including genetic predisposition, increasing age (males tend to be affected younger than females), overuse or underuse of joints, and \nnutritional and metabolic abnormalities. Further factors \ninclude joint trauma and pre-existing articular disease or deformity.\nThe histological findings of osteoarthritis consist of \ndegenerative changes within the cartilage and the \nsubchondral bone. Further articular damage worsens these \nchanges, which promote further abnormal stresses upon the joint. As the disease progresses the typical finding is pain, which is usually worse on rising from bed and at the end of a day\u2019s activity. Commonly it is aggravated by the extremes \nof movement or unaccustomed exertion. Stiffness and \nlimitation of movement may ensue.\nTreatment in the first instance includes alteration of \nlifestyle to prevent pain and simple analgesia. As symptoms \nprogress a joint replacement may be necessary, but although \njoint replacement appears to be the panacea for degenerative joint disease, it is not without risks and complications, which include infection and failure in the short and long term.In the clinic\nCruciate ligament injuries\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is most frequently injured during non-contact activities when there is a sudden change in the direction of movement (cutting or pivoting) \n(Fig. 6.81). Contact sports may also result in ACL injury due \nto sudden twisting, hyperextension, and valgus force related to direct collision. The injury usually affects the mid-portion of the ligament and manifests itself as a complete or partial discontinuity of the fibers or abnormal orientation and \ncontour of the ligament. With an acute ACL tear, a sudden \nclick or pop can be heard and the knee becomes rapidly swollen. Several tests are used to clinically assess the injury, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI. A full \nthickness ACL tear causes instability of the knee joint. The \ntreatment depends on the desired level of activity of the patient. In those with high activity levels, surgical reconstruction of the ligament is required. Those with low activity levels may opt for knee bracing and physiotherapy; \nhowever, in the long term the internal damage to the knee \nleads to the development of early osteoarthritis.\nA tear to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) requires \nsignificant force, so it rarely occurs in isolation. It usually occurs during hyperextension of the knee or as a result of a \ndirect blow to a bent knee such as when striking the knee \nagainst the dashboard in a motor vehicle accident. Typically, the injury presents as posterior displacement of the tibia on physical examination (the so called tibial sag sign). Patients complain of knee pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, and instability. The diagnosis is confirmed on MRI. The management, as in ACL injury, depends on the degree of the injury (sprain, partial thickness, full thickness) and the level of desired activity.\nFig. 6.81  Sagittal MRI of knee joint showing rupture of the \nanterior cruciate ligament. \nACL rupture"

The history should \ninclude information about the complaint, the signs and \nsymptoms, and the patient\u2019s lifestyle (level of activity). This \nhistory may give a significant clue to the type of injury and \nthe likely findings on clinical examination, for example, if the \npatient was kicked around the medial aspect of the knee, a \nvalgus deformity injury to the tibial collateral ligament might \nbe suspected.\nThe examination should include assessment in the erect \nposition, while walking, and on the couch. The affected side \nmust be compared with the unaffected side.\nThere are many tests and techniques for examining the \nknee joint, including the following.\nTests for anterior instability\n\u25a0 Lachman\u2019s test\u2014the patient lies on the couch. The \nexaminer places one hand around the distal femur and \nthe other around the proximal tibia and then elevates the \nknee, producing 20\u00b0 of flexion. The patient\u2019s heel rests \non the couch. The examiner\u2019s thumb must be on the \ntibial tuberosity. The hand on the tibia applies a brisk \nanteriorly directed force. If the movement of the tibia on \nthe femur comes to a sudden stop, it is a firm endpoint. If \nit does not come to a sudden stop, the endpoint is \ndescribed as soft and is associated with a tear of the \nanterior cruciate ligament.\n\u25a0 Anterior drawer test\u2014a positive anterior drawer test is \nwhen the proximal head of a patient\u2019s tibia can be pulled \nanteriorly on the femur. The patient lies supine on the \ncouch. The knee is flexed to 90\u00b0 and the heel and sole of \nthe foot are placed on the couch. The examiner sits \ngently on the patient\u2019s foot, which has been placed in a \nneutral position. The index fingers are used to check that \nthe hamstrings are relaxed while the other fingers \nencircle the upper end of the tibia and pull the tibia. If \nthe tibia moves forward, the anterior cruciate ligament is \ntorn. Other peripheral structures, such as the medial \nmeniscus or meniscotibial ligaments, must also be \ndamaged to elicit this sign.\n\u25a0 Pivot shift test\u2014there are many variations of this test. \nThe patient\u2019s foot is wedged between the examiner\u2019s \nbody and elbow. The examiner places one hand flat \nunder the tibia pushing it forward with the knee in \nextension. The other hand is placed against the patient\u2019s \nthigh pushing it the other way. The lower limb is taken into slight abduction by the examiner\u2019s elbow with the \nexaminer\u2019s body acting as a fulcrum to produce the \nvalgus. The examiner maintains the anterior tibial \ntranslation and the valgus and initiates flexion of the \npatient\u2019s knee. At about 20\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 the pivot shift will occur \nas the lateral tibial plateau reduces. This test \ndemonstrates damage to the posterolateral corner of the \nknee joint and the anterior cruciate ligament.\nTests for posterior instability\n\u25a0 Posterior drawer test\u2014a positive posterior drawer test \noccurs when the proximal head of a patient\u2019s tibia can be \npushed posteriorly on the femur.

It exits the popliteal fossa superiorly to become the femoral vein by passing through the adductor hiatus.\nRoof of popliteal fossa\nThe roof  of  the popliteal fossa is covered by superficial fascia and skin (Fig. 6.83C). The most important struc -\nture in the superficial fascia is the small saphenous vein. This vessel ascends vertically in the superficial fascia on the back of  the leg from the lateral side of  the dorsal venous arch in the foot. It ascends to the back of  the knee where it penetrates deep fascia, which forms the roof  of  the popliteal fossa, and joins with the  \npopliteal vein.\nOne other structure that passes through the roof  of  the \nfossa is the posterior cutaneous nerve of  the thigh, which descends through the thigh superficial to the hamstring muscles, passes through the roof  of  the popliteal fossa, and then continues inferiorly with the small saphenous vein to innervate skin on the upper half  of  the back of   \nthe leg.Contents\nThe major contents of  the popliteal fossa are the popliteal artery , the popliteal vein, and the tibial and common fibular nerves (Fig. 6.83B).\nTibial and common fibular nerves\nThe tibial and common fibular nerves originate proximal to the popliteal fossa as the two major branches of  the sciatic nerve. They are the most superficial of  the neuro -\nvascular structures in the popliteal fossa and enter the region directly from above under the margin of  the biceps femoris muscle:\n\u25a0 The tibial ner ve descends vertically through the popli -\nteal fossa and exits deep to the margin of  the plantaris muscle to enter the posterior compartment of  the leg.\n\u25a0 The common f ibular nerve exits by following the \nbiceps femoris tendon over the lower lateral margin of  the popliteal fossa, and continues to the lateral side of  the leg where it swings around the neck of  the fibula and enters the lateral compartment of   \nthe leg.\nPopliteal artery and vein\nThe popliteal artery is the continuation of  the femoral artery in the anterior compartment of  the thigh, and begins as the femoral artery passes posteriorly through the adductor hiatus in the adductor magnus muscle.\nThe popliteal artery appears in the popliteal fossa on \nthe upper medial side under the margin of  the semimem -\nbranosus muscle. It descends obliquely through the fossa with the tibial nerve and enters the posterior compartment \nIn the clinic\nPopliteal artery aneurysm\nThe popliteal artery can become abnormally dilated, forming \nan aneurysm. The artery is considered aneurysmal when its diameter exceeds 7 mm. Although popliteal artery \naneurysms can occur in isolation, they are most commonly \nassociated with aneurysms in other large vessels such as the femoral artery or the thoracic or abdominal aorta. Therefore, once a popliteal aneurysm has been detected, the entire arterial tree needs to be investigated for the presence of \ncoexisting aneurysms elsewhere in the body.\nPopliteal artery aneurysms tend to undergo thrombosis \nand are less likely to rupture than other aneurysms. Therefore the complications are mainly related to distal \nembolization of the arterial tree and lower limb ischemia, which in the most severe cases can lead to leg amputation.\nUltrasound with duplex Doppler is the most helpful way \nof diagnosing a popliteal artery aneurysm because it can demonstrate abnormal dilation of the artery, confirm or rule out thrombus within the aneurysm, and help distinguish it from other masses of the popliteal fossa such as a synovial cyst (Baker\u2019s cyst). Popliteal artery aneurysms are usually \nrepaired surgically in view of high risk of thromboembolic \ncomplications."

The tendon curves anteriorly first under the talus and then under a shelf  of  bone (the sustentaculum tali), which projects medially from the cal -\ncaneus, and then continues anteriorly through the sole of  the foot to insert on the inferior surface of  the base of  the distal phalanx of  the great toe.Table 6.7  Deep gr oup of muscles in the posterior compartment of leg (spinal segments in bold are the major segments innervating the \nmuscle)\nMuscle Origin Insertion Innervation Function\nPopliteus Lateral femoral condyle Posterior surface of \nproximal tibiaTibial nerve (L4 to S1) Stabilizes knee joint (resists lateral rotation of tibia on femur)Unlocks knee joint (laterally rotates femur on fixed tibia)\nFlexor hallucis longusPosterior surface of fibula and adjacent interosseous membranePlantar surface of distal phalanx of great toeTibial nerve ( S2, S3) Flexes great toe\nFlexor digitorum longusMedial side of posterior surface of the tibiaPlantar surfaces of bases of distal phalanges of the lateral four toesTibial nerve ( S2, S3) Flexes lateral four toes\nTibialis posterior Posterior surfaces of interosseous membrane and adjacent regions of tibia and fibulaMainly to tuberosity of navicular and adjacent region of medial cuneiformTibial nerve (L4, L5) Inversion and plantarflexion of foot; support of medial arch of foot during walking\nThe flexor hallucis longus flexes the great toe. It is par -\nticularly active during the toe-off  phase of  walking when \nthe body is propelled forward off  the stance leg and the great toe is the last part of  the foot to leave the ground. It can also contribute to plantarflexion of  the foot at the ankle joint and is innervated by the tibial nerve.\nFlexor digitorum longus\nThe flexor digitorum longus muscle originates on the medial side of  the posterior compartment of  the leg and inserts into the lateral four digits of  the foot (Fig. 6.88). It arises mainly from the medial side of  the posterior surface of  the tibia inferior to the soleal line.\nThe flexor digitorum longus descends in the leg and \nforms a tendon, which crosses posterior to the tendon of  the tibialis posterior muscle near the ankle joint. The tendon continues inferiorly in a shallow groove behind the medial malleolus and then swings forward to enter the sole of  the foot. It crosses inferior to the tendon of  the flexor hallucis longus muscle to reach the medial side of  the foot and then divides into four tendons, which insert on the plantar surfaces of  the bases of  the distal phalanges of  digits II to V .\nThe flexor digitorum longus flexes the lateral four toes. \nIt is involved with gripping the ground during walking and propelling the body forward off  the toes at the end of  the stance phase of  gait. It is innervated by the tibial nerve.\nTibialis posterior\nThe tibialis posterior muscle originates from the interosse-ous membrane and the adjacent posterior surfaces of  the tibia and fibula (Fig. 6.88). It lies between and is overlapped by the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus muscles."

Like the tibialis anterior muscle, it also originates from deep fascia.\nThe extensor digitorum longus muscle descends to form \na tendon, which continues into the dorsal aspect of  the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which insert, via dorsal digital expansions, into the dorsal surfaces of  the bases of  the middle and distal phalanges of  the lateral  \nfour toes.\nThe extensor digitorum longus extends the toes and \ndorsiflexes the foot at the ankle joint, and is innervated by the deep fibular nerve.\nFibularis tertius\nThe fibularis tertius muscle is normally considered  \npart of  the extensor digitorum longus (Fig. 6.93). The  \nfibularis tertius originates from the medial surface of  the fibula immediately below the origin of  the extensor digito -\nrum longus muscle and the two muscles are normally connected.\nThe tendon of  the fibularis tertius descends into the foot \nwith the tendon of  the extensor digitorum longus. On the dorsal aspect of  the foot, it deviates laterally to insert into the dorsomedial surface of  the base of  metatarsal V (the metatarsal associated with the little toe).\nThe fibularis tertius assists in dorsiflexion and possibly \neversion of  the foot, and is innervated by the deep fibular \nnerve."

            "Text": "Regional Anatomy  \u2022  Foot\n6\n627In the clinic\nFootdrop\nFootdrop is an inability to dorsiflex the foot. Patients with \nfootdrop have a characteristic \u201csteppage\u201d gait. As the patient walks, the knee of the affected limb is elevated to \nan abnormal height during the swing phase to prevent the \nfoot from dragging. At the end of the swing phase, the foot \u201cslaps\u201d the ground. Also, the unaffected limb often acquires a characteristic tiptoe pattern of gait during the stance phase. A typical cause of footdrop is damage to the \ncommon fibular nerve, which may occur with fractures of \nthe fibular neck. Other causes include disc protrusion compressing the L5 nerve root, disorders of the sciatic nerve and the lumbosacral plexus, and pathologies of the \nspinal cord and brain.FOOT\nThe foot is the region of  the lower limb distal to the ankle \njoint. It is subdivided into the ankle, the metatarsus, and the digits.\nThere are five digits consisting of  the medially  \npositioned great toe (digit I) and four more laterally  \nplaced digits, ending laterally with the little toe (digit V)  \n(Fig. 6.95).\nThe foot has a superior surface ( dorsum of  foot) and \nan inferior surface ( sole; Fig. 6.95).\nAbduction and adduction of  the toes are defined with \nrespect to the long axis of  the second digit. Unlike in the hand, where the thumb is oriented 90\u00b0 to the other fingers, the great toe is oriented in the same position as the other toes. The foot is the body\u2019s point of  contact with the ground and provides a stable platform for upright stance. It also levers the body forward during walking.\nIn the clinic\nCommon fibular nerve injury\nThe common fibular nerve is susceptible to injury as it \npasses around the lateral aspect of the neck of the fibula. It can be injured as a result of a direct trauma (blow or \nlaceration), secondary to knee injury (knee dislocation), or \nas a consequence of a proximal fibular fracture. Sometimes damage to the nerve can be iatrogenic, that is, damaged during arthroscopy or knee surgery.\nSymptoms of common fibular nerve injury are often \nobserved in bed-bound patients, particularly in those with decreased levels of consciousness, due to prolonged external pressure to the knee leading to nerve compression and neuropathy. Similarly, application of a \ntight cast or a brace to the leg can compress the nerve, \nproducing symptoms of fibular muscle palsy.\nApart from a foot drop, other symptoms of common \nfibular nerve injury include loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot, and \nwasting of fibular and anterior tibial muscles."

For example, an inversion injury may fracture the medial malleolus and tear ligaments anchoring the lateral malleolus \nto the tarsal bones.\nThe ring may be disrupted not only by damage to the \nbones (which produces fractures), but also by damage to the \nligaments. Unlike bone fractures, damage to ligaments is unlikely to be appreciated on plain radiographs. When a \nfracture is noted on a plain radiograph, the physician must \nalways be aware that there may also be appreciable ligamentous disruption.Ottawa Ankle Rules\nThe Ottawa ankle rules were developed to assist clinicians in deciding whether patients with acute ankle injuries require investigation with radiographs in order to avoid unnecessary \nstudies. Named after the hospital where they were \ndeveloped, the rules are highly sensitive and have reduced the utilization of unwarranted ankle radiographs since their implementation.\nAn ankle x-ray series is required if there is ankle pain and \nany of the following:\n\u25a0 Bone t enderness along the distal 6  cm of the posterior \ntibia or tip of the medial malleolus\n\u25a0 Bone t enderness along the distal 6  cm of the posterior \nfibula or tip of the lateral malleolus\n\u25a0 Inability t o bear weight for four steps both immediately \nafter the injury and in the emergency department\nA foot x-ray series is required if there is midfoot pain and \nany of the following:\n\u25a0 Bone t enderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal  \nbone\n\u25a0 Bone t enderness at the navicular bone\n\u25a0 Inability t o bear weight for four steps both  \nimmediately after the injury and in the emergency \ndepartment\nSubtalar joint\nThe subtalar joint is between:\n\u25a0 the larg e posterior calcaneal facet on the inferior surface \nof  the talus, and\n\u25a0 the corresponding posterior talar facet on the superior \nsurface of  the calcaneus.\nThe articular cavity is enclosed by synovial membrane, \nwhich is covered by a fibrous membrane.\nThe subtalar joint allows gliding and rotation,  \nwhich are involved in inversion and eversion of  the  \nfoot.

The tarsometatarsal joints, with the transverse tarsal joint, take part in pronation and supination of  the foot.\nMetatarsophalangeal joints\nThe metatarsophalangeal joints are ellipsoid synovial joints between the sphere-shaped heads of  the metatarsals and the corresponding bases of  the proximal phalanges of  the digits.\nThe metatarsophalangeal joints allow extension and \nflexion, and limited abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction.\nThe joint capsules are reinforced by medial and lateral \ncollateral ligaments, and by plantar ligaments, which \nhave grooves on their plantar surfaces for the long tendons of  the digits (Fig. 6.109).Deep transverse metatarsal ligaments\nFour deep transverse metatarsal ligaments link the \nheads of  the metatarsals together and enable the metatar -\nsals to act as a single unified structure (Fig. 6.109). The ligaments blend with the plantar ligaments of  the adjacent metatarsophalangeal joints.\nThe metatarsal of  the great toe is oriented in the same \nplane as the metatarsals of  the other toes and is linked to the metatarsal of  the second toe by a deep transverse metatarsal ligament. In addition, the joint between the metatarsal of  the great toe and medial cuneiform has a limited range of  motion. The great toe therefore has a very restricted independent function\u2014unlike the thumb in the hand, where the metacarpal is oriented 90\u00b0 to the meta -\ncarpals of  the fingers, there is no deep transverse metacar -\npal ligament between the metacarpals of  the thumb and index finger, and the joint between the metacarpal and carpal bone allows a wide range of  motion.\nIn the clinic\nBunions\nA bunion occurs on the medial aspect of the first \nmetatarsophalangeal joint. This is an extremely important area of the foot because it is crossed by tendons and \nligaments, which transmit and distribute the body\u2019s weight \nduring movement. It is postulated that abnormal stresses in this region of the joint may produce the bunion deformity.\nClinically, a bunion is a significant protuberance of bone \nthat may include soft tissue around the medial aspect of the \nfirst metatarsophalangeal joint. As it progresses, the toe \nappears to move toward the smaller toes, producing crowding of the digits.This deformity tends to occur among people who wear \nhigh-heeled or pointed shoes, but osteoporosis and a \nhereditary predisposition are also risk factors.\nTypically the patient\u2019s symptoms are pain, swelling, and \ninflammation. The bunion tends to enlarge and may cause \nproblems in obtaining appropriate footwear.\nInitial treatment is by adding padding to shoes, changing \nthe type of footwear used, and taking anti-inflammatory drugs. Some patients may need surgery to correct the deformity and realign the toe."

It runs from the calcaneal tuberosity to the base of the toes. Overuse \nand increased strain on the plantar aponeurosis, such as \nexcessive running and standing, and increased body weight, can lead to micro-tears and degeneration within the aponeurosis at the heel with disorganization of the collagen fibers. Patients typically present with mild to \nsevere heel pain, which appears thickened on imaging \n(Fig. 6.121). It is usually successfully treated with intense physiotherapy, but may require image-guided injection therapies. In severe cases, the diseased section of the \nfascia needs to be surgically removed.\nFig. 6.121  MRI of posterior foot in a patient with plantar \nfasciitis shows thickening of the plantar aponeurosis at the \ncalcaneal insertion and a calcaneal spur. \nPlantar fasciitisLumbricals\nThe lumbrical muscles are four worm-like muscles that \noriginate from the tendons of  the flexor digitorum longus and pass dorsally to insert into the free medial margins of  the extensor hoods of  the four lateral toes (Fig. 6.120).\nThe first lumbrical originates from the medial side of  the \ntendon of  the flexor digitorum longus that is associated with the second toe. The remaining three muscles are bipennate and originate from the sides of  adjacent tendons.\nThe lumbrical muscles act through the extensor hoods \nto resist excessive extension of  the metatarsophalangeal joints and flexion of  the interphalangeal joints when the heel leaves the ground during walking.\nThe first lumbrical is innervated by the medial plantar \nnerve, while the other three are innervated by the lateral plantar nerve.\nThird layer\nThere are three muscles in the third layer in the sole of  the foot (Fig. 6.122 and Table 6.13):\n\u25a0 Tw o (the flexor hallucis brevis and adductor hallucis) \nare associated with the great toe.\n\u25a0 The third (the flexor digiti minimi brevis) is associated \nwith the little toe.\nFlexor hallucis brevis\nThe flexor hallucis brevis muscle has two tendinous \nheads of  origin (Fig. 6.122):\n\u25a0 The lateral head originates from the plantar surfaces \nof  the cuboid, behind the groove for the fibularis longus, and adjacent surface of  the lateral cuneiform.\n\u25a0 The medial head originates from the tendon of  the \ntibialis posterior muscle as it passes into the sole of   \nthe foot.\nThe medial and lateral heads unite and give rise to a \nmuscle belly , which itself  is separated into medial and \nlateral parts adjacent to the plantar surface of  metatarsal I. Each part of  the muscle gives rise to a tendon that inserts on either the lateral or medial side of  the base of  the proxi -\nmal phalanx of  the great toe.\nA sesamoid bone occurs in each tendon of  the flexor \nhallucis brevis as it crosses the plantar surface of  the head of  metatarsal I. The tendon of  the flexor hallucis longus passes between the sesamoid bones.\nThe flexor hallucis brevis flexes the metatarsophalan-\ngeal joint of  the great toe and is innervated by the medial plantar nerve.The quadratus plantae muscle inserts into the lateral \nside of  the tendon of  the flexor digitorum longus in the proximal half  of  the sole of  the foot near where the tendon divides.\nThe quadratus plantae assists the flexor digitorum \nlongus tendon in flexing the toes and may also adjust the \u201cline of  pull\u201d of  this tendon as it enters the sole of  the foot from the medial side.

In this region of the foot the lateral \nplantar nerve often unites with the medial plantar nerve. \nAs the two nerves join, the resulting nerve is typically larger in diameter than those of the other toes. Also, it is in a relatively subcutaneous position, just above the fat pad of the foot close to the artery and the vein. Above \nthe nerve is the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, \nwhich is a broad strong structure holding the metatarsals together. Typically, as the patient enters the \u201cpush-off\u201d phase of walking the interdigital nerve is sandwiched \nbetween the ground and the deep transverse metatarsal \nligament. The forces tend to compress the common plantar nerve, which can be irritated, in which case there is usually some associated inflammatory change and thickening.\nTypically, patients experience pain in the third \ninterspace, which may be sharp or dull and is usually worsened by wearing shoes and walking.\nTreatment may include injection of anti-inflammatory \ndrugs, or it may be necessary to surgically remove the \nlesion.\nFig. 6.128  A.Terminal branches of superficial and deep fibular \nnerves in the right foot.

While racing a friend he caught an inner edge of his right ski. He lost his balance and fell. \nDuring his tumble he heard an audible \u201cclick.\u201d After \nrecovering from his spill, he developed tremendous pain in his right knee. He was unable to carry on skiing for that day, and by the time he returned to his chalet, his knee was significantly swollen. He went immediately to see an \northopedic surgeon.\nThe orthopedic surgeon carefully reviewed the mechanism \nof injury.\nThe man was skiing down the slope with both skis in \nparallel. The ankles were held rigid in the boots and the \nknees were slightly flexed. A momentary loss of concentration led to the skier catching the inner edge of his right ski. This effect was to force the boot and calf into \nexternal rotation. Furthermore, the knee was forced into a \nvalgus position (bowed laterally away from the midline) and the skier tumbled. Both skis were detached from the boots as the bindings released them.A series of structures within the knee joint were damaged sequentially.\nAs the knee went into external rotation and valgus, the \nanterior cruciate ligament became taut, acting as a fulcrum. The tibial collateral ligament was stressed and the lateral compartment of the knee compressed. As the force increased, the tibial collateral ligament was torn (Fig. \n6.139A,B), as was the medial meniscus (Fig. 6.140C). Finally, \nthe anterior cruciate ligament, which was taut, gave way (Fig. 6.140A,B).\nThe joint became swollen some hours afterward.\nDisruption of the anterior cruciate ligament characteristically \nproduces marked joint swelling. The ligament is extrasynovial and intracapsular and has a rich blood supply. As the ligament was torn it ruptured into the joint. Blood from the tear irritates the synovial membrane and also \nenters the joint. These factors produce gradual swelling of \nthe joint over the ensuing hours with significant fluid accumulation in the joint cavity.\nThe patient had a surgical reconstruction of the anterior \ncruciate ligament.\nFig. 6.139  A.

The rest of \nher leg was otherwise unremarkable.\nA diagnosis of varicose veins was made and the surgeon \nneeded to determine the site of valvular incompetence.\nThere are typical points where incompetent valves occur \nbetween the superficial and the deep veins. In these regions \nthe varicosities tend to become marked. The typical sites \nare:\n\u25a0 at the saphena varix\u2014the saphenofemoral junction \nwhere the femoral vein is joined by the great saphenous \nvein;\n\u25a0 in the midthigh perforating vein between the great \nsaphenous vein and the femoral vein;\n\u25a0 in the calf the three sites where perforators occur, 5, 10, \nand 15 cm above the medial malleolus between the great \nsaphenous vein and the deep veins of the calf; and\n\u25a0 at the junction of the small saphenous vein and the \npopliteal vein.\nThe surgeon asked the patient to lie supine on the bed and \nelevated the leg. A tourniquet was placed around the upper \nthigh below the saphenofemoral junction and the patient \nwas asked to stand up. No veins were demonstrated filling \non the medial aspect of the thigh and lower limb.\nThe effect of the tourniquet is to compress the great \nsaphenous vein while permitting blood to flow in the deep \nvenous system of the femoral vein and the deep femoral \nvein.\nBecause there was no filling of the medial varicose veins \nbelow the level of the tourniquet, the surgeon assumed that \nthe valve at the saphenofemoral junction was incompetent \nand would require surgical treatment.However, during the tourniquet maneuver the surgeon also \nnoted some veins around the posterior and posterolateral \naspect of the calf.\nA similar technique was performed by application of a \ntourniquet just below the level of the knee joint while the \nleg was elevated. The patient stood up and no veins were \ndemonstrated filling in the posterior and posterolateral \naspect of the calf. These findings suggested to the surgeon \nthat there was also incompetence of the valve for the small \nsaphenous system where it anastomoses with the popliteal \nvein.\nSurgery was planned.\nA small transverse incision was made below the level of the \ninguinal ligament where the great saphenous vein passes \nthrough the saphenous ring in the deep fascia. This can be \neasily palpated as a small circular defect in the fascia. The \nsaphenofemoral junction was identified and the great \nsaphenous vein was ligated, at its anastomosis with the \nfemoral vein. The great saphenous vein was stripped using \nspecial surgical techniques and removed.\nThe patient was placed prone for the second part of the \noperation.\nA small incision was made transversely at the level of the \nskin crease in the popliteal fossa. However, the surgeon had \ndifficulty identifying the junction between the small \nsaphenous vein and the popliteal vein. After considerable \ntime the surgeon located what he thought was the small \nsaphenous vein and the structure was ligated and the \nwound closed.\nThe following day the patient was sent home, but returned \nto the clinic after 2 weeks complaining of problems walking. \nOn examination there was absence of dorsiflexion, a \nsensory disturbance over the lateral aspect of the leg and \n(continues)"

She complained of a severe pain in \nher right hip and had noticeable bruising on the right side \nof the face.\nOn admission it was noted that the patient\u2019s right leg was \nshorter than her left leg and externally rotated.\nAn initial series of investigations was carried out, including a \nplain radiograph of the pelvis.\nThe plain radiograph of the pelvis demonstrated a displaced \nfracture through the right neck of the femur.\nThe apparent shortening and external rotation of the leg on \nclinical examination were accounted for by spasm of the \nmuscles connecting the pelvis to the trochanters and \nproximal femur. Of the muscles that surround the hip joint \nthe largest group is the adductor group (adductor longus, \nbrevis, and magnus) and the psoas major. The psoas major \ninserts onto the lesser trochanter and its action is to \nexternally rotate and flex the hip. The fulcrum of action of \nthe psoas major is the femoral head in the acetabulum. \nHowever, when the femoral neck is detached its overriding \naction pulls the femur proximally and into external rotation. \nThe external rotation is exacerbated by the spasm in the \nadductor muscles.\nExtensive medical testing was necessary before surgery. It is \nimportant to remember that elderly patients may have a \nnumber of coexisting diseases.\nThe patient then underwent a hemiarthroplasty.\nHemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure in which the \nfemoral head is removed from the acetabulum. The femoral \nneck is trimmed close to the trochanters and the medullary \ncavity of the femoral shaft is reamed. A metal hip prosthesis is inserted into the medullary cavity of the femur and the \nhead of the prosthesis is placed into the acetabulum, in \nwhich it articulates. Importantly, the acetabulum is not \nreplaced in straightforward cases, though a prosthetic \nacetabulum may be inserted if clinically appropriate.\nAn arthroplasty was the only procedure that could be \nperformed.\nThe blood supply to the femoral head is from three \nsources\u2014the artery within the ligament of the head of the \nfemur, vessels in the medullary cavity, and vessels deep to \nthe synovium running in the retinacula of the fibrous capsule \nof the hip joint. With increasing age, the medullary cavity \nundergoes fatty replacement of the normal red marrow, thus \nattenuating the medullary blood supply. The artery within \nthe ligament of the head of the femur also becomes \nattenuated and this is often associated with atherosclerotic \narterial disease.\nUnfortunately for this patient, the sole blood supply to the \nhead of the femur was via the vessels in the retinacula \nfibers, which were transected at the time of the fracture. If \nthe patient had an intertrochanteric fracture instead, the \nvessels of the retinacula fibers would not have been \ndamaged and a different approach to surgical fixation could \nbe undertaken without the need for a hemiarthroplasty.\nThe patient has osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is a common condition affecting older people, \nbut is significantly more frequent in postmenopausal \nwomen. Many fractures of the femoral neck in elderly \npatients occur because the strength of the bone is \nsignificantly reduced when it is osteoporotic. Other common \nsites for osteoporotic fractures include the distal radius and \nthe thoracic and lumbar vertebrae."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any \nconcerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did \ncomplain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths.\nThe family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the \nleft leg venous system.\nUltrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate \nflow and occlusion of arteries and veins.\nThe probe was placed over the left femoral vein and no flow \nwas demonstrated. Furthermore, the vein could not be compressed, and no alteration of flow with breathing could be demonstrated. Some flow was demonstrated in the deep \nfemoral vein and in the great saphenous vein. No flow was \ndemonstrated throughout the length of the left femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the tibial veins.\nThe technician scanned the opposite side, where excellent \nflow was demonstrated within the right femoral venous \nsystem. In addition, when the calf was gently massaged an augmentation to the flow was noted. It was possible to demonstrate alteration of flow with respiratory excursion and venous compression was satisfactory. A diagnosis of \nextensive left-sided deep vein thrombosis was made.\nCertain patients are more prone to deep vein thrombosis.Three major factors predispose a patient to thrombosis:\n\u25a0 r educed or stagnant blood flow in the veins\u2014significant \nstasis of blood (which may be due to lack of movement), \nreduced muscular calf pump effect, and obstruction to flow may occur;\n\u25a0 injury t o the vein wall\u2014venous trauma may damage the \nvessel walls, promoting thrombus formation;\n\u25a0 hyper coagulability of the blood\u2014hypercoagulable states \nare often associated with abnormal levels of certain clotting factors, such as antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S.\nIn this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by \nthe gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to \nthe deep vein thrombosis.\nThe chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli.\nSmall emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the \nthrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the \nprecursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus \n(eFig. 6.143).\nAnticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an \nuneventful delivery.\neFig. 6.143  Pulmonar y embolus.

The mass measured approximately 4  cm in \ntransverse diameter. The patient was otherwise fit and well \nand had no other history of note.\nThe mass was arising from one of the structures in the \npopliteal fossa.\nWithin the popliteal fossa there is a neurovascular bundle \nthat contains the sciatic nerve (and its two divisions), the \npopliteal artery and the popliteal vein. There are also \nnumerous small bursae associated with the posterior aspect \nof the knee joint and the muscles and tendons in this \nregion. It is possible that this mass is arising from the \nposterior structures of the knee joint, which include synovial \noutpouchings, the menisci, and the muscles and tendons of \nthis region.\nThe commonest masses demonstrated within the popliteal \nfossa are a popliteal cyst, a popliteal aneurysm, and an \narterial adventitial cyst.\nFurther clinical examination revealed that this mass was \npulsatile and demonstrated a bruit (an audible rumbling \nmade by turbulent blood flow) on auscultation.\nA diagnosis of popliteal artery aneurysm was made.\nA popliteal artery aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of the \npopliteal artery. It is unusual for it to be greater than 5 cm \nbecause symptoms usually develop before it reaches this \nsize.Unlike aneurysms elsewhere in the body, the natural history \nof popliteal aneurysms is to embolize, with the mural \nthrombus producing ischemia distal to the lesion, rather than \nrupture. It is mandatory to examine the rest of the arterial \ntree in patients with a popliteal aneurysm because \naneurysms may be bilateral and there is an association with \nabdominal aortic aneurysms.\nThe other diagnostic possibilities include a popliteal cyst and \nan adventitial cyst.\nA popliteal cyst (Baker\u2019s cyst) is a synovial outpouching that \narises from the posteromedial aspect of the knee joint. The \nsynovial membrane of the knee joint outpouches between \nthe medial head of the gastrocnemius and the \nsemimembranosus tendon to lie medially within the \npopliteal fossa. Occasionally it tracks inferiorly to lie in and \naround the tendons that form the pes anserinus (sartorius, \ngracilis, and semitendinosus).\nAn arterial adventitial cyst is an uncommon cystic structure \nthat arises from the wall of the artery.\nAn ultrasound investigation was carried out.\nUsing real-time ultrasound the dimensions of the popliteal \naneurysm were characterized and the flow in the vessels \nwas demonstrated. Furthermore, a popliteal cyst and \nadventitial cyst were completely excluded.\nThe patient underwent a surgical excision and graft \ninterposition and has made an uneventful recovery."

This injury occurred directly after accidentally running into a \npothole in the pavement.\nA fractured ankle was suspected.Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the ankle \nrevealed no evidence of any bone injury to account for the \npatient\u2019s soft tissue swelling.\nThe patient was given a pair of crutches and analgesics and \ntold to rest. A diagnosis of a simple sprain was made.\nOver the ensuing weeks the swelling and edema within the \nsoft tissue of the ankle decreased and the patient began to \nrun, but noted that the ankle kept \u201cgiving way.\u201d She went to \nan orthopedic surgeon for further assessment.\nThere was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint.\nAt this stage it is important to review the mechanism of \ninjury. Typically when running on a hard surface the final phase of push-off involves supination of the foot. If the foot is caught in a pothole or divot, this supinating maneuver \ncontinues and inverts the ankle joint in plantarflexion. This \nputs significant strain on the lateral ligament complex and, given the appropriate circumstances, disruption (in order) of the ligament structures occurs from anterior to posterior. First, the anterior talofibular ligament is disrupted, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament, and then the posterior talofibular ligament. As each of these ligaments is disrupted, \nthe severity of the soft tissue injury is significantly enhanced \nand the chance of permanent ankle instability is increased.\nOn examination any positive anterior drawer test of the \nankle (4\u20135  mm compared to the opposite side) suggests an \ninjury to the anterior talofibular ligament.The anterior talofibular ligament can be assessed by placing \nthe foot in marked plantarflexion. If there is over 10\u00b0 of \ndifference between the affected foot and nonaffected foot, an anterior talofibular ligament disruption is suspected.\nIt is extremely rare for all three ligaments to be disrupted, \nand if so there are usually other significant ankle injuries.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out to assess \nligament damage.\nMRI is excellent for demonstrating the medial and lateral \nligament complexes of the ankle as well as the soft tissues \nthat support the bones of the posterior foot.\nUnfortunately for this patient there was a tear of the anterior \ntalofibular ligament (eFig. 6.145), which had to be repaired surgically.\n(continues)"

            "Text": "Regional Anatomy  \u2022  Shoulder\n 7\n693In the clinic\nFracture of the proximal humerus\nIt is extremely rare for fractures to occur across the \nanatomical neck of the humerus because the obliquity of such a fracture would have to traverse the thickest region \nof bone. Typically fractures occur around the surgical neck \nof the humerus. Although the axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery may be damaged with this type of fracture, this rarely happens. It is important that the axillary nerve is tested before relocation to be sure  \nthat the injury has not damaged the nerve and that  \nthe treatment itself does not cause a neurological  \ndeficit.\nJoints\nThe three joints in the shoulder complex are the sternocla -\nvicular, acromioclavicular, and glenohumeral joints.\nThe sternoclavicular joint and the acromioclavicular \njoint link the two bones of  the pectoral girdle to each other \nand to the trunk. The combined movements at these two joints enable the scapula to be positioned over a wide range on the thoracic wall, substantially increasing \u201creach\u201d by the upper limb.Roughenings on the lateral and medial lips and on the \nfloor of  the intertubercular sulcus mark sites for the attachment of  the pectoralis major, teres major, and latis -\nsimus dorsi muscles, respectively .\nThe lateral lip of  the intertubercular sulcus is continu -\nous inferiorly with a large V-shaped deltoid tuberosity \non the lateral surface of  the humerus midway along its length (Fig. 7.22), which is where the deltoid muscle inserts onto the humerus.\nIn approximately the same position, but on the medial \nsurface of  the bone, there is a thin vertical roughening for attachment of  the coracobrachialis muscle.\nSurgical neck\nOne of  the most important features of  the proximal end of  the humerus is the surgical neck (Fig. 7.22). This region \nis oriented in the horizontal plane between the expanded proximal part of  the humerus (head, anatomical neck, and tubercles) and the narrower shaft. The axillary nerve and the posterior circumflex humeral artery , which pass into the deltoid region from the axilla, do so immediately poste -\nrior to the surgical neck. Because the surgical neck is weaker than more proximal regions of  the bone, it is one of  the sites where the humerus commonly fractures. The associated nerve (axillary) and artery (posterior circumflex humeral) can be damaged by fractures in this region.The glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) is the articula -\ntion between the humerus of  the arm and the scapula.\nSternoclavicular joint\nThe sternoclavicular joint occurs between the proximal end of  the clavicle and the clavicular notch of  the manu-\nbrium of  the sternum  together with a small part of  the \nfirst costal cartilage (Fig. 7.23). It is synovial and saddle shaped. The articular cavity is completely separated into two compartments by an articular disc. The sternoclavicu -\nlar joint allows movement of  the clavicle, predominantly in the anteroposterior and vertical planes, although some rotation also occurs.\nThe sternoclavicular joint is surrounded by a joint \ncapsule and is reinforced by four ligaments:\n\u25a0 The anterior and posterior sternoclavicular liga-\nments are anterior and posterior, respectively , to the joint.\nFig. 7.23  St ernoclavicular joint.

The relatively small bony glenoid cavity, supplemented by  \nthe less robust fibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum and the ligamentous support, make it susceptible to dislocation.\nAnterior dislocation (Fig. 7.32) occurs most frequently and \nis usually associated with an isolated traumatic incident (clinically, all anterior dislocations are anteroinferior). In some \ncases, the anteroinferior glenoid labrum is torn with or \nwithout a small bony fragment. Once the joint capsule and cartilage are disrupted, the joint is susceptible to further (recurrent) dislocations. When an anteroinferior dislocation \noccurs, the axillary nerve may be injured by direct \ncompression of the humeral head on the nerve inferiorly as it passes through the quadrangular space. Furthermore, the \u201clengthening\u201d effect of the humerus may stretch the radial nerve, which is tightly bound within the radial groove, and \nproduce a radial nerve paralysis. Occasionally, an \nanteroinferior dislocation is associated with a fracture, which may require surgical reduction.\nPosterior dislocation is extremely rare; when seen, the \nclinician should focus on its cause, the most common being \nextremely vigorous muscle contractions, which may be \nassociated with an epileptic seizure caused by electrocution. Treatment of recurrent instability can be challenging. The aims of treatment are to maintain function and range of movement while preventing instability (subluxation, \ndislocation, and the \u201cfeeling\u201d of dislocation). This can be \nachieved through physical therapy and shoulder \u201cre-education.\u201d If this fails, capsular tightening and stabilization of the labrum can be achieved arthroscopically. If the problem persists, the coracoid process can be divided at the base, maintaining continuity of the muscular \nattachments. The process is transferred and a screw fixed to \nthe anterior inferior border of the glenoid to form a buttress to prevent future dislocations.\nFig. 7.32  Radiograph showing an ant eroinferior dislocation of \nthe shoulder joint. \nAcromionGlenoid cavity\nClavicle\nHead of humerus"

The muscle most commonly involved is supraspinatus as it passes beneath the acromion and the \nacromioclavicular ligament. This space, beneath which the \nsupraspinatus tendon passes, is of fixed dimensions. Swelling of the supraspinatus muscle, excessive fluid within the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, or subacromial bony spurs may produce significant impingement when the arm is \nabducted.\nThe blood supply to the supraspinatus tendon is relatively \npoor. Repeated trauma, in certain circumstances, makes the \ntendon susceptible to degenerative change, which may \nresult in calcium deposition, producing extreme pain. The \ncalcium deposits can be extracted through a needle under image guidance and often have the consistency of toothpaste.\nWhen the supraspinatus tendon has undergone significant \ndegenerative change, it is more susceptible to trauma, and partial- or full-thickness tears may develop (Fig. 7.33). These tears are most common in older patients and may result in considerable difficulty in carrying out normal activities of daily living such as combing hair.

The accessory nerve can be evalu -\nated by testing the function of  the trapezius muscle. This is most easily done by asking patients to shrug their shoulders against resistance.\nDeltoid\nThe deltoid  muscle is large and triangular in shape, \nwith its base attached to the scapula and clavicle and its apex attached to the humerus (Fig. 7.36). It origi -\nnates along a continuous U-shaped line of  attachment \nto the clavicle and the scapula, mirroring the adjacent insertion sites of  the trapezius muscle. It inserts into the deltoid tuberosity on the lateral surface of  the shaft of  the  \nhumerus.\nThe major function of  the deltoid muscle is abduction \nof  the arm.\nThe deltoid muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve, \nwhich is a branch of  the posterior cord of  the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve and associated blood vessels (the posterior circumflex humeral artery and vein) enter the deltoid by passing posteriorly around the surgical neck of  the humerus.\nLevator scapulae\nThe levator scapulae originates from the transverse proc -\nesses of  CI to CIV vertebrae (Fig. 7.36).

The scapula, acromion, and clavicle can be \npalpated between the attachments of  the trapezius and deltoid.\nDeep to the trapezius the scapula is attached to the \nvertebral column by three muscles\u2014the levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major. These three muscles work with the trapezius (and with muscles found anteri -\norly) to position the scapula on the trunk.\nTrapezius\nThe trapezius muscle has an extensive origin from the \naxial skeleton, which includes sites on the skull and the vertebrae, from CI to TXII (Fig. 7.36). From CI to CVII,  \nthe muscle attaches to the vertebrae through the liga -\nmentum nuchae. The muscle inserts onto the skeletal framework of  the shoulder along the inner margins of  a continuous U-shaped line of  attachment oriented in the \nhorizontal plane, with the bottom of  the U directed laterally . \nTogether, the left and right trapezius muscles form a diamond or trapezoid shape, from which the name is derived.\nThe trapezius muscle is a powerful elevator of  the  \nshoulder and also rotates the scapula to extend the reach superiorly .\nInnervation of  the trapezius muscle is by the accessory \nnerve [XI] and the anterior rami of  cervical nerves C3 and Table 7.1  Muscles o f the shoulder (spinal segments in bold are the major segments innervating the muscle)\nMuscle Origin Insertion Innervation Function\nTrapezius Superior nuchal line, external \noccipital protuberance, medial margin of the ligamentum nuchae, spinous processes  \nof CVII to TXII and the related supraspinous ligamentsSuperior edge of the crest of the spine of the scapula, acromion, posterior border of lateral one-third of clavicleMotor spinal part of accessory nerve (XI).

This broad cord-like muscle passes \nsuperiorly and laterally and ends as a flat tendon that attaches to the medial lip of  the intertubercular sulcus on the anterior surface of  the humerus. The teres major medi-ally rotates and extends the humerus.\nLong head of triceps brachii\nThe long head of  the triceps brachii  muscle originates \nfrom the infraglenoid tubercle and passes somewhat  \nvertically down the arm to insert, with the medial and lateral heads of  this muscle, on the olecranon of  the ulna (Fig. 7.37).\nThe triceps brachii is the primary extensor of  the \nforearm at the elbow joint. Because the long head crosses the glenohumeral joint, it can also extend and adduct the humerus.\nThe importance of  the triceps brachii in the posterior \nscapular region is that its vertical course between the teres minor and teres major, together with these muscles and the humerus, forms spaces through which nerves and vessels pass between regions.\nGateways to the posterior scapular region\nSuprascapular foramen\nThe suprascapular foramen is the route through which structures pass between the base of  the neck and the pos -\nterior scapular region (Fig. 7.37).

They form tendons that insert on the greater tubercle of  the humerus.\n\u25a0 The tendon of  the supraspinatus passes under the \nacromion, where it is separated from the bone by a subacromial bursa, passes over the glenohumeral joint, and inserts on the superior facet of  the greater tubercle.\n\u25a0 The tendon of  the infraspinatus passes posteriorly to the \nglenohumeral joint and inserts on the middle facet of  the greater tubercle.\nThe supraspinatus participates in abduction of  the arm. \nThe infraspinatus laterally rotates the humerus.\nTeres minor and teres major\nThe teres minor muscle is a cord-like muscle that origi -\nnates from a flattened area of  the scapula immediately \nadjacent to its lateral border below the infraglenoid  \ntubercle (Fig. 7.37).

Tributaries of  the axillary vein generally follow the branches of  the axillary artery . Other tributaries include brachial veins that follow the brachial artery and the cephalic vein.The cephalic vein is a superficial vein that drains the \nlateral and posterior parts of  the hand, the forearm, and the arm. In the area of  the shoulder, it passes into an inverted triangular cleft (the clavipectoral triangle) between the deltoid muscle, pectoralis major muscle, and clavicle. In the superior part of  the clavipectoral triangle, the cephalic vein passes deep to the clavicular head of  the pectoralis major muscle and pierces the clavipectoral fascia to join the axillary vein. Many patients who are critically ill have lost blood or fluid, which requires replacement. Access to a peripheral vein is necessary to replace the fluid. The typical sites for venous access are the cephalic vein  \nin the hand or veins that lie within the superficial tissues of  the cubital fossa."

            "Text": "Upper Limb\n726\nIn the clinic\nTrauma to the arteries of the upper limb\nThe arterial supply to the upper limb is particularly \nsusceptible to trauma in places where it is relatively fixed \nor in a subcutaneous position.\nFracture of rib I\nAs the subclavian artery passes out of the neck and into \nthe axilla, it is fixed in position by the surrounding \nmuscles to the superior surface of rib I. A rapid \ndeceleration injury involving upper thoracic trauma may \ncause a first rib fracture, which may significantly \ncompromise the distal part of the subclavian artery or the \nfirst part of the axillary artery. Fortunately, there are \nanastomotic connections between branches of the \nsubclavian artery and the axillary artery, which form  \na network around the scapula and proximal end of the \nhumerus; therefore, even with complete vessel \ntransection, the arm is rarely rendered completely \nischemic (ischemia is poor blood supply to an organ  \nor a limb).\nAnterior dislocation of the humeral head\nAnterior dislocation of the humeral head may compress \nthe axillary artery, resulting in vessel occlusion. This is \nunlikely to render the upper limb completely ischemic, but \nit may be necessary to surgically reconstruct the axillary \nartery to obtain pain-free function. Importantly, the axillary \nartery is intimately related to the brachial plexus, which \nmay be damaged at the time of anterior dislocation.In the clinic\nSubclavian/axillary venous access\nThere are a number of routes through which central \nvenous access may be obtained. The \u201csubclavian route\u201d \nand the jugular routes are commonly used by clinicians. \nThe subclavian route is a misnomer that remains the \npreferred term in clinical practice. In fact, most clinicians \nenter the first part of the axillary vein.\nThere are a number of patients that undergo \ncatheterization of the subclavian vein/axillary vein. \nEntering the subclavian vein/axillary vein is a relatively \nstraightforward technique. The clavicle is identified and a \nsharp needle is placed in the infraclavicular region, aiming \nsuperomedially. When venous blood is aspirated, access \nhas been obtained. This route is popular for long-term \nvenous access, such as Hickman lines, and for \nshorter-term access where multiple-lumen catheters are \ninserted (e.g., intensive care unit). \nThe subclavian vein/axillary vein is also the preferred \nsite for insertion of pacemaker wires. There is, however, a \npreferred point of entry into the vein to prevent \ncomplications. The vein should be punctured in the \nmidclavicular line or lateral to this line. The reason for this \npuncture site is the course of the vein and its relationship \nto other structures. The vein passes anterior to the artery, \nsuperior to the first rib, and inferior to the clavicle as it \ncourses toward the thoracic inlet. Beneath the clavicle is \nsituated the subclavius muscle. Should the puncture of the \nvein enter where the subclavius muscle is related to the \naxillary vein, the catheter or wire may become kinked at \nthis point. Moreover, the constant contraction and \nrelaxation of this muscle will induce fatigue in the line and \nwire, which may ultimately lead to fracture. A fractured \npacemaker wire or a rupture in a chemotherapy catheter \ncan have severe consequences for the patient.In the clinic\nImaging the blood supply to the upper limb\nWhen there is clinical evidence of vascular compromise to \nthe upper limb, or vessels are needed to form an \narteriovenous fistula (which is necessary for renal dialysis), \nimaging is required to assess the vessels.\nUltrasound is a useful tool for carrying out a noninvasive \nassessment of the vessels of the upper limb from the third \npart of the subclavian artery to the deep and superficial \npalmar arteries. Blood flow can be quantified and anatomical \nvariants can be noted.Angiography is carried out in certain cases. The femoral \nartery is punctured below the inguinal ligament and a long \ncatheter is placed through the iliac arteries and around the \narch of the aorta to enter either the left subclavian artery or \nthe brachiocephalic trunk and then the right subclavian \nartery. Radiopaque contrast agents are injected into the \nvessel and radiographs are obtained as the contrast agents \npass first through the arteries, then the capillaries, and \nfinally the veins."

It passes laterally to penetrate the coracobrachialis muscle and pass between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles in the arm, and inner -\nvates all three flexor muscles in the anterior compart-ment of  the arm, terminating as the lateral cutaneous \nnerve of  the forearm .\n\u25a0 The lateral root of  the median nerve  is the largest \nterminal branch of  the lateral cord and passes medially to join a similar branch from the medial cord to form the median nerve (Fig. 7.55).\nBranches of the medial cord\nThe medial cord has five branches (Fig. 7.55).\n\u25a0 The medial pectoral nerve is the most proximal \nbranch. It receives a communicating branch from the lateral pectoral nerve and then passes anteriorly between the axillary artery and axillary vein. Branches of  the nerve penetrate and supply the pectoralis minor muscle. Some of  these branches pass through the muscle to reach and supply the pectoralis major muscle. Other branches occasionally pass around the inferior or lateral margin of  the pectoralis minor muscle to reach the pectoralis major muscle.\n\u25a0 The medial cutaneous nerve of  the arm (medial \nbrachial cutaneous nerve) passes through the axilla and into the arm where it penetrates deep fascia and supplies skin over the medial side of  the distal third of  the arm. In the axilla, the nerve communicates with the intercostobrachial nerve of  T2. Fibers of  the medial cutaneous nerve of  the arm innervate the upper part of  the medial surface of  the arm and floor of  the axilla.\n\u25a0 The medial cutaneous nerve of  the forearm \n(medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve) originates \njust distal to the origin of  the medial cutaneous nerve of  the arm. It passes out of  the axilla and into the arm where it gives off  a branch to the skin over the biceps brachii muscle, and then continues down the arm to penetrate the deep fascia with the basilic vein, continu -\ning inferiorly to supply the skin over the anterior surface of  the forearm. It innervates skin over the medial surface of  the forearm down to the wrist.\n\u25a0 The medial root of  the median nerve  passes laterally \nto join with a similar root from the lateral cord to form the median nerve anterior to the third part of  the axil -\nlary artery .\n\u25a0 The ulnar nerve is a large terminal branch of  the \nmedial cord (Fig. 7.55). However, near its origin, it often receives a communicating branch from the lateral root of  the median nerve originating from the lateral cord and carrying fibers from C7 (see Fig. 5.73B). The ulnar nerve passes through the arm and forearm into the hand where it innervates all intrinsic muscles of  the hand (except for the three thenar muscles and the two lateral lumbrical muscles). On passing through the forearm, branches of  the ulnar nerve innervate the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and the medial half  of  the flexor digi -\ntorum profundus muscle.

The circular superior surface is concave for articulation with the capitulum of  the humerus. The thick margin of  the disc is broad medi -\nally where it articulates with the radial notch on the proxi -\nmal end of  the ulna.\nThe neck of  the radius is a short and narrow cylinder \nof  bone between the expanded head and the radial tuberos -\nity on the shaft.\nThe radial tuberosity is a large blunt projection on the \nmedial surface of  the radius immediately inferior to the neck. Much of  its surface is roughened for the attachment of  the biceps brachii tendon. The oblique line of  the radius continues diagonally across the shaft of  the bone from the inferior margin of  the radial tuberosity .\nProximal end of the ulna\nThe proximal end of  the ulna is much larger than the proximal end of  the radius and consists of  the olecranon, the coronoid process, the trochlear notch, the radial notch, and the tuberosity of  the ulna (Fig. 7.63A,B).\nThe olecranon is a large projection of  bone that \nextends proximally from the ulna. Its anterolateral surface is articular and contributes to the formation of  the troch-lear notch, which articulates with the trochlea of  the humerus. The superior surface is marked by a large  \nroughened impression for the attachment of  the triceps brachii muscle.

Its superolateral surface is articular and participates, with the olecranon, in forming the trochlear notch. The lateral surface is \nmarked by the radial notch for articulation with the head \nof  the radius.\nJust inferior to the radial notch is a fossa that allows the \nradial tuberosity to change position during pronation and supination. The posterior margin of  this fossa is broadened to form the supinator crest. The anterior surface of  the \ncoronoid process is triangular, with the apex directed dis -\ntally , and has a number of  roughenings for muscle attach -\nment. The largest of  these roughenings, the tuberosity of  \nthe ulna, is at the apex of  the anterior surface and is the attachment site for the brachialis muscle.Distally , the bone becomes flattened, and these borders \nexpand as the lateral supraepicondylar ridge (lateral \nsupracondylar ridge) and the medial supraepicondy-lar ridge  (medial supracondylar ridge ). The lateral \nsupraepicondylar ridge is more pronounced than the medial ridge and is roughened for the attachment of  muscles found in the posterior compartment of  the forearm.\nThe distal end of  the humerus, which is flattened in the \nanteroposterior plane, bears a condyle, two epicondyles, and three fossae, as follows (Fig. 7.61).\nThe condyle\nThe two articular parts of  the condyle, the capitulum and the trochlea, articulate with the two bones of  the forearm.\nThe capitulum articulates with the radius of  the \nforearm. Lateral in position and hemispherical in shape, it projects anteriorly and somewhat inferiorly and is not visible when the humerus is viewed from the posterior aspect.\nThe trochlea articulates with the ulna of  the forearm. \nIt is pulley shaped and lies medial to the capitulum. Its medial edge is more pronounced than its lateral edge and, unlike the capitulum, it extends onto the posterior surface of  the bone.\nThe two epicondyles\nThe two epicondyles lie adjacent, and somewhat superior, to the trochlea and capitulum (Fig. 7.61).\nThe medial epicondyle, a large bony protuberance, is \nthe major palpable landmark on the medial side of  the elbow, and projects medially from the distal end of  the humerus. On its surface, it bears a large oval  impression \nfor the attachment of  muscles in the anterior compart -\nment of  the forearm. The ulnar nerve passes from the arm into the forearm around the posterior surface of  the medial epicondyle and can be palpated against the bone in this location.\nThe lateral epicondyle is much less pronounced than \nthe medial epicondyle.

Beginning as a continuation of  the axillary artery at the lower border of  the teres major muscle, it terminates just distal to the elbow joint where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries.\nIn the proximal arm, the brachial artery lies on the \nmedial side. In the distal arm, it moves laterally to assume a position midway between the lateral epicondyle and the medial epicondyle of  the humerus. It crosses anteriorly to the elbow joint where it lies immediately medial to the tendon of  the biceps brachii muscle. The brachial artery is palpable along its length.

Additional branches are the profunda brachii artery and nutrient arteries to the humerus, which pass through a foramen in the anteromedial surface of  the humeral shaft.\nProfunda brachii artery\nThe profunda brachii artery, the largest branch of   \nthe brachial artery , passes into and supplies the posterior Table 7.9  Muscle o f the posterior compartment of the arm (spinal segment indicated in bold is the major segment innervating  \nthe muscle)\nMuscle Origin Insertion Innervation Function\nTriceps brachii Long head\u2014infraglenoid tubercle of scapula; \nmedial head\u2014posterior surface of humerus; lateral head\u2014posterior surface of humerusOlecranon Radial nerve (C6, C7, C8)Extension of the forearm at the elbow joint; long head can also extend and adduct the arm at the shoulder joint\nIn the clinic\nBlood pressure measurement\nBlood pressure measurement is an extremely important \nphysiological parameter. High blood pressure (hypertension) requires treatment to prevent long-term \ncomplications such as stroke. Low blood pressure may be \ncaused by extreme blood loss, widespread infection, or poor cardiac output (e.g., after myocardial infarction). Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential.\nMost clinicians use a sphygmomanometer and a \nstethoscope. The sphygmomanometer is a device that inflates a cuff around the midportion of the arm to compress the brachial artery against the humerus. The cuff is inflated so it exceeds the systolic blood pressure \n(greater than 120  mm Hg). The clinician places a \nstethoscope over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa and listens (auscultates) for the pulse. As the pressure in the arm cuff of the sphygmomanometer is reduced just \nbelow the level of the systolic blood pressure, the pulse \nbecomes audible as a regular thumping sound. As the pressure in the sphygmomanometer continues to drop, the regular thumping sound becomes clearer. When the pressure in the sphygmomanometer is less than that of \nthe diastolic blood pressure, the audible thumping sound \nbecomes inaudible. Using the simple scale on the sphygmomanometer, the patient\u2019s blood pressure can be \ndetermined. The normal range is 90\u2013120/60\u201380  mm Hg \n(systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure)."

It is one of the typical \ninjuries that occur with a fall on the outstretched hand. On \nfalling, the force is transmitted to the radial head, which \nfractures. These fractures typically result in loss of full \nextension, and potential surgical reconstruction may require \nlong periods of physiotherapy to obtain a full range of \nmovement at the elbow joint.\nA lateral radiograph of a fracture of the head of the radius \ntypically demonstrates the secondary phenomenon of this injury. When the bone is fractured, fluid fills the synovial \ncavity, elevating the small pad of fat within the coronoid and \nolecranon fossae. These fat pads appear as areas of lucency \non the lateral radiograph\u2014the \u201cfat pad\u201d sign. This \nradiological finding is useful because fracture of the head of \nthe radius is not always clearly visible.

It may also be \ntreated with injection of the patient\u2019s own plasma, rich in \nplatelets, into the tendon to promote tendon healing and \nrepair. If pain and inflammation persist, surgical division of \nthe extensor or flexor origin from the bone may be \nnecessary.

Generally , these muscles are associated with:\n\u25a0 mo vements of  the wrist joint,\n\u25a0 fle xion of  the fingers including the thumb, and\n\u25a0 pronation.\nAll muscles in the anterior compartment of  the forearm \nare innervated by the median nerve, except for the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and the medial half  of  the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, which are innervated by the ulnar nerve.Because the hand articulates predominantly with the \nradius, the translocation of  the distal end of  the radius medially over the ulna moves the hand from the palm-anterior (supinated) position to the palm-posterior (pro -\nnated) position.\nTwo muscles supinate and two muscles pronate the \nhand (Fig. 7.83).\nMuscles involved in pronation and supination\nBiceps brachii.  The biceps brachii muscle, the largest \nof  the four muscles that supinate and pronate the hand, is a powerful supinator as well as a flexor of  the elbow joint. It is most effective as a supinator when the forearm is  \nflexed.\nSupinator.  The second of  the muscles involved with \nsupination is the supinator muscle. Located in the poste -\nrior compartment of  the forearm, it has a broad origin, from the supinator crest of  the ulna and the lateral epicon -\ndyle of  the humerus and from ligaments associated with the elbow joint.\nThe supinator muscle curves around the posterior \nsurface and the lateral surface of  the upper third of  the radius to attach to the shaft of  the radius superior to the oblique line.\nThe tendon of  the biceps brachii muscle and the supina-\ntor muscle both become wrapped around the proximal end of  the radius when the hand is pronated (Fig. 7.83). When they contract, they unwrap from the bone, producing supination of  the hand.\nPronator teres and pronator quadratus.  Pronation results \nfrom the action of  the pronator teres and pronator \nquadratus muscles (Fig. 7.83). Both these muscles are in the anterior compartment of  the forearm:\n\u25a0 The prona tor teres runs from the medial epicondyle of  \nthe humerus to the lateral surface of  the radius, approximately midway along the shaft.\n\u25a0 The prona tor quadratus extends between the anterior \nsurfaces of  the distal ends of  the radius and ulna.\nWhen these muscles contract, they pull the distal end of  \nthe radius over the ulna, resulting in pronation of  the hand \n(Fig. 7.83).\nAnconeus.  In addition to hinge-like flexion and exten -\nsion at the elbow joint, some abduction of  the distal end of  the ulna also occurs and maintains the position of  the palm of  the hand over a central axis during pronation (Fig. 7.84). The muscle involved in this movement is the anconeus muscle, which is a triangular muscle in the posterior compartment of  the forearm that runs from  Fig. 7.84  Abd uction of the distal end of the ulna by the anconeus \nduring pronation. \nAbduction of\nulna by anconeus\nduring pronation\nAxis of movement\nwith abduction of ulnaAnconeus"

The muscle fibers converge on a tendon that passes distally and attaches to the pisiform bone of  the wrist. From this point, force is transferred to the hamate bone of  the wrist and to the base of  metacarpal V by the pisohamate and pisometacarpal ligaments.\nThe flexor carpi ulnaris muscle is a powerful flexor and \nadductor of  the wrist and is innervated by the ulnar nerve (Table 7.10).\nPalmaris longus\nThe palmaris longus muscle, which is absent in about \n15% of  the population, lies between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor carpi radialis muscles (Fig. 7.85A). It is a spindle-shaped muscle with a long tendon, which passes into the hand and attaches to the flexor retinaculum and to a thick layer of  deep fascia, the palmar aponeurosis, which underlies and is attached to the skin of  the palm and fingers.\nIn addition to its role as an accessory flexor of  the wrist \njoint, the palmaris longus muscle also opposes shearing forces on the skin of  the palm during gripping (Table 7.10).\nFlexor carpi radialis\nThe flexor carpi radialis muscle is lateral to the palmaris \nlongus and has a large and prominent tendon in the distal half  of  the forearm (Fig. 7.85A and Table 7.10). Unlike the \ntendon of  the flexor carpi ulnaris, which forms the medial margin of  the distal forearm, the tendon of  the flexor carpi radialis muscle is positioned just lateral to the midline. In this position, the tendon can be easily palpated, making it an important landmark for finding the pulse in the radial artery , which lies immediately lateral to it.\nThe tendon of  the flexor carpi radialis passes through a \ncompartment formed by bone and fascia on the lateral side of  the anterior surface of  the wrist and attaches to the anterior surfaces of  the bases of  metacarpals II and III.\nThe flexor carpi radialis is a powerful flexor of  the wrist \nand can also abduct the wrist.\nPronator teres\nThe pronator teres muscle originates from the medial \nepicondyle and supraepicondylar ridge of  the humerus and from a small linear region on the medial edge of  the coronoid process of  the ulna (Fig. 7.85A). The median nerve often exits the cubital fossa by passing between the humeral and ulnar heads of  this muscle. The pronator teres crosses the forearm and attaches to an oval rough -\nened area on the lateral surface of  the radius approximately midway along the bone."

The tendon contributes to the lateral border of  the anatomical snuffbox at the wrist.\nThe major function of  the abductor pollicis longus is to \nabduct the thumb at the joint between the metacarpal I and trapezium bones (Table 7.14).\nExtensor pollicis brevis\nThe extensor pollicis brevis muscle arises distal to the \norigin of  the abductor pollicis longus from the posterior surface of  the radius and interosseous membrane  \n(Fig. 7.91). Together with the abductor pollicis longus, it emerges between the extensor digitorum and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles to form a bulge on the postero -\nlateral surface of  the distal forearm. The tendon of  the extensor pollicis brevis passes into the thumb and inserts on the dorsal surface of  the base of  the proximal phalanx.

It is subdivided into three parts:\n\u25a0 the wrist (car pus),\n\u25a0 the metacar pus, and\n\u25a0 the digits (fiv e fingers including the thumb).\nThe five digits consist of  the laterally positioned thumb \nand, medial to the thumb, the four fingers\u2014the index, middle, ring, and little fingers.\nIn the normal resting position, the fingers form a flexed \narcade, with the little finger flexed most and the index finger flexed least. In the anatomical position, the fingers are extended.\nThe hand has an anterior surface ( palm) and a dorsal \nsurface (dorsum of  hand ).\nAbduction and adduction of  the fingers are defined with \nrespect to the long axis of  the middle finger (Fig. 7.93). In the anatomical position, the long axis of  the thumb is Anterior interosseous artery\nThe anterior interosseous artery , also a branch of  the common interosseous branch of  the ulnar artery , is situ -\nated in the anterior compartment of  the forearm on the interosseous membrane.

The terminal end of  the anterior interosseous artery passes posteriorly through an aperture in the interosseous membrane in distal regions of  the forearm to join the posterior interosseous artery .\nRadial artery\nThe radial artery has muscular branches, which contribute to the supply of  the extensor muscles on the radial side of  the forearm.\nVeins\nDeep veins of  the posterior compartment generally accompany the arteries. They ultimately drain into bra-chial veins associated with the brachial artery in the cubital fossa.\nNerves\nRadial nerve\nThe nerve of  the posterior compartment of  the forearm is the radial nerve (Fig. 7.92). Most of  the muscles are inner -\nvated by the deep branch, which originates from the radial nerve in the lateral wall of  the cubital fossa deep to the brachioradialis muscle and becomes the posterior inter -\nosseous nerve after emerging from between the superficial and deep layers of  the supinator muscle in the posterior compartment of  the forearm.\nIn the lateral wall of  the cubital fossa, and before divid -\ning into superficial and deep branches, the radial nerve innervates the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles.\nThe deep branch innervates the extensor carpi radialis \nbrevis, then passes between the two layers of  the supinator muscle and follows the plane of  separation between the two layers dorsally and laterally around the proximal shaft of  the radius to the posterior aspect of  the forearm. It sup -\nplies the supinator muscle and then emerges, as the poste -\nrior interosseous nerve, from the muscle to lie between the superficial and deep layers of  muscles.\nThe posterior interosseous nerve supplies the remaining \nmuscles in the posterior compartment and terminates as articular branches, which pass deep to the extensor pollicis longus muscle to reach the wrist.\nFig. 7.93  Right hand.

Movements at this carpometacarpal joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, and circumduction.\nThe carpometacarpal joints between metacarpals II to \nV and the carpal bones are much less mobile than the carpometacarpal joint of  the thumb, allowing only limited gliding movements. Movement of  the joints increases medially , so metacarpal V slides to the greatest degree. This can be best observed on the dorsal surface of  the hand as it makes a fist.\nMetacarpophalangeal joints\nThe joints between the distal heads of  the metacarpals and the proximal phalanges of  the digits are condylar joints, which allow flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, cir -\ncumduction, and limited rotation (Fig. 7.94). The capsule of  each joint is reinforced by the palmar ligament and by \nmedial and lateral collateral ligaments .\nDeep transverse metacarpal ligaments\nThe three deep transverse metacarpal ligaments  \n(Fig. 7.95) are thick bands of  connective tissue connecting the palmar ligaments of  the metacarpophalangeal joints of  the fingers to each other.

The etiology of this condition is often obscure, \nthough in some instances the nerve injury may be a direct \neffect of increased pressure on the median nerve caused by overuse, swelling of the tendons and tendon sheaths (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and cysts arising from the carpal joints. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel is \nthought to cause venous congestion that produces nerve \nedema and anoxic damage to the capillary endothelium of the median nerve itself.\nPatients typically report pain and pins-and-needles \nsensations in the distribution of the median nerve. Weakness and loss of muscle bulk of the thenar muscles may also occur. Gently tapping over the median nerve (in the region of the flexor retinaculum) readily produces these symptoms (Tinel\u2019s sign).\nInitial treatment is aimed at reducing the inflammation \nand removing any repetitive insults that produce the symptoms. If this does not lead to improvement, nerve conduction studies will be necessary to confirm nerve entrapment, which may require surgical decompression of \nthe flexor retinaculum.\nIn the clinic\nMedian artery\nA large median artery is an anatomical variant found in \nsome individuals, where a persistent artery runs alongside the median nerve in one or both forearms and through \nthe carpal tunnel.

This may improve grip.\nThe palmaris brevis is innervated by the superficial \nbranch of  the ulnar nerve.\nAnatomical snuffbox\nThe \u201canatomical snuffbox\u201d is a term given to the triangular depression formed on the posterolateral side of  the wrist and metacarpal I by the extensor tendons passing into the thumb (Fig. 7.100). Historically , ground tobacco (snuff) was placed in this depression before being inhaled into the nose. The base of  the triangle is at the wrist and the apex is directed into the thumb. The impression is most apparent when the thumb is extended:Palmar aponeurosis\nThe palmar aponeurosis is a triangular condensation of  \ndeep fascia that covers the palm and is anchored to the skin in distal regions (Fig. 7.99).\nThe apex of  the triangle is continuous with the palmaris \nlongus tendon, when present; otherwise, it is anchored to the flexor retinaculum. From this point, fibers radiate to extensions at the bases of  the digits that project into each of  the index, middle, ring, and little fingers and, to a lesser extent, the thumb.\nTransverse fibers interconnect the more longitudinally \narranged bundles that continue into the digits.\nVessels, nerves, and long flexor tendons lie deep to the \npalmar aponeurosis in the palm.\nFig. 7.99  P almar aponeurosis, right hand. \nLongitudinal fibers\nof palmar aponeurosis\nPalmaris brevis\nmuscleTransverse fibers\nof palmar aponeurosisIn the clinic\nDupuytren\u2019s contracture\nThe palmar fascia can become abnormally thickened in \ncertain individuals, causing the fingers to progressively develop a fixed flexion position. This results in loss of \ndexterity and function, and in severe cases requires \nsurgical removal of the abnormal tissue."

Origi -\nnating from the tubercle of  the trapezium and the adjacent flexor retinaculum, it inserts along the entire length of  the lateral margin and adjacent lateral palmar surface of  metacarpal I.\nThe opponens pollicis rotates and flexes metacarpal  \nI on the trapezium, so bringing the pad of  the thumb into a position facing the pads of  the fingers (Table 7.15).\nAbductor pollicis brevis\nThe abductor pollicis brevis  muscle overlies the oppo -\nnens pollicis and is proximal to the flexor pollicis brevis muscle (Fig. 7.107). It originates from the tubercles of  the scaphoid and trapezium and from the adjacent flexor reti -\nnaculum, and inserts into the lateral side of  the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the thumb and into the extensor hood.\nThe abductor pollicis brevis abducts the thumb, princi -\npally at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Its action is most apparent when the thumb is maximally abducted and the proximal phalanx is moved out of  line with the long axis of  the metacarpal bone (Table 7.15).\nFlexor pollicis brevis\nThe flexor pollicis brevis  muscle is distal to the abductor \npollicis brevis (Fig. 7.107). It originates mainly from the tubercle of  the trapezium and adjacent flexor retinaculum, but it may also have deeper attachments to other carpal bones and associated ligaments. It inserts into the lateral side of  the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the thumb. The tendon often contains a sesamoid bone.in the thenar and hypothenar muscle groups, respectively , and therefore do not have dorsal interossei.\nThe radial artery passes between the two heads of  the \nfirst dorsal interosseous muscle as it passes from the ana -\ntomical snuffbox on the posterolateral side of  the wrist into the deep aspect of  the palm.\nPalmar interossei\nThe three (or four) palmar interossei are anterior to the \ndorsal interossei, and are unipennate muscles originating from the metacarpals of  the digits with which each is associated (Fig. 7.105).\nThe first palmar interosseous muscle is rudimentary \nand often considered part of  either the adductor pollicis or the flexor pollicis brevis. When present, it originates from the medial side of  the palmar surface of  metacarpal I  \nand inserts into both the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the thumb and into the extensor hood. A sesamoid bone often occurs in the tendon attached to the base of  the phalanx.\nThe second palmar interosseous muscle originates  \nfrom the medial surface of  metacarpal II and inserts  \ninto the medial side of  the extensor hood of  the index finger.\nThe third and fourth palmar interossei originate from \nthe lateral surfaces of  metacarpals IV and V and insert into the lateral sides of  the respective extensor hoods.\nLike the tendons of  the dorsal interossei, the tendons of  \nthe palmar interossei pass dorsal to the deep transverse metacarpal ligaments.\nThe palmar interossei adduct the thumb, index, ring, \nand little fingers with respect to a long axis through the middle finger. The movements occur at the metacarpopha-langeal joints. Because the muscles insert into the extensor hoods, they also produce complex flexion and extension movements of  the digits (Table 7.15).\nAdductor pollicis\nThe adductor pollicis is a large triangular muscle  \nanterior to the plane of  the interossei that crosses the palm (Fig. 7.106). It originates as two heads:\n\u25a0 a transverse head from the anterior aspect of  the shaft \nof  metacarpal III, and\n\u25a0 an oblique head, from the capitate and adjacent bases \nof  metacarpals II and III.\nThe two heads converge laterally to form a tendon, \nwhich often contains a sesamoid bone, that inserts into \nboth the medial side of  the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the thumb and into the extensor hood."

The muscles originate from the tendons of  the flexor digitorum profun -\ndus in the palm:\n\u25a0 The medial tw o lumbricals are bipennate and originate \nfrom the flexor digitorum profundus tendons associated with the middle and ring fingers and the ring and little fingers, respectively .\n\u25a0 The la teral two lumbricals are unipennate muscles, \noriginating from the flexor digitorum profundus  \ntendons associated with the index and middle fingers, respectively .\nThe lumbricals pass dorsally around the lateral side of  \neach finger, and insert into the extensor hood (Fig. 7.108). \nThe tendons of  the muscles are anterior to the deep trans -\nverse metacarpal ligaments.\nThe lumbricals are unique because they link flexor \ntendons with extensor tendons. Through their insertion into the extensor hoods, they participate in flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints and extending the interpha -\nlangeal joints.\nThe medial two lumbricals are innervated by the  \ndeep branch of  the ulnar nerve; the lateral two lumbricals are innervated by digital branches of  the median nerve (Table 7.15).\nArteries and veins\nThe blood supply to the hand is by the radial and ulnar arteries, which form two interconnected vascular arches (superficial and deep) in the palm (Fig. 7.109). Vessels to the digits, muscles, and joints originate from the two arches and the parent arteries:\n\u25a0 The radial artery contributes substantially to the supply \nof  the thumb and the lateral side of  the index finger.The flexor pollicis brevis flexes the metacarpophalangeal \njoint of  the thumb (Table 7.15).\nHypothenar muscles\nThe hypothenar muscles (the opponens digiti minimi, abductor digiti minimi, and flexor digiti minimi brevis)  \ncontribute to the swelling (hypothenar eminence) on the medial side of  the palm at the base of  the little finger (Fig. 7.107). The hypothenar muscles are similar to the thenar muscles in name and in organization.\nUnlike the thenar muscles, the hypothenar muscles are \ninnervated by the deep branch of  the ulnar nerve and not by the recurrent branch of  the median nerve.\nOpponens digiti minimi\nThe opponens digiti minimi muscle lies deep to the other \ntwo hypothenar muscles (Fig. 7.107). It originates from the hook of  the hamate and from the adjacent flexor reti -\nnaculum and it inserts into the medial margin and palmar surface of  metacarpal V . Its base is penetrated by the deep branches of  the ulnar nerve and ulnar artery .\nThe opponens digiti minimi rotates metacarpal V toward \nthe palm; however, because of  the simple shape of  the carpometacarpal joint and the presence of  a deep trans -\nverse metacarpal ligament, which attaches the head of  metacarpal V to that of  the ring finger, the movement is much less dramatic than that of  the thumb (Table 7.15).\nAbductor digiti minimi\nThe abductor digiti minimi  muscle overlies the opponens \ndigiti minimi (Fig. 7.107). It originates from the pisiform bone, the pisohamate ligament, and the tendon of  the flexor carpi ulnaris, and inserts into the medial side of  the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the little finger and into the extensor hood.\nThe abductor digiti minimi is the principal abductor of  \nthe little finger (Table 7.15).\nFlexor digiti minimi brevis\nThe flexor digiti minimi brevis  muscle is lateral to the \nabductor digiti minimi (Fig. 7.107). It originates from  \nthe hook of  the hamate bone and the adjacent flexor reti -\nnaculum and inserts with the abductor digiti minimi muscle into the medial side of  the base of  the proximal phalanx of  the little finger."

The ideal sites for venous access are \ntypically in the cubital fossa and in the cephalic vein \nadjacent to the anatomical snuffbox. The veins are simply distended by use of a tourniquet. A tourniquet should be applied enough to allow the veins to become prominent. For straightforward blood tests the antecubital vein is \nusually the preferred site, and although it may not always \nbe visible, it is easily palpated. The cephalic vein is generally the preferred site for a short-term intravenous cannula.Nerves\nThe hand is supplied by the ulnar, median, and radial \nnerves (Figs. 7.113 to 7.115). All three nerves contribute to cutaneous or general sensory innervation. The ulnar nerve innervates all intrinsic muscles of  the hand except for the three thenar muscles and the two lateral lumbricals, which are innervated by the median nerve. The radial nerve only innervates skin on the dorsolateral side of   \nthe hand.\nUlnar nerve\nThe ulnar nerve enters the hand lateral to the pisiform and posteromedially to the ulnar artery (Fig. 7.113). Immedi -\nately distal to the pisiform, it divides into a deep branch, which is mainly motor, and a superficial branch, which is mainly sensory .\nThe deep branch of  the ulnar nerve passes with the \ndeep branch of  the ulnar artery (Fig. 7.113). It penetrates and supplies the hypothenar muscles to reach the deep aspect of  the palm, arches laterally across the palm, deep to the long flexors of  the digits, and supplies the interossei, the adductor pollicis, and the two medial lumbricals. In addition, the deep branch of  the ulnar nerve contributes small articular branches to the wrist joint."

Function of the adductor \npollicis muscle is also lost.\nIn lesions of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, function of the \nflexor carpi ulnaris muscle and flexor digitorum profundus to \nthe medial two digits is lost as well. Clawing of the hand, particularly of the little and ring fingers, is worse with \nlesions of the ulnar nerve at the wrist than at the elbow \nbecause interruption of the nerve at the elbow paralyzes the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus, which leads to lack of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints in these \nfingers.\nUlnar nerve lesions at the elbow and wrist result in \nimpaired sensory innervation on the palmar aspect of the \nmedial one and one-half digits.\nDamage to the ulnar nerve at the wrist or at a site \nproximal to the wrist can be distinguished by evaluating the status of function of the dorsal branch (cutaneous) of the \nulnar nerve, which originates in distal regions of the forearm.

Originating from the lateral side of  the median nerve near the distal margin of  the flexor retinaculum, it curves around the margin of  the retinacu -\nlum and passes proximally over the flexor pollicis brevis muscle.

The surgical note reported that all of the \nbreast tissue had been removed, including the axillary \nprocess. In addition, the surgeon had dissected all lymph \nnodes within the axilla with their surrounding fat. The \npatient made an uneventful recovery.\nAt the first follow-up appointment, the patient\u2019s husband \ntold the surgeon that she had now developed a bony \n\u201cspike\u201d on her back. The surgeon was intrigued and asked \nthe patient to reveal this spike. At examination, the spike \nwas the inferior angle of the scapula, which appeared to be \nsticking out posteriorly (\u201cwinged\u201d). Raising the arms \naccentuated this structure.The medial border of the scapula was accentuated and  \nit was noted that there was some loss of bulk of the  \nserratus anterior muscle, which attaches to the tip of the \nscapula.\nThe nerve to this muscle was damaged.\nDuring the surgery on the axilla, the long thoracic nerve was \ndamaged as it passed down the lateral thoracic wall on the \nexternal surface of the serratus anterior, just deep to the skin \nand subcutaneous fascia.\nBecause the nerve was transected, it is unlikely that the \npatient will improve, but she was happy that she had an \nadequate explanation for the spike.\nCase 2\nCOMPLICATION OF A FRACTURED FIRST RIB\nA 25-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle \naccident and thrown from her motorcycle. When she was \nadmitted to the emergency room, she was unconscious. A \nseries of tests and investigations were performed, one of \nwhich included chest radiography. The attending physician \nnoted a complex fracture of the first rib on the left.\nMany important structures that supply the upper limb pass \nover rib I.\nIt is important to test the nerves that supply the arm and \nhand, although this is extremely difficult to do in an \nunconscious patient. However, some muscle reflexes can be \ndetermined using a tendon hammer. Also, it may be \npossible to test for pain reflexes in patients with altered \nconsciousness levels. Palpation of the axillary artery, brachial \nartery, radial artery, and ulnar artery pulses is necessary \nbecause a fracture of the first rib can sever and denude the \nsubclavian artery, which passes over it.A chest drain was immediately inserted because the lung \nhad collapsed. The fractured first rib had damaged the \nvisceral and parietal pleurae, allowing air from a torn lung to \nescape into the pleural cavity. The lung collapsed, and the \npleural cavity filled with air, which impaired lung function.\nA tube was inserted between the ribs, and the air was \nsucked out to re-inflate the lung.\nThe first rib is a deep structure at the base of the neck. It is \nnot uncommon for ribs to be broken after minor injuries, \nincluding sports injuries. However, rib I, which lies at the \nbase of the neck, is surrounded by muscles and soft tissues \nthat provide it with considerable protection. Therefore a \npatient with a fracture of the first rib has undoubtedly been \nsubjected to a considerable force, which usually occurs in a \ndeceleration injury. Other injuries should always be sought \nand the patient should be managed with a high level of \nconcern for deep neck and mediastinal injuries."

He examined the  \nfollowing:\nMusculoskeletal system\nThe musculoskeletal system includes the bones, joints, \nmuscles, and tendons. The resident looked for abnormalities \nand muscle wasting. Knowing which areas are wasted \nidentifies the nerve that supplies them. She palpated the \nindividual bones and palpated the scaphoid with the wrist in \nulnar deviation. She examined the movement of joints \nbecause they may be restricted by joint disease or inability \nof muscular contraction.\nCirculation\nPalpation of both radial and ulnar pulses is necessary. The \nresident looked for capillary return to assess how well the \nhand was perfused.\nExamination of the nerves\nThe three main nerves to the hand should be tested.\nMedian nerve\nThe median nerve innervates the skin on the palmar aspect \nof the lateral three and one-half digits, the dorsal aspect of \nthe distal phalanx, half of the middle phalanges of the same \nfingers, and a variable amount on the radial side of the palm \nof the hand. Median nerve damage results in wasting of the thenar eminence, absence of abduction of the thumb, and \nabsence of opposition of the thumb.\nUlnar nerve\nThe ulnar nerve innervates the skin of the anterior and \nposterior surfaces of the little finger and the ulnar side of \nthe ring finger, the skin over the hypothenar eminence, and \na similar strip of skin posteriorly. Sometimes the ulnar nerve \ninnervates all the skin of the ring finger and the ulnar side of \nthe middle finger.\nAn ulnar nerve palsy results in wasting of the hypothenar \neminence, absent flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints \nof the little and ring fingers, and absent abduction and \nadduction of the fingers. Adduction of the thumb also is \naffected.\nRadial nerve\nThe radial nerve innervates a small area of skin over the \nlateral aspect of metacarpal I and the back of the first web \nspace.\nThe radial nerve also produces extension of the wrist and \nextension of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal \njoints and of the digits.\nA very simple examination would include tests for the \nmedian nerve by opposition of the thumb, for the ulnar \nnerve by abduction and adduction of the digits, and for the \nradial nerve by extension of the wrist and fingers and feeling \non the back of the first web space."

The surgeon went ahead with the operation and  \nthe patient did not feel a thing.\nThe anesthetic was injected into the axillary sheath.\nIt would be almost impossible to anesthetize the wrist in the \nforearm because local anesthetic would have to be placed \naccurately around the ulnar, median, and radial nerves. \nFurthermore, all of the cutaneous branches of the forearm \nwould also have to be anesthetized individually, which \nwould take a considerable amount of time and probably \nproduce subtotal anesthesia.\nThe nerves of the upper limb originate from the brachial \nplexus, which surrounds the axillary artery within the axilla. \nImportantly, the axillary artery, axillary vein, and brachial plexus lie within the sleeve-like covering of fascia termed the \naxillary sheath. By injecting the anesthetic into the space \nenclosed by the axillary sheath, all of the nerves of the \nbrachial plexus were paralyzed.\nIt is possible with a patient\u2019s arm abducted and externally \nrotated (palm behind the head) to easily palpate the axillary \nartery and therefore locate the position of the axillary \nsheath. Once the axillary artery has been identified, a small \nneedle can be placed beside the vessel and local anesthetic \ncan be injected on both sides of it. The local anesthetic \ntracks along the axillary sheath in this region. The brachial \nplexus surrounding the axillary artery is therefore completely \nanesthetized and an effective local anesthetic \u201cblock\u201d is \nachieved.\n\u201cCould there be any complications?\u201d asks the patient.\nPotential complications are a direct needle spike of the \nbranches of the brachial plexus, damage to the axillary \nartery, and inadvertent arterial injection of the local \nanesthetic. Fortunately, these are rare in skilled hands.\nCase 4\nSHOULDER PROBLEM AFTER FALLING ON  \nAN OUTSTRETCHED HAND\nA 45-year-old man came to his physician complaining of \npain and weakness in his right shoulder. The pain began \nafter a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 \nmonths previously. The patient recalled having some minor \nshoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He \nwas otherwise fit and well.\nOn examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting \nof the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. \nThe patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there \nwas a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus.\nThe wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and \ninfraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was  \ndisuse.\nMuscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of \ndisorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common \ncauses. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of \nmuscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when \nmuscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy).\nThe supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles are supplied by \nthe suprascapular nerve (C5, C6), which originates from the \nsuperior trunk of the brachial plexus. Given that only these \nmuscles were involved, it is highly likely that the muscle \natrophy is caused by denervation. Denervation may result \nfrom a direct nerve transection, nerve compression, or a \npharmacological effect on the nerve.\nThe typical site for compression of the suprascapular nerve \nis the suprascapular notch (foramen) on the superior margin \nof the scapula.\nThe patient\u2019s apparently minor injury damaged the \nfibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum, which allowed a cyst to \nform and pass along the superior border of the scapula to \nthe suprascapular notch (foramen), where the cyst \ncompressed the suprascapular nerve.\nSurgical excision of the damaged glenoid labrum and \nremoval of the cyst improved the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The \nsymptoms were provoked by arm extension. Local \nanesthesia was also present around the base of the thenar \neminence.\nThe problem was diagnosed as median nerve compression.\nThe median nerve is formed from the lateral and medial \ncords of the brachial plexus anterior to the axillary artery  \nand passes into the arm anterior to the brachial artery. At \nthe level of the elbow joint it sits medial to the brachial \nartery, both of which are medial to the tendon of the biceps. \nIn the forearm the nerve courses through the anterior \ncompartment and passes deep to the flexor retinaculum. It \ninnervates most of the muscles of the forearm, the thenar \nmuscles, the two lateral lumbricals, and the skin over the \npalmar surface of the lateral three and one-half digits and \nover the lateral side of the palm and the middle of the wrist.\nIn this patient, the median nerve initially was believed to be \ntrapped below the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel \nsyndrome).\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a common problem in young to \nmiddle-aged patients. Typically the nerve becomes \ncompressed within the carpal tunnel. This syndrome may be \nassociated with a number of medical conditions, such as \nthyroid disease and pregnancy. Occasionally a small \nganglion or a tumor situated within the carpal tunnel can also compress the nerve. Other possibilities include \ntenosynovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nNerve conduction studies were performed to confirm the \nclinical findings. Nerve conduction studies are a series of \ntests that send small electrical impulses along the length of \na variety of nerves in order to measure the speed at which \nthe nerve conducts these pulses. The speed of the nerve \npulse can be measured and is referred to as the latency. In \nour patient it was noted that the nerve had normal latency \nto the elbow joint; however, below the elbow joint there \nwas increased latency.\nThe nerve conduction studies indicated that the compression \nsite was at the elbow joint.\nThe clinical findings are not consistent with carpal tunnel \nsyndrome. The clinician should have been alerted to this \nproblem given that the patient experienced numbness over \nthe thenar eminence of the hand. This clue indicates an \nunderstanding of the anatomy. Compression of the nerve \nwithin the carpal tunnel does not produce this numbness, \nbecause the small cutaneous branch that supplies this region \nis proximal to the flexor retinaculum.\nThe nerve compromise was caused by the ligament of \nStruthers, which is an embryological remnant of the \ncoracobrachialis muscle. It is an extremely rare finding. \nOccasionally it may ossify and cross the nerve, artery, and \nvein to produce compression in arm extension. Although this \nis very rare and unusual, it illustrates the complex course of \nthe median nerve.\nCase 7\nIMMOBILIZING THE EXTENSOR DIGITORUM MUSCLE\nAfter a hard day\u2019s studying, two medical students decided \nto meet for coffee. The more senior student said to the \nfreshman that he would bet him $50 that he could not lift a \nmatchbook with a finger. The freshman placed $50 on the \ntable and the bet was on. The senior medical student told \nthe freshman to make a fist and place it in a \npalm-downward position, so that the middle phalanges of \nthe fingers were in direct contact with the bar counter. He \nwas then told to extend his middle finger so that it stuck \nforward while maintaining the middle phalanges of the \nindex finger, the ring finger, and the little finger on the bar \nsurface.\nA matchbook was placed on top of the freshman\u2019s middle \nfingernail and he was told to flip it. He couldn\u2019t. He lost the \n$50.Extension of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers is \nperformed by the extensor digitorum muscle.\nPlacing the fist in a palm-down position on the table and \npressing the middle phalanges onto the table effectively \nimmobilizes the action of the extensor digitorum. The \nfreshman was therefore unable to elevate his middle finger \n(which was sticking out). It is important to remember that if \nthis same procedure is carried out leaving the index or little \nfinger free to move, they do. This is because these two \ndigits are extended not only by the extensor digitorum \nmuscle but also by the extensor indicis muscle (index \nfinger) and extensor digiti minimi muscle (little finger)."

Further examination revealed loss of muscle bulk \nin the supraspinous fossa. The supraspinatus muscle was \ndamaged.\nAbduction of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint is \ninitiated by the supraspinatus muscle. After the shoulder has \nbeen abducted to 10\u00b0\u201315\u00b0, the deltoid muscle continues the \nmovement. The patient was able to abduct her arm by lowering and tilting the glenohumeral joint inferiorly to enable the deltoid to obtain its mechanical advantage.\nThe loss of muscle bulk in the supraspinous fossa suggested \nmuscle atrophy.\nMuscle atrophy occurs when a muscle is not used. The \northopedic surgeon thought that there was a tear of the supraspinatus tendon beneath the acromion. If this was so, \nthe muscle would atrophy.\nThe diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound scan.The patient was seated on a stool and her right shoulder \nwas uncovered. The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right \nbuttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for \nultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial \nsubdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent  \na surgical repair and made a good recovery.\neFig. 7.128  Ultrasound showing a c ompletely torn \nsupraspinatus tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid \nbursa. \nDeltoid muscle\nTear in supraspinatus tendon Normal supraspinatus tendonHead of humerus Head of humerus"

            "Text": "Upper Limb\n821.e4\nCase 9\nSHOULDER JOINT PROBLEM\nA 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a \nhistory of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder ( eFig. \n7.129 ). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder \njoint prior to any treatment.\nThe MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple \nplanes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular \nstructures that may have been damaged and require surgical \nrepair.\nThe MRI demonstrated a divot in the posterosuperior aspect \nof the humeral head and a small fragment of bone and \nglenoid labrum that had become separated in the \nanteroinferior aspect of the glenoid cavity.\nShoulder dislocation is not an uncommon problem and may \noccur as a \u201conce-off\u201d or with repetitive injury may be recurrent. Recurrent dislocations may be bilateral and \nsymmetrical (a memory aid is \u201ctorn loose or born loose\u201d).\nThe MRI findings are typical for an anteroinferior dislocation, \nwhich is the most common type; moreover the MRI demonstrates the injuries that occur within the joint at the \ntime of dislocation. These injuries include the abutment of \nthe posterosuperior aspect of the humeral head on the anteroinferior aspect of the glenoid cavity. This type of injury, when recurrent, may avulse a small fragment of the glenoid labrum, and in some cases this may attach to a \nsmall fragment of bone (the Bankart lesion). When the \nshoulder is relocated, the integrity of the capsular attachment anteroinferiorly has been disrupted, potentially making the shoulder somewhat prone to further dislocation.\nAn arthroscopic repair was performed.\nArthroscopy of the shoulder is an established method for \nassessing the shoulder joint. Portals of entry are anterior and posterior and small holes in the capsule are made percutaneously. The shoulder joint is filled with saline, which distends it, allowing the arthroscope to move around the \njoint and inspect the joint surfaces, including the labrum. \nThe labrum and its bony fragment were reattached and sutured using anchor sutures (somewhat similar to staples). The anterior aspect of the capsule was also tightened.\nThe patient made an uneventful recovery.\nAfter the procedure the arm was held in internal rotation and \nremained adducted. Gentle exercise and physiotherapy were performed and the patient returned to playing baseball.\neFig. 7.129  The radiograph, ant eroposterior view, \ndemonstrates an anteroinferior dislocation of the humeral head \nat the glenohumeral joint."

They are:\n\u25a0 the cr anial cavity ,\n\u25a0 tw o ears,\n\u25a0 tw o orbits,\n\u25a0 tw o nasal cavities, and\n\u25a0 an or al cavity (Fig. 8.1).\nThe cranial cavity is the largest compartment  \nand contains the brain and associated membranes (meninges).\nMost of  the ear apparatus on each side is contained \nwithin one of  the bones forming the floor of  the cranial cavity . The external parts of  the ears extend laterally from these regions.\nThe two orbits contain the eyes. They are cone-shaped \nchambers immediately inferior to the anterior aspect of  the cranial cavity , and the apex of  each cone is directed pos -\nteromedially . The walls of  the orbits are bone, whereas the base of  each conical chamber can be opened and closed by the eyelids.\nThe nasal cavities are the upper parts of  the respira -\ntory tract and are between the orbits. They have walls, floors, and ceilings, which are predominantly composed of  bone and cartilage. The anterior openings to the nasal cavities are nares (nostrils), and the posterior openings \nare choanae (posterior nasal apertures).\nContinuous with the nasal cavities are air-filled  \nextensions (paranasal sinuses), which project laterally , superiorly , and posteriorly into surrounding bones.  \nThe largest, the maxillary sinuses, are inferior to the \norbits.\nThe oral cavity is inferior to the nasal cavities, and \nseparated from them by the hard and soft palates . The \nfloor of  the oral cavity is formed entirely of  soft tissues.\nThe anterior opening to the oral cavity is the oral \nfissure (mouth), and the posterior opening is the oropha-ryngeal isthmus. Unlike the nares and choanae, which are continuously open, both the oral fissure and oropha-ryngeal isthmus can be opened and closed by surrounding soft tissues."

The clinical consequences of  a skull fracture in this area can be very serious. The bone in this area is particularly thin and overlies the anterior division of  the middle meningeal artery , which can be torn by a skull fracture in this area, resulting in an extradural hematoma.\nThe final articulation across the lower part of  the lateral \nportion of  the calvaria is between the temporal bone and the occipital bone at the occipitomastoid suture.\nTemporal bone\nA major contributor to the lower portion of  the lateral wall of  the cranium is the temporal bone (Fig. 8.19), which consists of  several parts:\n\u25a0 The squamous part has the appearance of  a large  \nflat plate, forms the anterior and superior parts of  the temporal bone, contributes to the lateral wall of  the cranium, and articulates anteriorly with the greater wing of  the sphenoid bone at the sphenosquamous suture, and with the parietal bone superiorly at the squamous suture.\n\u25a0 The zygomatic process is an anterior bony projection \nfrom the lower surface of  the squamous part of  the temporal bone that initially projects laterally and then curves anteriorly to articulate with the temporal process of  the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.\n\u25a0 Immedia tely below the origin of  the zygomatic process \nfrom the squamous part of  the temporal bone is the tympanic part of  the temporal bone, and clearly visible on the surface of  this part is the external acoustic"

It has four parts orga -\nnized around the foramen magnum, which is a prominent feature of  this part of  the base of  the skull and through which the brain and spinal cord are continuous.\nThe parts of  the occipital bone are the squamous part, \nwhich is posterior to the foramen magnum, the lateral \nparts, which are lateral to the foramen magnum, and the basilar part, which is anterior to the foramen magnum \n(Fig. 8.23).\nThe squamous and lateral parts are components of  the \nposterior part of  the base of  the skull.\nThe most visible feature of  the squamous part of  the \noccipital bone when examining the inferior view of  the skull is a ridge of  bone (the external occipital crest), which extends downward from the external occipital protuber -\nance toward the foramen magnum. The inferior nuchal lines arc laterally from the midpoint of  the crest.\nImmediately lateral to the foramen magnum are the \nlateral parts of  the occipital bones, which contain numer -\nous important structural features.\nOn each anterolateral border of  the foramen magnum \nare the rounded occipital condyles (Fig. 8.23). These \npaired structures articulate with the atlas (vertebra CI). Posterior to each condyle is a depression (the condylar \nfossa) containing a condylar canal, and anterior and superior to each condyle is the large hypoglossal canal. \nLateral to each hypoglossal canal is a large, irregular jugular foramen formed by opposition of  the jugular \nnotch of  the occipital bone and jugular notch of  the \ntemporal bone.\nTemporal bone\nLaterally in the posterior part of  the base of  the skull is the temporal bone. The parts of  the temporal bone seen in this location are the mastoid part of  the petromastoid part and the styloid process (Fig. 8.23).\nThe lateral edge of  the mastoid part is identified by the \nlarge cone-shaped mastoid process projecting from its inferior surface. This prominent bony structure is the point of  attachment for several muscles. On the medial aspect of  the mastoid process is the deep mastoid notch, which is also an attachment point for a muscle.\nAnteromedial to the mastoid process is the needle-\nshaped styloid process projecting from the lower border of  the temporal bone.

It extends posteriorly to the foramen magnum \nand is bounded laterally by the temporal bones.\nProminent on the basilar part of  the occipital bone is \nthe pharyngeal tubercle, a bony protuberance for the \nattachment of  parts of  the pharynx to the base of  the skull (Fig. 8.23).\nT emporal bone\nImmediately lateral to the basilar part of  the occipital  \nbone is the petrous part of  the petromastoid part of  each temporal bone.\nWedge-shaped in its appearance, with its apex antero-\nmedial, the petrous part of  the temporal bone is between the greater wing of  the sphenoid anteriorly and the basilar part of  the occipital bone posteriorly . The apex forms one of  the boundaries of  the foramen lacerum, an irregular opening filled in life with cartilage (Fig. 8.23).\nThe other boundaries of  the foramen lacerum are the \nbasilar part of  the occipital bone medially and the body of  the sphenoid anteriorly .\nPosterolateral from the foramen lacerum along the \npetrous part of  the temporal bone is the large circular opening for the carotid canal.\nBetween the petrous part of  the temporal bone and the \ngreater wing of  the sphenoid is a groove for the cartilagi -\nnous part of  the pharyngotympanic tube (auditory \ntube).

This region is the tegmen \ntympani, and marks the thin bony roof  of  the middle  \near cavity .\nPosterior cranial fossa\nThe posterior cranial fossa consists mostly of  parts of  the temporal and occipital bones, with small contributions from the sphenoid and parietal bones (Fig. 8.27). It is the largest and deepest of  the three cranial fossae and contains the brainstem (midbrain, pons, and medulla) and the cerebellum.\nBoundaries\nThe anterior boundaries of  the posterior cranial fossa in the midline are the dorsum sellae and the clivus (Fig. \n8.27). The clivus is a slope of  bone that extends upward from the foramen magnum. It is formed by contributions from the body of  the sphenoid and from the basilar part of  the occipital bone.\nLaterally the anterior boundaries of  the posterior cranial \nfossa are the superior border of  the petrous part of  the petromastoid part of  the temporal bone.\nPosteriorly the squamous part of  the occipital bone to \nthe level of  the transverse groove is the major boundary , while laterally the petromastoid part of  the temporal bone and small parts of  the occipital and parietal bones border the fossa.\nForamen magnum\nCentrally , in the deepest part of  the posterior cranial  \nfossa, is the largest foramen in the skull, the foramen magnum. It is surrounded by the basilar part of  the occipi -\ntal bone anteriorly , the lateral parts of  the occipital bone on either side, and the squamous part of  the occipital bone posteriorly .\nThe spinal cord passes superiorly through the foramen \nmagnum to continue as the brainstem.\nAlso passing through the foramen magnum are the \nvertebral arteries, the meninges, and the spinal roots of  the accessory nerve [XI].\nGrooves and foramina\nThe clivus slopes upward from the foramen magnum. Lateral to the clivus is a groove for the inferior petrosal sinus between the basilar part of  the occipital bone and the petrous part of  the petromastoid part of  the temporal bone (Fig. 8.27).oculomotor nerve [III], the trochlear nerve [IV], the oph-thalmic nerve [V\n1], the abducent nerve [VI], and ophthal -\nmic veins.\nPosterior to the medial end of  the superior orbital fissure \non the floor of  the middle cranial fossa is a rounded foramen projecting in an anterior direction (the foramen rotun -\ndum), through which the maxillary nerve [V\n2] passes from \nthe middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa.\nPosterolateral to the foramen rotundum is a large \noval opening (the foramen ovale), which allows struc-tures to pass between the extracranial infratemporal fossa and the middle cranial fossa. The mandibular nerve [V\n3], \nlesser petrosal nerve (carrying fibers from the tympanic plexus that originally came from the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX]) and, occasionally , a small vessel (the accessory middle meningeal artery), pass through this foramen.\nPosterolateral from the foramen ovale is the small \nforamen spinosum (Fig. 8.26). This opening also connects the infratemporal fossa with the middle cranial fossa. The middle meningeal artery and its associated veins pass through this foramen and, once inside, the groove for the middle meningeal artery across the floor and lateral wall of  the middle cranial fossa clearly marks their path.\nPosteromedial to the foramen ovale is the rounded \nintracranial opening of  the carotid canal. Directly \ninferior to this opening is an irregular foramen (the foramen lacerum) (Fig. 8.26). Clearly observed in the inferior view of  the skull, the foramen lacerum is closed in life by a cartilaginous plug, and no structures pass through it completely .\nTemporal bone\nThe posterior boundary of  the middle cranial fossa is formed by the anterior surface of  the petrous part of  the petromastoid part of  the temporal bone.\nMedially , there is a slight depression ( trigeminal \nimpression) in the anterior surface of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone (Fig. 8.26), which marks the location of  the sensory ganglion for the trigeminal nerve [V].\nLateral to the trigeminal impression and on the anterior \nsurface of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone is a small linear groove that passes in a superolateral direction and ends in a foramen (the groove  and hiatus for the greater \npetrosal nerve). The greater petrosal nerve is a branch of  the facial nerve [VII].\nAnterolateral to the groove for the greater petrosal \nnerve is a second, smaller \ngroove  and hiatus for the \nlesser petrosal nerve , a branch from the tympanic plexus \ncarrying fibers that originally came from the glossopha -\nryngeal nerve [IX] (Fig. 8.26).\nAbove and lateral to the small openings for the greater \nand lesser petrosal nerves, near the superior ridge of  the"

This can result in an irregular head shape because the pattern and direction of \nskull growth are altered. In the majority of cases the cause \nis unknown, and in a minority of cases it may be caused by a genetic syndrome.\nIn the clinic\nMedical imaging of the head\nRadiography\nUntil recently, the standard method of imaging the head was \nplain radiography. The radiographs are taken in three standard projections\u2014the posteroanterior view, the lateral \nview, and the T owne\u2019s view (anteroposterior [AP] axial\u2014\nhead in anatomical position). Additional views are obtained to assess the foramina at the base of the skull and the facial bones. Currently, skull radiographs are used in cases of trauma, but such use is declining. Skull fractures are \nrelatively easily detected (Fig. 8.29). The patient is assessed \nand treatment is based upon the underlying neurological or potential neurological complications.\nComputed tomography\nSince the development of computed tomography (CT), cerebral CT has become the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of neuroradiological examination. It is ideally used for head \ninjury because the brain and its coverings can be easily and \nquickly examined and blood is easily detected. By altering the mathematical algorithm of the data set the bones can also be demonstrated.\nWith intravenous contrast, CT angiography can be used to \ndemonstrate the position and the size of an intracerebral aneurysm before endovascular treatment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unsurpassed by other imaging techniques in its ability for contrast resolution. The brain and its coverings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and \nvertebral column can be easily and quickly examined. Newer \nimaging sequences permit CSF suppression to define periventricular lesions.\nMagnetic resonance angiography has been extremely \nuseful in determining the completeness of the intracranial \nvasculature (circle of Willis), which is necessary in some \nsurgical conditions.\nMRI is also a powerful tool in the assessment of carotid \nstenosis.Ultrasonography\nIt is now possible to carry out intracranial Doppler studies, which enable a surgeon to detect whether a patient is experiencing cerebral embolization from a carotid plaque.\nExtracranial ultrasound is extremely important in tumor \nstaging and in assessing neck masses and the carotid bifurcation (Fig. 8.30).\nUltrasound is useful in children because they have an \nacoustic window through the fontanelles.\nFig. 8.29  Skull frac ture seen on a skull radiograph (patient in \nsupine position). \nSkull fracture\n(continues)"

A. Normal carotid bifurcation. B. Internal carotid artery stenosis. \nIn the clinic\nFractures of the skull vault\nThe skull vault is a remarkably strong structure because it \nprotects our most vital organ, the brain. The shape of the \nskull vault is of critical importance and its biomechanics \nprevent fracture. From a clinical standpoint skull fractures \nalert clinicians to the nature and force of an injury and \npotential complications. The fracture itself is usually of little \nconsequence (unlike, say, a fracture of the tibia). Of key \nimportance is the need to minimize the extent of primary \nbrain injury and to treat potential secondary complications, \nrather than focusing on the skull fracture. Skull fractures that \nhave particular significance include depressed skull fractures, \ncompound fractures, and pterion fractures.\nDepressed skull fractures\nIn a depressed skull fracture a bony fragment is depressed \nbelow the normal skull convexity. This may lead to \nsecondary arterial and venous damage with hematoma \nformation. A primary brain injury can also result from this \ntype of fracture.\nCompound fractures\nIn a compound fracture there is a fracture of the bone \ntogether with a breach of the skin, which may allow an infection to enter. Typically these fractures are associated \nwith scalp lacerations and can usually be treated with \nantibiotics.\nImportant complications of compound fractures include \nmeningitis, which may be fatal.\nA more subtle type of compound fracture involves \nfractures across the sinuses. These may not be appreciated \non first inspection, but are an important potential cause of \nmorbidity and should be considered in patients who develop \nintracranial infections secondary to trauma.\nPterion fractures\nThe pterion is an important clinical point on the lateral \naspect of the skull. At the pterion the frontal, parietal, \ngreater wing of the sphenoid, and temporal bones come \ntogether. Importantly, deep to this structure is the middle \nmeningeal artery. An injury to this point of the skull is \nextremely serious because damage to this vessel may \nproduce a significant extradural hematoma, which can be \nfatal."

Dural border \ncells are flattened cells surrounded by extracellular spaces filled with amorphous material. While very infrequent, an occasional cell junction may be seen between these cells and the underlying arachnoid layer. Bleeding due to the tearing of  a cerebral vein as it crosses through the dura to enter a dural venous sinus can result in a subdural hematoma.\nSubarachnoid space\nDeep to the arachnoid mater is the only normally occur -\nring fluid-filled space associated with the meninges, the subarachnoid space (Fig. 8.35). It occurs because the arachnoid mater clings to the inner surface of  the dura mater and does not follow the contour of  the brain, while the pia mater, being against the surface of  the brain, closely follows the grooves and fissures on the surface of  the brain. The narrow subarachnoid space is therefore created between these two membranes (Fig. 8.35).\nThe subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal \ncord and in certain locations it enlarges into expanded areas (subarachnoid cisterns). It contains cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) and blood vessels.\nCerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus, \nprimarily in the ventricles of  the brain. It is a clear, color -\nless, cell-free fluid that circulates through the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\nThe CSF returns to the venous system through arach-\nnoid villi . These project as clumps ( arachnoid granula-\ntions) into the superior sagittal sinus, which is a dural venous sinus, and its lateral extensions, the lateral \nlacunae (Fig. 8.35).Pia mater\nThe pia mater is a thin, delicate membrane that closely invests the surface of  the brain (Fig. 8.35). It follows the contours of  the brain, entering the grooves and fissures on its surface, and is closely applied to the roots of  the cranial nerves at their origins.\nArrangement of meninges and spaces\nThere is a unique arrangement of  meninges coupled with real and potential spaces within the cranial cavity (Fig. 8.35).\nA potential space is related to the dura mater, while a \nreal space exists between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater.\nExtradural space\nThe potential space between dura mater and bone is the extradural space (Fig. 8.35). Normally , the outer or periosteal layer of  dura mater is firmly attached to the bones surrounding the cranial cavity .\nThis potential space between dura and bone can become \na fluid-filled actual space when a traumatic event results in \na vascular hemorrhage. Bleeding into the extradural space primarily due to rupture of  a meningeal artery or less often from a torn dural venous sinus results in an extradural hematoma.\nSubdural space\nAnatomically , a true subdural space does not exist. Blood collecting in this region (subdural hematoma) due to injury represents a dissection of  the dural border cell layer, which \nIn the clinic\nHydrocephalus\nHydrocephalus is a dilation of the cerebral ventricular \nsystem, which is due to either an obstruction to the  \nflow of CSF, an overproduction of CSF, or a failure of \nreabsorption of CSF.\nCerebrospinal fluid is secreted by the choroid plexus \nwithin the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles of the brain. As \nit is produced it passes from the lateral ventricles through the interventricular foramina (the foramina of Monro) to \nenter the third ventricle. From the third ventricle it passes \nthrough the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) into the fourth ventricle, and from here it passes into the subarachnoid space via the midline foramen or the two \nlateral foramina (foramen of Magendie and foramina of \nLuschka).The CSF passes around the spinal cord inferiorly, \nenvelops the brain superiorly, and is absorbed through the \narachnoid granulations in the walls of the dural venous \nsinuses. In adults almost half a liter of CSF is produced  \nper day.\nIn adults the commonest cause of hydrocephalus is an \ninterruption of the normal CSF absorption through the \narachnoid granulations. This occurs when blood enters the \nsubarachnoid space after subarachnoid hemorrhage, passes over the brain, and interferes with normal CSF absorption. T o prevent severe hydrocephalus it may be necessary to place a small catheter through the brain into the ventricular system \nto relieve the pressure.\nOther causes of hydrocephalus include congenital \nobstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius and a variety of \n(continues)"

These procedures include \nlumbar spine surgery, epidural injection, and CSF  \naspiration.In \u201ccerebrospinal fluid leak\u201d syndrome, CSF leaks out of \nthe subarachnoid space and through the dura mater for no \napparent reason. The clinical consequences of this include \ndizziness, nausea, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth. \nOther effects also include facial nerve weakness and double \nvision.In the clinic\u2014cont\u2019d\ntumors (e.g., a midbrain tumor), where the mass obstructs \nthe aqueduct. Rare causes include choroid plexus tumors \nthat secrete CSF.\nIn children, hydrocephalus is always dramatic in its later \nstages. The hydrocephalus increases the size and dimensions \nof the ventricle, and as a result the brain enlarges. Because \nthe skull sutures are not fused, the head expands. Cranial \nenlargement in utero may make a vaginal delivery impossible, and delivery then has to be by caesarean \nsection.\nBoth CT and MRI enable a radiologist to determine the \nsite of obstruction and in most cases the cause of the \nobstruction. A distinction must be made between ventricular \nenlargement due to hydrocephalus and that due to a variety \nof other causes (e.g., cerebral atrophy).\nIn the clinic\nMeningitis\nMeningitis is a rare infection of the leptomeninges (the \nleptomeninges  are a combination of the arachnoid mater \nand the pia mater). Infection of the meninges typically \noccurs via a blood-borne route, though in some cases it may \nbe by direct spread (e.g., trauma) or from the nasal cavities \nthrough the cribriform plate in the ethmoid bone.\nCertain types of bacterial inflammation of the meninges \nare so virulent that overwhelming inflammation and sepsis \nwith cerebral irritation can cause the patient to rapidly pass \ninto a coma and die.\nMeningitis is usually treatable with antibiotics.Certain types of bacteria that produce meningitis produce \nother effects; for example, subcutaneous hemorrhage \n(ecchymoses) is a feature of meningococcal meningitis.\nThe typical history of meningitis is nonspecific at first. \nThe patient may have mild headache, fever, drowsiness, and \nnausea. As the infection progresses, photophobia (light \nintolerance) and ecchymosis may ensue. Straight leg raising \ncauses marked neck pain and discomfort (Kernig\u2019s sign) and \nan emergency hospital admission is warranted.\nImmediate treatment consists of very-high-dose \nintravenous antibiotics and supportive management.\nIn the clinic\nBrain tumors\nDetermination of the anatomical structure from which a \ntumor arises is of the utmost importance, particularly when \nit arises within the cranial vault. Misinterpretation of the \nlocation of a lesion and its site of origin may have \ndevastating consequences for the patient.\nWhen assessing any lesion in the brain, it is important to \ndefine whether it is intra-axial (within the brain) or \nextra-axial (outside the brain).\nTypical extra-axial tumors include meningiomas (tumors \nof the meninges) and acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas \ntypically arise from the meninges, with preferred sites \nincluding regions at and around the falx cerebri, the free \nedge of the tentorium cerebelli, and the anterior margin of \nthe middle cranial fossa. Acoustic neuromas are typically at and around the vestibulocochlear nerve [VIII] and in the \ncerebellopontine angle.\nIntra-axial lesions are either primary or secondary. By far \nthe commonest type are the secondary brain lesions, which \nin most cases are metastatic tumor deposits.\nMetastatic tumor lesions are typically found in patients \nwith either breast carcinoma or lung carcinoma, though many \nother malignancies can give rise to cerebral metastases.\nPrimary brain lesions are rare and range from benign \ntumors to extremely aggressive lesions with a poor \nprognosis. These tumors arise from the different cell lines and \ninclude gliomas, oligodendrocytomas, and choroid plexus \ntumors. Primary brain tumors may occur at any age, though \nthere is a small peak incidence in the first few years of life \nfollowed by a later peak in early to middle age."

This anasto -\nmotic interconnection is accomplished by:\u25a0 an anterior comm unicating artery connecting the left \nand right anterior cerebral arteries to each other, and\n\u25a0 tw o posterior communicating arteries, one on each side, \nconnecting the internal carotid artery with the posterior cerebral artery (Figs. 8.38 and 8.39).\nIn the clinic\nStroke\nA stroke, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is defined as the \ninterruption of blood flow to the brain or brainstem resulting in impaired neurological function lasting more than 24 \nhours. Neurological impairment resolving within 24 hours is \nknown as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. Based on their etiology, strokes are broadly classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are further divided into those caused by thrombotic or embolic \nphenomena. The latter is by far the commonest type of \nstroke and is often caused by emboli that originate from atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries that migrate into and block smaller intracranial vessels. Hemorrhagic \nstrokes are caused by rupture of blood vessels.\nThe risk factors for stroke are those of cardiovascular \ndisease, such as diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. In \nyounger patients underlying clotting disorders, use of oral contraceptives, and illicit substance abuse (such as cocaine) \nare additional causes.\nThe symptoms and signs of a stroke depend on the \ndistribution of impaired brain perfusion. Common \npresentations include rapid-onset hemiparesis or hemisensory loss, visual field deficits, dysarthria, ataxia, and \na decreased level of consciousness.\nStroke is a neurological emergency. It is therefore \nimportant to establish the diagnosis as early as possible so \nthat urgent and potentially life-saving treatment can be administered. Potent thrombolytic (blood-thinning) drugs can \nrestore cerebral blood flow and improved patient outcome if \nadministered within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nFollowing initial clinical history taking and neurological \nexamination, all patients with suspected stroke should undergo urgent brain imaging with computed tomography (CT). This is to identify hemorrhagic strokes for which thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated and to exclude an alternative diagnosis such as malignancy. In ischemic stroke, \nearly CT imaging may appear normal or can show a \nrelatively darker area of low density that corresponds to the region of abnormal brain perfusion. Due to subsequent brain edema and swelling, the affected brain also loses its normal sulcal pattern (Fig. 8.40A). If thrombolysis is performed, a \n24-hour follow-up CT scan is routinely carried out to evaluate \nfor complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.\nAdditional diagnostic workup of stroke includes \nhematological and biochemical blood tests to identify causes such as hypoglycemia or underlying clotting disorders. A \ntoxicology screen may be useful to identify substance \nintoxication, which can mimic stroke.\nThe full extent of neurological injury can be evaluated on \nsubsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which has better soft tissue resolution compared to CT. MRI \nis also useful for identifying strokes that may be too small to \ndetect on a CT scan. MRI scans are produced by using complicated algorithms that create a series of images, also known as sequences. Various sequences can be obtained to \nassess different anatomical and physiological properties of \nthe brain. A stroke, whether acute or chronic, will appear as a bright region on a sequence that is sensitive to fluid (T2 weighted) (Fig. 8.40B). T o identify whether a stroke is acute, further sequences are obtained, known as diffusion-weighted \nimaging (DWI) (Fig. 8.40C) and the apparent diffusion \ncoefficient (ADC) (Fig. 8.40D) map. These evaluate the diffusion of water molecules in the brain. If the region of abnormality appears bright on the DWI sequence and dark on the ADC map, this is known as restricted diffusion, which \nis compatible with an acute stroke. These changes can \npersist for up to a week after the initial insult.\nImaging of the carotid and vertebral arteries is also \nperformed to assess for any treatable atherosclerotic changes and stenosis. This can be done with ultrasound, CT, \nor less frequently, MRI.\nManagement of a stroke is multidisciplinary. Supportive \ntreatment to stabilize the patient is a priority. Stroke \nspecialists, speech and language therapists, occupational \ntherapists, and physiotherapists have key roles in patient \nrehabilitation. Long-term use of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and modification of cardiovascular disease risk factors are important in the secondary prevention of stroke.\n(continues)"

The developing plaque eventually accumulates fibrous connective tissue and calcifies. Plaque commonly occurs around vessel bifurcations, limiting blood flow, and may embolize to distal organs.\nDuring endarterectomy, plaque is removed and the  \nvessel reopened. In many instances a patch of material is sewn over the hole in the vessel, enabling improved  \nflow and preventing narrowing from the suturing of the vessel.\nIn the clinic\nIntracerebral aneurysms\nCerebral aneurysms arise from the vessels in and around the cerebral arterial circle (of Willis).

It receives a few cerebral veins and veins from the falx cerebri, and ends posteriorly at the anterior edge of  the tentorium cerebelli, where it is joined by the great cerebral vein and together with the great cerebral vein forms the straight sinus (Fig. 8.44).\nThe straight sinus continues posteriorly along the junc -\ntion of  the falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli and ends in the confluence of  sinuses, usually bending to the left to empty into the left transverse sinus.\nThe straight sinus usually receives blood from the infe -\nrior sagittal sinus, cerebral veins (from the posterior part of  the cerebral hemispheres), the great cerebral vein (draining deep areas of  the cerebral hemispheres), superior cerebellar veins, and veins from the falx cerebri.\nConfluence of  sinuses, transverse and  \nsigmoid sinuses\nThe superior sagittal and straight sinuses, and the occipital sinus (in the falx cerebelli) empty into the confluence of  sinuses, which is a dilated space at the internal occipital protuberance (Fig. 8.44) and is drained by the right and left transverse sinuses.\nThe paired transverse sinuses extend in horizontal \ndirections from the confluence of  sinuses where the tento -\nrium cerebelli joins the lateral and posterior walls of  the cranial cavity .\nThe right transverse sinus usually receives blood from \nthe superior sagittal sinus and the left transverse sinus usually receives blood from the straight sinus.\nThe transverse sinuses also receive blood from the \nsuperior petrosal sinus, veins from the inferior parts of  the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, and diploic and emissary veins.\nAs the transverse sinuses leave the surface of  the \noccipital bone, they become the sigmoid sinuses (Fig. 8.44), which turn inferiorly , grooving the parietal, temporal, \nFig. 8.45  Ca vernous sinuses. \nPituitary glandInternal carotid artery\nDura materAbducent nerve  [VI]\nMaxillary division of trigeminal nerve [V2]Cavernous (venous) sinusesSphenoidal (paranasal) sinuses\nOphthalmic division of trigeminal nerve [V1]Trochlear nerve [IV]\nOculomotor nerve [III]\nDiaphragma sellae"

Symptoms of brain TB include headache, neck stiffness, \nweight loss, and fever. Symptoms of spinal cord TB \ninclude leg weakness and fecal and urinary incontinence. Meningitis can cause altered mental status, fever, and seizures. Treatment usually requires a cocktail of drugs for 1 year, but treatment for brain TB can require 2 years.\nFig. 8.51  MRI of the brain shows peripherally enhancing \ntuberculosis lesions in the left temporal lobe and cerebral \npeduncle. \nIn the clinic\nEmissary veins\nEmissary veins connect extracranial veins with intracranial \nveins and are important clinically because they can be a conduit through which infections can enter the cranial \ncavity. Emissary veins lack valves, as do the majority of \nveins in the head and neck.In the clinic\nConcussion\nConcussion (mild traumatic brain injury [MTBI]) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. The injury typically results from a rapid deceleration of the head or \nby a rotation of the brain within the cranial cavity. General \nsymptoms of MTBI can include posttraumatic amnesia, confusion, loss of consciousness, headache, dizziness, vomiting, lack of motor coordination, and light sensitivity. The diagnosis of concussion, MTBI, is based on the event, \nthe current neurological status, and the state of \nconsciousness of the patient.\nIn the clinic\nClinical assessment of patients with head injury\nClinical assessment of patients with head injury always appears relatively straightforward. In reality it is usually far from straightforward.\nPatients may have a wide spectrum of modes of injury \nfrom a simple fall to complex multiple trauma. The age of the patient and ability to communicate about the injuries are important factors.\nThe circumstances in which the injury may have \noccurred should be documented because some head injuries result from a serious assault, and the physician may be required to give evidence to a court of law.\nDetermining the severity of head injury may be difficult \nbecause some injuries occur as a result of or in association with alcohol intoxication.\nEven when the diagnosis has been made and the correct \nmanagement has been instigated, the circumstances in which the injury occurred and the environment to which \nthe patient will return after treatment need to be reviewed \nto prevent further injuries (e.g., an elderly person tripping on loose carpet on a staircase).\nA thorough clinical examination includes all systems, but \nwith a special focus on the central and peripheral nervous \nsystems. The level of consciousness must also be assessed \nand accurately documented using the Glasgow Coma Scale, which allows clinicians to place a numerical value upon the level of consciousness so that any deterioration or improvement can be measured and quantified.\nGlasgow Coma Scale\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale was proposed in 1974 and is now widely accepted throughout the world. There is a total score of 15 points, such that 15/15 indicates that the patient \nis alert and fully oriented, whereas 3/15 indicates a severe \nand deep coma. The points score comprises a best motor response (total of 6 points), best verbal response (total of 5 points), and best eye movement response (total of 4 points)."

Whenever the brain is injured, like most \ntissues, it swells. Because the brain is encased within a fixed \nspace (the skull), swelling impairs cerebral function and has two other important effects.\n\u25a0 First , the swelling compresses the blood supply into the \nskull, resulting in a physiologically dramatic increase in blood pressure.\n\u25a0 Sec ond, the cerebral swelling may be diffuse, eventually \nsqueezing the brain and brainstem through the foramen magnum (coning). This compression and disruption of the brainstem may lead to a loss of basic cardiorespiratory function, and death will ensue. Focal cerebral edema may cause one side of the brain to herniate beneath the falx \ncerebri (falcine herniation).\nSimple measures to prevent the swelling include \nhyperventilation (which alters the intracerebral acid\u2013base \nbalance and decreases swelling) and intravenous \ncorticosteroids (though their action is often delayed).\nExtracerebral hematoma may be removed surgically.\nThe outcome of patients with head injury depends on \nhow the secondary injury is managed. Even with a severe primary injury, patients may recover to lead a normal life.\nIn the clinic\nIncreased intracranial pressure and coning\nThe skull is a closed bony compartment, and the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are maintained physiologically within a narrow intracranial pressure range. Any new space-occupying \nlesion, such as a hematoma, an injury that leads to brain \nswelling, or a brain tumor, can increase intracranial pressure and compress the brain. In severe cases, the brain may be squeezed down into the foramen magnum, giving it a cone shape, termed cerebral herniation, or \u201cconing.\u201d This may in \nturn compress the brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord, \nwhich can be fatal.\nCongenital herniation or coning of the cerebellar tonsils \nthrough the foramen magnum can also occur if the posterior \nfossa is too small, a condition known as Chiari I \nmalformation (Fig. 8.52). This often causes no problems in childhood and may only start causing symptoms in adulthood.\nFig. 8.52  MRI of the brain reveals an incidental Chiari I \nmalformation with herniation of the the cerebellar tonsils \nthrough the foramen magnum, giving rise to a cone shape. \nCerebellar tonsillar \ndescent"

It arises from the brainstem between the pons and medulla and passes forward, piercing the dura covering the clivus (Figs. 8.53 and 8.54). Continuing upward in a dural canal, it crosses the superior edge of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone, enters and crosses the cavernous sinus (see Fig. 8.45) just inferolateral to the internal carotid artery , and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure.\nFacial nerve [VII]\nThe facial nerve [VII]  carries GSA, SA, GVE, and BE \nfibers:Trigeminal nerve [V]\nThe trigeminal nerve [V]  is the major general sensory \nnerve of  the head and also innervates muscles that move the lower jaw . It carries general somatic afferent (GSA) and branchial efferent (BE) fibers:\n\u25a0 The GSA fiber s provide sensory input from the face, \nanterior one-half  of  the scalp, mucous membranes of  the oral and nasal cavities and the paranasal sinuses, the nasopharynx, part of  the ear and external acoustic meatus, part of  the tympanic membrane, the orbital contents and conjunctiva, and the dura mater in the anterior and middle cranial fossae.\n\u25a0 The BE fiber s innervate the muscles of  mastication; the \ntensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, and mylohyoid muscles; and the anterior belly of  the digastric muscle.\nThe trigeminal nerve exits from the anterolateral surface \nof  the pons as a large sensory root and a small motor root \n(Fig. 8.54). These roots continue forward out of  the poste -\nrior cranial fossa and into the middle cranial fossa by passing over the medial tip of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone (Fig. 8.53).\nIn the middle cranial fossa the sensory root expands into \nthe trigeminal ganglion (Fig. 8.53), which contains cell \nbodies for the sensory neurons in the trigeminal nerve and is comparable to a spinal ganglion. The ganglion is in a depression (the trigeminal depression) on the anterior surface of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone, in a dural cave (the trigeminal cave). The motor root is below and \ncompletely separate from the sensory root at this point.\nArising from the anterior border of  the trigeminal \nganglion are the three terminal divisions of  the trigeminal nerve, which in descending order are:\n\u25a0 the ophthalmic nerve (ophthalmic division [V 1]).\n\u25a0 the maxillary nerve (maxillary division [V 2]), and\n\u25a0 the mandibular nerve (mandibular division [V 3]).\nOphthalmic nerve [V 1]\nThe ophthalmic nerve [V 1] passes forward in the dura of  \nthe lateral wall of  the cavernous sinus (see Fig. 8.45), leaves the cranial cavity , and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure (Fig. 8.53).\nThe ophthalmic nerve [V\n1] carries sensory branches \nfrom the eyes, conjunctiva, and orbital contents, including the lacrimal gland. It also receives sensory branches from the nasal cavity , frontal sinus, ethmoidal cells, falx cerebri, dura in the anterior cranial fossa and superior parts of  the tentorium cerebelli, upper eyelid, dorsum of  the nose, and the anterior part of  the scalp."

The rootlets cross the posterior cranial fossa and enter the jugular foramen (Fig. 8.53). Within the jugular foramen, and before exiting from it, the rootlets merge to form the glossopharyngeal  \nnerve.\nWithin or immediately outside the jugular foramen are \ntwo ganglia (the superior and inferior ganglia), which contain the cell bodies of  the sensory neurons in the glos -\nsopharyngeal nerve [IX].\nTympanic nerve\nBranching from the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX] either within or immediately outside the jugular foramen is the tympanic nerve. This branch reenters the temporal  \nbone, enters the middle ear cavity , and participates in  \nthe formation of  the tympanic plexus . Within the  \nmiddle ear cavity it provides sensory innervation to the mucosa of  the cavity , pharyngotympanic tube, and mastoid air cells.\nThe tympanic nerve also contributes GVE fibers, which \nleave the tympanic plexus in the lesser petrosal nerve\u2014a \nsmall nerve that exits the temporal bone, enters the middle cranial fossa, and descends through the foramen ovale to exit the cranial cavity carrying preganglionic parasympa -\nthetic fibers to the otic ganglion (Table 8.6).\nVagus nerve [X]\nThe vagus nerve [X] carries GSA, GV A, SA, GVE, and  \nBE fibers:\n\u25a0 The GSA fiber s provide sensory input from the larynx, \nlaryngopharynx, deeper parts of  the auricle, part of  the external acoustic meatus, and the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa.\n\u25a0 The GV A fibers provide sensory input from the aortic \nbody chemoreceptors and aortic arch baroreceptors, and the esophagus, bronchi, lungs, heart, and abdomi -\nnal viscera in the foregut and midgut.\n\u25a0 The SA fiber s are for taste around the epiglottis and \npharynx.\n\u25a0 The GVE fibers are part of  the parasympathetic part of  \nthe autonomic division of  the PNS and stimulate smooth muscle and glands in the pharynx, larynx, thoracic viscera, and abdominal viscera of  the foregut and midgut.\n\u25a0 The BE fiber s innervate one muscle of  the tongue (pala -\ntoglossus), the muscles of  the soft palate (except the tensor veli palatini), pharynx (except the stylopharyn -\ngeus), and larynx.The vagus nerve arises as a group of  rootlets on the \nanterolateral surface of  the medulla oblongata just inferior to the rootlets arising to form the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX] (Fig. 8.54). The rootlets cross the posterior cranial fossa and enter the jugular foramen (Fig. 8.53). Within this foramen, and before exiting from it, the rootlets merge to form the vagus nerve [X]. Within or immedi -\nately outside the jugular foramen are two ganglia, the superior (jugular) and inferior (nodose) ganglia, which contain the cell bodies of  the sensory neurons in the vagus  \nnerve [X].\nAccessory nerve [XI]\nThe accessory nerve [XI] is a cranial nerve that carries BE fibers to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles (see Diogo R et al. Nature 2015;520:466\u2013473). It is a unique cranial nerve because its roots arise from motor neurons in the upper five segments of  the cervical spinal cord. These fibers leave the lateral surface of  the spinal cord and, joining together as they ascend, enter the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum (Fig. 8.54). The accessory nerve [XI] continues through the posterior cranial fossa and exits through the jugular foramen (Fig. 8.53). It then descends in the neck to innervate the ster -\nnocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles from their deep surfaces.\nCranial root of the accessory nerve\nSome descriptions of  the accessory nerve [XI] refer to a few rootlets arising from the caudal part of  the medulla oblongata on the anterolateral surface just inferior to the rootlets arising to form the vagus nerve [X] as the \u201ccranial\u201d root of  the accessory nerve (Fig. 8.54). Leaving the medulla, the cranial roots course with the \u201cspinal\u201d roots of  the accessory nerve [XI] into the jugular foramen, at which point the cranial roots join the vagus nerve [X]. As part of  the vagus nerve [X], they are distributed to the pharyngeal musculature innervated by the vagus nerve [X] and are therefore described as being part of  the vagus nerve [X].\nHypoglossal nerve [XII]\nThe hypoglossal nerve [XII] carries GSE fibers to innervate all intrinsic muscles and most of  the extrinsic muscles of  the tongue. It arises as several rootlets from the anterior surface of  the medulla (Fig. 8.54), passes laterally across the posterior cranial fossa, and exits through the hypoglos -\nsal canal (Fig. 8.53). This nerve innervates the hyoglossus, styloglossus, and genioglossus muscles and all intrinsic muscles of  the tongue."

As these branches pass through the substance of  the parotid gland they may branch further or take part in an anastomotic network (the parotid plexus).\nWhatever types of  interconnections occur, five terminal \ngroups of  branches of  the facial nerve [VII]\u2014the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches\u2014emerge from the parotid gland (Fig. 8.66A).\nAlthough there are variations in the pattern of  distribu -\ntion of  the five terminal groups of  branches, the basic pattern is as follows:\n\u25a0 T emporal branches exit from the superior border of  the \nparotid gland to supply muscles in the area of  the temple, forehead, and supra-orbital area.\n\u25a0 Zy gomatic branches emerge from the anterosuperior \nborder of  the parotid gland to supply muscles in the infra-orbital area, the lateral nasal area, and the  \nupper lip.\n\u25a0 Buccal br anches emerge from the anterior border of  the \nparotid gland to supply muscles in the cheek, the upper lip, and the corner of  the mouth.\n\u25a0 Marginal mandibular branches emerge from the \nanteroinferior border of  the parotid gland to supply muscles of  the lower lip and chin.\n\u25a0 Cer vical branches emerge from the inferior border of  \nthe parotid gland to supply the platysma.\nVessels\nThe arterial supply to the face is primarily from branches of  the external carotid artery , though there is some limited supply from a branch of  the internal carotid artery .\nSimilarly , most of  the venous return is back to the \ninternal jugular vein, though some important connections from the face result in venous return through a clinically relevant intracranial pathway involving the cavernous sinus.Mandibular nerve [V 3]\nThe mandibular nerve [V 3] exits the skull through the \nforamen ovale. Branches (Fig. 8.65) innervating the face include:\n\u25a0 the auriculotemporal nerve, which enters the face  \njust posterior to the temporomandibular joint, passes through the parotid gland, and ascends just anterior to the ear to supply the external acoustic meatus, the surface of  the tympanic membrane (eardrum), and a large area of  the temple;\n\u25a0 the buccal nerve, which is on the surface of  the buc -\ncinator muscle supplying the cheek; and\n\u25a0 the mental nerve, which exits the mandible through \nthe mental foramen and immediately divides into mul -\ntiple branches to supply the skin and mucous membrane of  the lower lip and skin of  the chin (Fig. 8.65).\nMotor innervation\nThe muscles of  the face, as well as those associated with the external ear and the scalp, are derived from the second pharyngeal arch. The cranial nerve associated with this arch is the facial nerve [VII] and therefore branches of  the facial nerve [VII] innervate all these muscles.\nThe facial nerve [VII] exits the posterior cranial fossa \nthrough the internal acoustic meatus. It passes through the temporal bone, giving off  several branches, and emerges from the base of  the skull through the stylomastoid foramen (Fig. 8.66). At this point it gives off  the posterior auricu-\nlar nerve. This branch passes upward, behind the ear, to supply the occipital belly of  the occipitofrontalis muscle of  the scalp and the posterior auricular muscle of  the ear.\nThe main stem of  the facial nerve [VII] then gives off  \nanother branch, which innervates the posterior belly of  the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle. At this point, the facial nerve [VII] enters the deep surface of  the parotid gland (Fig. 8.66B)."

These vessels arise from the ophthalmic artery, a branch of  the inter -\nnal carotid artery , after the ophthalmic artery enters  \nthe orbit:\n\u25a0 The zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal \narteries come from the lacrimal branch of  the ophthal-mic artery (Fig. 8.67), enter the face through the  \nzygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal foramina, and supply the area of  the face over the zygomatic  \nbone.\n\u25a0 The dorsal nasal artery, a terminal branch of  the \nophthalmic artery , exits the orbit in the medial corner, and supplies the dorsum of  the nose.\n\u25a0 The supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries \nsupply the anterior scalp.\nVeins\nFacial vein\nThe facial vein is the major vein draining the face (Fig. 8.67). Its point of  origin is near the medial corner of  the orbit as the supratrochlear and supra-orbital veins \ncome together to form the angular vein. This vein becomes \nthe facial vein as it proceeds inferiorly and assumes a posi -\ntion just posterior to the facial artery . The facial vein descends across the face with the facial artery until it reaches the inferior border of  the mandible. Here the artery and vein part company and the facial vein passes superficial to the submandibular gland to enter the internal jugular vein.\nThroughout its course the facial vein receives tributar -\nies from veins draining the eyelids, external nose, lips, cheek, and chin that accompany the various branches of  the facial artery .The labial branches arise near the corner of  the mouth:\n\u25a0 The inferior labial branch supplies the lower lip.\n\u25a0 The superior labial branch  supplies the upper lip, and \nalso provides a branch to the nasal septum.\nNear the midline, the superior and inferior labial \nbranches anastomose with their companion arteries from \nthe opposite side of  the face. This provides an important connection between the facial arteries and the external carotid arteries of  opposite sides.\nThe lateral nasal branch is a small branch arising \nfrom the facial artery as it passes along the side of  the nose. It supplies the lateral surface and dorsum of  the nose.\nTransverse facial artery\nAnother contributor to the vascular supply of  the face is the transverse facial artery (Fig. 8.67), which is a branch of  the superficial temporal artery (the smaller of  the two terminal branches of  the external carotid artery).\nThe transverse facial artery arises from the superficial \ntemporal artery within the substance of  the parotid gland, passes through the gland, and crosses the face in a trans-verse direction. Lying on the superficial surface of  the masseter muscle, it is between the zygomatic arch and the parotid duct.\nBranches of  the maxillary artery\nThe maxillary artery , the larger of  the two terminal branches of  the external carotid artery , gives off  several small branches which contribute to the arterial supply to the face:\n\u25a0 The infra-orbital artery enters the face through the \ninfra-orbital foramen and supplies the lower eyelid, upper lip, and the area between these structures.\n\u25a0 The buccal artery enters the face on the superficial \nsurface of  the buccinator muscle and supplies structures in this area."

It empties into the superficial temporal vein within the substance of  the parotid gland.\nIntracranial venous connections\nAs it crosses the face, the facial vein has numerous connec -\ntions with venous channels passing into deeper regions of  the head (Fig. 8.68):\n\u25a0 near the medial cor ner of  the orbit, it communicates \nwith ophthalmic veins;\n\u25a0 in the area of  the cheek it communicates with veins \npassing into the infra-orbital foramen;\n\u25a0 it also comm unicates with veins passing into deeper \nregions of  the face (i.e., the deep facial vein connecting with the pterygoid plexus of  veins).\nAll these venous channels have interconnections with \nthe intracranial cavernous sinus through emissary veins \nthat connect intracranial with extracranial veins. There are no valves in the facial vein or any other venous channels in the head, so blood can move in any direction. Because of  the interconnections between the veins, infec-tions of  the face, primarily above the mouth (i.e., the \u201cdanger area\u201d) should be handled with great care to prevent the dissemination of  infectious material in an intracranial direction.\nLymphatic drainage\nLymphatic drainage from the face primarily moves toward three groups of  lymph nodes (Fig. 8.69):\n\u25a0 submental nodes inferior and posterior to the chin, which drain lymphatics from the medial part of  the lower lip and chin bilaterally;\n\u25a0 submandibular nodes superficial to the submandibu -\nlar gland and inferior to the body of  the mandible, which drain the lymphatics from the medial corner of  the orbit, most of  the external nose the medial part of  the cheek, the upper lip, and the lateral part of  the lower lip that follows the course of  the facial artery;\n\u25a0 pre-auricular and parotid nodes anterior to the  \near, which drain lymphatics from most of  the eyelids,  \na part of  the external nose, and the lateral part of   \nthe cheek."

It enters the internal acoustic meatus, passes to the \ngeniculate ganglion (which gives rise to further branches), \nand emerges from the skull base after a complex course \nwithin the temporal bone, leaving through the stylomastoid \nforamen. It enters the parotid gland and gives rise to five \nterminal groups of branches that supply muscles in the face \nand a number of additional branches that supply deeper or \nmore posterior muscles. A series of lesions may affect the \nnerve along its course, and it is possible, with good clinical \nexpertise, to determine the exact site of the lesion in relation \nto the course of the nerve.\nCentral lesions\nA primary brainstem lesion affecting the motor nucleus of \nthe facial nerve [VII] would lead to ipsilateral (same side) \nweakness of the whole face. However, because the upper \npart of the nucleus receives motor input from the left and \nright cerebral hemispheres a lesion occurring above the \nnucleus leads to contralateral lower facial weakness. In this example, motor innervation to the upper face is spared \nbecause the upper part of the nucleus receives input from \nboth hemispheres. Preservation and loss of the special \nfunctions are determined by the extent of the lesion.\nLesions at and around the geniculate ganglion\nTypically lesions at and around the geniculate ganglion are \naccompanied by loss of motor function on the whole of the \nipsilateral (same) side of the face. Taste to the anterior \ntwo-thirds of the tongue, lacrimation, and some salivation \nalso are likely to be affected because the lesion is proximal \nto the greater petrosal and chorda tympani branches of the \nnerve.\nLesions at and around the stylomastoid foramen\nLesions at and around the stylomastoid foramen are the \ncommonest abnormality of the facial nerve [VII] and usually \nresult from a viral inflammation of the nerve within the bony \ncanal before exiting through the stylomastoid foramen. \nTypically the patient has an ipsilateral loss of motor function \nof the whole side of the face. Not only does this produce an \nunusual appearance, but it also complicates chewing of food. \nLacrimation and taste may not be affected if the lesion \nremains distal to the greater petrosal and chorda tympani \nbranches that originate deep in the temporal bone.\nIn the clinic\nTrigeminal neuralgia\nTrigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is a complex sensory \ndisorder of the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve. \nTypically the pain is in the region of the mandibular [V 3] and \nmaxillary [V 2] nerves, and is usually of sudden onset, is \nexcruciating in nature, and may be triggered by touching a \nsensitive region of skin.\nThe etiology of trigeminal neuralgia is unknown, \nalthough anomalous blood vessels lying adjacent to the sensory route of the maxillary [V 2] and mandibular [V 3] \nnerves may be involved.\nIf symptoms persist and are unresponsive to medical care, \nsurgical exploration of the trigeminal nerve (which is not \nwithout risk) may be necessary to remove any aberrant \nvessels."

Associated with the tarsus in the upper eyelid is the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (Fig. 8.80), which raises the eyelid. Its origin is from  \nthe posterior part of  the roof  of  the orbit, just superior to the optic foramen, and it inserts into the anterior surface of  the superior tarsus, with the possibility of  a few fibers attaching to the skin of  the upper eyelid. It is innervated by the oculomotor nerve [III].\nIn companion with the levator palpebrae superioris \nmuscle is a collection of  smooth muscle fibers passing from the inferior surface of  the levator to the upper edge of  the superior tarsus (see Fig. 8.77). Innervated by postgangli -\nonic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion, this muscle is the superior tarsal muscle .\nLoss of  function of  either the levator palpebrae superi -\noris muscle or the superior tarsal muscle results in a ptosis or drooping of  the upper eyelid.\nConjunctiva\nThe structure of  the eyelid is completed by a thin mem -\nbrane (the conjunctiva), which covers the posterior \nsurface of  each eyelid (see Fig. 8.77). This membrane covers the full extent of  the posterior surface of  each eyelid before reflecting onto the outer surface (sclera) of  the eyeball. It attaches to the eyeball at the junction between the sclera and the cornea. With this membrane in place, a conjunctival sac is formed when the eyelids are closed, and the upper and lower extensions of  this sac are the superior and inferior conjunctival fornices (Fig. 8.77).\nGlands\nEmbedded in the tarsal plates are tarsal glands (see Fig. 8.77), which empty onto the free margin of  each eyelid. These glands are modified sebaceous glands and secrete an oily substance that increases the viscosity of  the tears and decreases the rate of  evaporation of  tears from the surface of  the eyeball.

However, these muscles do not act in isolation. They work as teams of  muscles in the coordinated movement of  the eyeball to position the pupil as needed.\nFor example, although the lateral rectus is the muscle \nprimarily responsible for moving the eyeball laterally , it is assisted in this action by the superior and inferior oblique muscles.Contraction of  medial rectus adducts the eyeball, whereas contraction of  lateral rectus abducts the eyeball (Fig. 8.97A).\nThe inferior branch of  the oculomotor nerve [III] inner -\nvates the medial rectus, and the abducent nerve [VI] innervates the lateral rectus.\nTo isolate the function of  and test the medial and lateral \nrectus muscles, a patient is asked to track a physician\u2019s finger medially and laterally , respectively , in the horizontal plane (Fig. 8.97B) .\nOblique muscles\nThe oblique muscles are in the superior and inferior parts of  the orbit, do not originate from the common tendinous ring, are angular in their approaches to the eyeball, and, unlike the rectus muscles, attach to the posterior half  of  the eyeball (Table 8.8).\nSuperior oblique\nThe superior oblique arises from the body of  the sphenoid, superior and medial to the optic canal and medial to the origin of  the levator palpebrae superioris (Figs. 8.95 and 8.96). It passes forward, along the medial border of  the roof  of  the orbit, until it reaches a fibrocartilaginous pulley (the trochlea), which is attached to the trochlear fovea of  \nthe frontal bone.\nThe tendon of  the superior oblique passes through the \ntrochlea and turns laterally to cross the eyeball in a pos -\nterolateral direction. It continues deep to the superior rectus muscle and inserts into the outer posterior quadrant of  the eyeball.\nContraction of  the superior oblique therefore directs the \npupil down and out (Fig. 8.97A).\nThe trochlear nerve [IV] innervates the superior oblique \nalong its superior surface.\nTo isolate the function of  and to test the superior oblique \nmuscle, a patient is asked to track a physician\u2019s finger medi -\nally to bring the axis of  the tendon of  the muscle into \nIn the clinic\nExamination of the eye\nExamination of the eye includes assessment of the visual \ncapabilities, the extrinsic musculature and its function, and disease processes that may affect the eye in isolation or as \npart of the systemic process.\nExamination of the eye includes tests for visual acuity, \nastigmatism, visual fields, and color interpretation (to \nexclude color blindness) in a variety of circumstances. The physician also assesses the retina, the optic nerve and its \ncoverings, the lens, and the cornea.The extrinsic muscles are supplied by the abducent nerve \n[VI], the trochlear nerve [IV], and the oculomotor nerve [III].\nThe extrinsic muscles work synergistically to provide \nappropriate and conjugate eye movement:\n\u25a0 la teral rectus\u2014abducent nerve [VI],\n\u25a0 superior oblique\u2014tr ochlear nerve [IV], and\n\u25a0 r emainder\u2014oculomotor nerve [III].\nThe eye may be affected in systemic diseases.

Poste -\nriorly , it leaves the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and enters the cavernous sinus.\nThe inferior ophthalmic vein is smaller than the \nsuperior ophthalmic vein, begins anteriorly , and passes across the inferior part of  the orbit. It receives various tributaries from muscles and the posterior part of  the eyeball as it crosses the orbit.\nThe inferior ophthalmic vein leaves the orbit posteriorly \nby:\n\u25a0 joining with the superior ophthalmic v ein,\n\u25a0 passing through the superior orbital fissure on its o wn \nto join the cavernous sinus, or\n\u25a0 passing through the inf erior orbital fissure to join with \nthe pterygoid plexus of  veins in the infratemporal fossa.\nBecause the ophthalmic veins communicate with the \ncavernous sinus, they act as a route by which infections \ncan spread from outside to inside the cranial cavity .\nInnervation\nNumerous nerves pass into the orbit and innervate struc -\ntures within its bony walls. They include the optic nerve [II], the oculomotor nerve [III], the trochlear nerve [IV], the abducent nerve [VI], and autonomic nerves. Other nerves such as the ophthalmic nerve [V\n1] innervate orbital \nstructures and then travel out of  the orbit to innervate other regions.\nOptic nerve\nThe optic nerve [II] is not a true cranial nerve, but rather an extension of  the brain carrying afferent fibers from the retina of  the eyeball to the visual centers of  the brain. The \noptic nerve is surrounded by the cranial meninges, includ -\ning the subarachnoid space, which extends as far forward as the eyeball.\nAny increase in intracranial pressure therefore results \nin increased pressure in the subarachnoid space surround-ing the optic nerve. This may impede venous return along the retinal veins, causing edema of  the optic disc (papille -\ndema), which can be seen when the retina is examined using an ophthalmoscope.\nThe optic nerve leaves the orbit through the optic canal \n(Fig. 8.101). It is accompanied in the optic canal by the ophthalmic artery .Oculomotor nerve\nThe oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the anterior surface of  the brainstem between the midbrain and the pons. It passes forward in the lateral wall of  the cavernous sinus.\nJust before entering the orbit the oculomotor nerve  \n[III] divides into superior and inferior branches (Fig.  \n8.102). These branches enter the orbit through the supe -\nrior orbital fissure, lying within the common tendinous ring (Fig. 8.101).\nInside the orbit the small superior branch passes upward \nover the lateral side of  the optic nerve to innervate the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris muscles (Fig. 8.102).Fig. 8.101  Inner vation of the orbit and eyeball. \nLacrimal branch of ophthalmic nerve [V1]\nNasociliary branch\nof ophthalmic nerve [V1]Frontal branch of ophthalmic nerve [V1]\nOptic nerve\nOptic canal\nInferior ophthalmic vein\nSuperior ophthalmic vei nOphthalmic artery\nInferior branch of \noculomotor nerve [III]Superior branch of \noculomotor nerve [III]\nAbducent nerve [VI]Trochlear nerve [IV]\nCommon tendinous ring\nLateral Medial\nFig. 8.102  Oculomot or nerve [III] and its divisions. \nLevator palpebrae superioris\nSuperior rectus\nMedial rectus\nCiliary ganglion\nInferior oblique\nInferior rectusInferior branch\nOculomotor nerve [III]Superior branch"

This is the parasympathetic root to \nthe ciliary ganglion and carries preganglionic parasympa -\nthetic fibers that will synapse in the ciliary ganglion with \npostganglionic parasympathetic fibers. The postganglionic fibers are distributed to the eyeball through short ciliary nerves and innervate the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscles.\nTrochlear nerve\nThe trochlear nerve [IV] arises from the posterior surface of  the midbrain, and passes around the midbrain to enter the edge of  the tentorium cerebelli. It continues on an intradural path arriving in and passing through the lateral wall of  the cavernous sinus just below the oculomotor nerve [III].\nJust before entering the orbit, the trochlear nerve \nascends, passing across the oculomotor nerve [III] and entering the orbit through the superior orbital fissure above the common tendinous ring (Fig. 8.101). In the orbit the trochlear nerve [IV] ascends and turns medially , crossing above the levator palpebrae superioris muscle to enter the upper border of  the superior oblique muscle (Fig. 8.103).\nAbducent nerve\nThe abducent nerve [VI] arises from the brainstem between the pons and medulla. It enters the dura covering the clivus and continues in a dural canal until it reaches the cavern -\nous sinus.\nThe abducent nerve enters the cavernous sinus and \nruns through the sinus lateral to the internal carotid artery . It passes out of  the sinus and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure within the common tendinous ring (Fig. 8.101). Once in the orbit it courses laterally to supply the lateral rectus muscle.\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers\nPreganglionic sympathetic fibers arise from the upper  \nsegments of  the thoracic spinal cord, mainly T1. They enter the sympathetic chain through white rami commu-nicantes, and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion where they synapse with postganglionic sympathetic fibers.\nThe postganglionic fibers are distributed along the \ninternal carotid artery and its branches.\nThe postganglionic sympathetic fibers destined for the \norbit travel with the ophthalmic artery . Once in the orbit the fibers are distributed to the eyeball either by:\n\u25a0 passing through the ciliary ganglion, without synaps -\ning, and joining the short ciliary nerves, which pass from the ganglion to the eyeball; or\n\u25a0 passing through long ciliar y nerves to reach the  \neyeball.\nIn the eyeball postganglionic sympathetic fibers inner -\nvate the dilator pupillae muscle.\nOphthalmic nerve [V 1]\nThe ophthalmic nerve [V 1] is the smallest and most supe -\nrior of  the three divisions of  the trigeminal nerve.

It is most deeply placed in the orbit, entering the area within the common tendinous ring between the superior and inferior branches of  the oculomotor nerve [III] (see Fig. 8.101).(Fig. 8.104). These branches enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure with the frontal and lacrimal nerves outside the common tendinous ring, and the nasociliary nerve within the common tendinous ring (Fig. 8.101).\nLacrimal nerve\nThe lacrimal nerve is the smallest of  the three branches of  the ophthalmic nerve [V\n1].

It is associated with the naso -\nciliary branch of  the ophthalmic nerve [V 1] and is the site \nwhere preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons synapse as fibers from this part of  the autonomic division of  the PNS make their way to the eyeball. The ciliary ganglion is also traversed by postganglionic sympa -\nthetic fibers and sensory fibers as they travel to the eyeball.\nThe ciliary ganglion is a very small ganglion, in the \nposterior part of  the orbit immediately lateral to the optic nerve and between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle (Fig. 8.106). It is usually described as receiving at least two, and possibly three, branches or roots from other nerves in the orbit.\nParasympathetic root\nAs the inferior branch of  the oculomotor nerve [III] passes the area of  the ciliary ganglion, it sends a branch to the ganglion (the parasympathetic root). The parasympathetic branch carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers, which enter the ganglion and synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers within the ganglion (Fig. 8.107).\nThe postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the \nganglion through short ciliary nerves, which enter the posterior aspect of  the eyeball around the optic nerve.\nIn the eyeball the parasympathetic fibers innervate:\n\u25a0 the sphincter pupillae muscle, responsible for pupil -\nlary constriction, and\n\u25a0 the ciliary muscle, responsible for accommodation of  \nthe lens of  the eye for near vision.Once in the orbit, the nasociliary nerve crosses the \nsuperior surface of  the optic nerve as it passes in a medial direction below the superior rectus muscle (Figs. 8.104 and 8.106). Its first branch, the communicating branch \nwith the ciliary ganglion (sensory root to the ciliary ganglion), is given off  early in its path through the orbit.\nThe nasociliary nerve continues forward along the \nmedial wall of  the orbit, between the superior oblique and the medial rectus muscles, giving off  several branches (Fig. 8.106). These include:\n\u25a0 the long ciliary nerves, which are sensory to the \neyeball but may also contain sympathetic fibers for pupillary dilation;\n\u25a0 the posterior ethmoidal nerve, which exits the orbit \nthrough the posterior ethmoidal foramen to supply posterior ethmoidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus;\n\u25a0 the infratrochlear nerve, which distributes to the \nmedial part of  the upper and lower eyelids, the lacrimal sac, and skin of  the upper half  of  the nose; and\n\u25a0 the anterior ethmoidal nerve, which exits the orbit \nthrough the anterior ethmoidal foramen to supply the \nFig. 8.106  C ourse of the nasociliary nerve (from [V 1]) in the orbit. \nLong ciliary nerves\nShort ciliary nerves\nLacrimal gland\nLacrimal nerve \n(from [V1])\nLateral rectus \nCiliary ganglion\nAbducent nerve\n[VI]\nInferior branch of \nthe oculomotor nerve [III]\nSuperior branch \nof the oculomotor \nnerve [III]Medial rectus muscle\nNasociliary \nnerve (from [V1])Posterior ethmoidal nerve\nAnterior ethmoidal nerve\nInfratrochlear nerve\nLateral\nFig. 8.107  Ciliar y ganglion. \nNasociliary nerve\nLong ciliary nerve\nShort ciliary nerveCiliary ganglionParasympathetic (motor) root\nOculomotor nerve [III]Sympathetic\n rootSensory root\nSensory fibers\nSympathetic postganglionic fibersParasympathetic preganglionic fibers\nParasympathetic postganglionic fibers"

In addition, the sympathetic fibers carried in the nasociliary nerve may not enter the ganglion at all and may course directly into the eyeball in the long ciliary nerves (Fig. 8.107). Whatever their path, postganglionic sympathetic fibers reach the eyeball and innervate the dilator pupillae muscle.\nEyeball\nThe globe-shaped eyeball occupies the anterior part of  the orbit. Its rounded shape is disrupted anteriorly , where it bulges outward. This outward projection represents about one-sixth of  the total area of  the eyeball and is the trans-parent cornea (Fig. 8.108).\nPosterior to the cornea and in order from front to back \nare the anterior chamber, the iris and pupil, the posterior chamber, the lens, the postremal (vitreous) chamber, and the retina.\nAnterior and posterior chambers\nThe anterior chamber is the area directly posterior to the \ncornea and anterior to the colored part of  the eye ( iris). \nThe central opening in the iris is the pupil.

Four large veins (the vorticose veins) are involved in this process. They exit through the sclera from each of  the posterior quadrants of  the eyeball and enter the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. There is also a central retinal vein accompanying the central retinal artery .iris and anterior to the lens is the smaller posterior \nchamber.\nThe anterior and posterior chambers are continuous \nwith each other through the pupillary opening. They are filled with a fluid ( aqueous humor), which is secreted into \nthe posterior chamber, flows into the anterior chamber through the pupil, and is absorbed into the scleral venous \nsinus (the canal of  Schlemm), which is a circular venous channel at the junction between the cornea and the iris (Fig. 8.108).\nThe aqueous humor supplies nutrients to the avascular \ncornea and lens and maintains the intra-ocular pressure. \nIf  the normal cycle of  its production and absorption is disturbed so that the amount of  fluid increases, intra-\nocular pressure will increase. This condition (glaucoma) can lead to a variety of  visual problems.\nLens and vitreous humor\nThe lens separates the anterior one-fifth of  the eyeball \nfrom the posterior four-fifths (Fig. 8.108). It is a transpar -\nent, biconvex elastic disc attached circumferentially to muscles associated with the outer wall of  the eyeball. This lateral attachment provides the lens with the ability to change its refractive ability to maintain visual acuity . The \nclinical term for opacity of  the lens is a cataract.\nThe posterior four-fifths of  the eyeball, from the lens to \nthe retina, is occupied by the postremal (vitreous) chamber (Fig. 8.108). This segment is filled with a transparent, gelatinous substance\u2014the vitreous body (vitreous \nhumor). This substance, unlike aqueous humor, cannot be replaced.\nWalls of the eyeball\nSurrounding the internal components of  the eyeball are the walls of  the eyeball. They consist of  three layers: an outer fibrous layer, a middle vascular layer, and an inner retinal layer (Fig. 8.108).\n\u25a0 The outer fibrous la yer consists of  the sclera posteriorly \nand the cornea anteriorly .\n\u25a0 The mid dle vascular layer consists of  the choroid pos-\nteriorly and is continuous with the ciliary body and iris anteriorly .\n\u25a0 The inner layer consists of  the optic part of  the retina \nposteriorly and the nonvisual retina that covers the internal surface of  the ciliary body and iris anteriorly .In the clinic\nGlaucoma\nIntraocular pressure will rise if the normal cycle of \naqueous humor fluid production and absorption is disturbed so that the amount of fluid increases. This \ncondition is glaucoma and can lead to a variety of visual \nproblems including blindness, which results from compression of the retina and its blood supply.\nIn the clinic\nCataracts\nWith increasing age and in certain disease states the lens of the eye becomes opaque. Increasing opacity results in increasing visual impairment. A common operation is \nexcision of the cloudy lens and replacement with a new \nman-made lens."

The junction between these parts is an irregular line (the ora serrata).\nOptic part of  the retina\nThe optic part of  the retina consists of  two layers, an outer pigmented layer and an inner neural layer:\n\u25a0 The pigmented layer is firmly attached to the choroid \nand continues anteriorly over the internal surface of  the ciliary body and iris.\n\u25a0 The neural layer, which can be further subdivided into \nits various neural components, is only attached to the pigmented layer around the optic nerve and at the ora serrata.\nIt is the neural layer that separates in the case of  a \ndetached retina.\nSeveral obvious features are visible on the posterior \nsurface of  the optic part of  the retina.\nThe optic disc is where the optic nerve leaves the retina \n(Fig. 8.109). It is lighter than the surrounding retina and \nbranches of  the central retinal artery spread from this point outward to supply the retina. As there are no light- sensitive receptor cells in the optic disc, it is referred to as a blind spot in the retina.\nLateral to the optic disc a small area with a hint of  yel -\nlowish coloration is the macula lutea with its central \ndepression, the fovea centralis (Fig. 8.109). This is the \nthinnest area of  the retina and visual sensitivity here is higher than elsewhere in the retina because it has fewer rods (light-sensitive receptor cells that function in dim light and are insensitive to color) and more cones (light-\nsensitive receptor cells that respond to bright light and are sensitive to color).\nIn the clinic\nHigh-definition optical coherence tomography\nHigh-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) (Fig. \n8.111) is a procedure used to obtain subsurface images of translucent or opaque materials. It is similar to ultrasound, \nexcept that it uses light instead of sound to produce \nhigh-resolution cross-sectional images. It is especially useful in the diagnosis and management of optic nerve and retinal diseases.Epiretinal membrane\nAn epiretinal membrane (Fig. 8.112) is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue that develops on the surface of the retina in the area of the macula and can cause visual problems. If the visual \nproblems are significant, surgical removal of the membrane \nmay be necessary."

At the most superior extent of  this line of  attach -\nment a small bulge in the membrane marks the position of  the lateral process of  the malleus as it projects  \nagainst the internal surface of  the tympanic membrane. Extending away from this elevation, on the internal surface of  the membrane, are the anterior and posterior \nmalleolar folds. Superior to these folds the tympanic membrane is thin and slack (the pars flaccida), whereas \nthe rest of  the membrane is thick and taut (the pars \ntensa).\nInnervation\nInnervation of  the external and internal surfaces of  the tympanic membrane is by several cranial nerves:\n\u25a0 Sensor y innervation of  the skin on the outer surface of  \nthe tympanic membrane is primarily by the auriculo -\ntemporal nerve, a branch of  the mandibular nerve [V 3] \nwith additional participation of  the auricular branch of  the vagus nerve [X], a small contribution by a branch of  the facial nerve [VII] to the auricular branch of  the vagus nerve [X], and possibly a contribution from the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX].\n\u25a0 Sensor y innervation of  the mucous membrane on the \ninner surface of  the tympanic membrane is carried entirely by the glossopharyngeal [IX] nerve.In the clinic\nExamination of the ear\nThe ear comprises three components\u2014the external, \nmiddle, and internal ear.\nClinical examination is carried out to assess hearing \nand balance. Further examination involves use of an otoscope or other imaging techniques.\nExternal ear\nThe external ear is easily examined. The external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane require otoscopic examination (Fig. 8.118B). An otoscope is a device through \nwhich light can be shone and the image magnified to \ninspect the external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane.\nThe examination begins by grasping the \nposterosuperior aspect of the ear and gently retracting it \nto straighten the external auditory meatus. The normal \ntympanic membrane is relatively translucent and has a gray\u2013reddish tinge. The handle of the malleus is visible near the center of the membrane. In the 5 o\u2019clock position \na cone of light is always demonstrated.\nMiddle and inner ears\nThe middle ear is investigated by CT and MRI to visualize \nthe malleus, incus, and stapes. The relationship of these bones to the middle ear cavity is determined and any \nmasses identified.\nThe inner ear is also assessed by CT and MRI.In the clinic\nOtitis media\nThe eustachian tube links the middle ear and pharynx and \nbalances the pressure between the outer and middle ear. Colds and allergies, particularly in children, can result in \nswelling of the lining of the eustachian tube, which can \nthen impair normal drainage of fluid from the middle ear. The fluid then builds up behind the tympanic membrane, providing an attractive environment for bacteria and viruses to grow and cause otitis media. Left untreated, \notitis media can lead to perforation of the tympanic \nmembrane, hearing loss, meningitis, and brain abscess."

Its basic function is to transmit \nvibrations of  the tympanic membrane across the cavity of  the middle ear to the internal ear. It accomplishes this through three interconnected but movable bones that bridge the space between the tympanic membrane and the internal ear. These bones are the malleus (connected to the tympanic membrane), the incus (connected to the malleus by a synovial joint), and the stapes (connected to the incus by a synovial joint, and attached to the lateral wall of  the internal ear at the oval window).\nMiddle ear\nThe middle ear is an air-filled, mucous membrane\u2013lined space in the temporal bone between the tympanic mem -\nbrane laterally and the lateral wall of  the internal ear medi -\nally .

Because the chorda \ntympani runs in the upper one-third of the tympanic \nmembrane, incisions are always below this level. The richer blood supply to the posterior aspect of the tympanic membrane determines the standard surgical \napproach in the posteroinferior aspect.\nOtitis media (infection of the middle ear) is common \nand can lead to perforation of the tympanic membrane. \nThe infection can usually be treated with antibiotics.

These are the two sacs (the utricle and the saccule) and three ducts (the anterior, posterior, and lateral semicircular ducts).\nUtricle, saccule, and endolymphatic duct\nThe utricle is the larger of  the two sacs. It is oval, elongated and irregular in shape and is in the posterosuperior part of  the vestibule of  the bony labyrinth.\nThe three semicircular ducts empty into the utricle. \nEach semicircular duct is similar in shape, including a dilated end forming the ampulla, to its complementary bony semicircular canal, only much smaller.\nThe saccule is a smaller, rounded sac lying in the antero -\ninferior part of  the vestibule of  the bony labyrinth (Fig. 8.131). The cochlear duct empties into it.\nThe utriculosaccular duct establishes continuity \nbetween all components of  the membranous labyrinth and connects the utricle and saccule. Branching from this small duct is the endolymphatic duct, which enters the ves -\ntibular aqueduct (a channel through the temporal bone) to emerge onto the posterior surface of  the petrous part of  the temporal bone in the posterior cranial fossa.

As it continues anterosuperiorly across the middle ear, it is separated from the tympanic membrane by the handle of  the malleus. It leaves the middle ear through the medial end of  the petrotympanic fissure, enters the infratemporal fossa, descends medial to the spine of  the sphenoid and then to the lateral pterygoid muscle, and joins the lingual nerve.\nPreganglionic parasympathetic fibers carried in the \nchorda tympani synapse with postganglionic parasympa-thetic fibers in the submandibular ganglion, which \u201changs off \u201d the lingual nerve in the floor of  the oral cavity (Fig. 8.150).\nPostganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the sub -\nmandibular ganglion and either:\n\u25a0 reenter the lingual nerve to travel with its terminal \nbranches to reach target tissues, or\n\u25a0 pass directl y from the submandibular ganglion into \nglands (Fig. 8.150).\nThe taste (SA) fibers do not pass through the ganglion \nand are distributed with terminal branches of  the lingual \nnerve.it is in a shallow groove on the medial surface of  the  \nmandible immediately inferior to the last molar tooth.  \nIn this position, it is palpable through the oral mucosa and in danger when one is operating on the molar teeth and gingivae (Fig. 8.149C).\nThe lingual nerve passes into the tongue on the lateral \nsurface of  the hyoglossus muscle where it is attached to  \nthe submandibular ganglion.

In addition to \ninnervating all lower teeth and much of  the associated gingivae, it also supplies the mucosa and skin of  the lower lip and skin of  the chin.

It descends on the lateral surface of  the medial pterygoid muscle, passes between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of  the mandible, and then enters  \nthe mandibular canal through the mandibular foramen. Just before entering the mandibular foramen, it gives origin to the nerve to the mylohyoid (Fig. 8.149C), \nwhich lies in the mylohyoid groove inferior to the foramen and continues anteriorly below the floor of  the oral cavity to innervate the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of  the digastric muscle.\nThe inferior alveolar nerve passes anteriorly within the \nmandibular canal of  the lower jaw . The mandibular canal and its contents are inferior to the roots of  the molar teeth, and the roots can sometimes curve around the canal making extraction of  these teeth difficult.\nThe inferior alveolar nerve supplies branches to the \nthree molar teeth and the second premolar tooth and associated labial gingivae, and then divides into its two terminal branches:\n\u25a0 the incisive nerve, which continues in the mandibular \ncanal to supply the first premolar, incisor, and canine teeth, and related gingivae; and\n\u25a0 the mental nerve, which exits the mandible through \nthe mental foramen and supplies the lower lip and  \nchin (Fig. 8.149A,B). The mental nerve is palpable and \nsometimes visible through the oral mucosa adjacent to the roots of  the premolar teeth.In the clinic\nLingual nerve injury\nA lingual nerve injury proximal to where the chorda \ntympani joins it in the infratemporal fossa will produce loss of general sensation from the anterior two-thirds of \nthe tongue, oral mucosa, gingivae, the lower lip, and the \nchin.\nIf a lingual nerve lesion is distal to the site where it is \njoined by the chorda tympani, secretion from the salivary glands below the oral fissure and taste from the anterior \ntwo-thirds of the tongue will also be lost."

It \nalso contains the pterygopalatine ganglion where pregan-glionic parasympathetic fibers originating in the facial nerve [VII] synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers and these fibers, along with sympathetic fibers origi-nating from the T1 spinal cord level join branches of  the maxillary nerve [V\n2].\nAll the upper teeth receive their innervation and blood \nsupply from the maxillary nerve [V 2] and the terminal part \nof  the maxillary artery , respectively , that pass through the pterygopalatine fossa.Veins that drain regions supplied by arteries branching \nfrom the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa connect with the pterygoid plexus. These tributary veins include those that drain the nasal cavity , roof  and lateral wall of  the oral cavity , all teeth, muscles of  the infratemporal fossa, paranasal sinuses, and nasopharynx. In addition, the inferior ophthalmic vein from the orbit can drain through the inferior orbital fissure into the pterygoid plexus.\nSignificantly , small emissary veins often connect the \npterygoid plexus in the infratemporal fossa to the cavern -\nous sinus in the cranial cavity . These emissary veins, which pass through the foramen ovale, through the cartilage that fills the foramen lacerum, and through a small sphenoidal foramen on the medial side of  the lateral plate of  the ptery -\ngoid process at the base of  the skull, are a route by which infections can spread into the cranial cavity from struc -\ntures, such as the teeth, that are drained by the pterygoid plexus.

Within the tube, four compartments provide longitudinal organization  \n(Fig. 8.160):\n\u25a0 The viscer al compartment is anterior and contains \nparts of  the digestive and respiratory systems, and several endocrine glands.\n\u25a0 The v ertebral compartment is posterior and contains \nthe cervical vertebrae, spinal cord, cervical nerves, and muscles associated with the vertebral column.\n\u25a0 The tw o vascular compartments, one on each side, are \nlateral and contain the major blood vessels and the vagus nerve [X].\nAll these compartments are contained within unique \nlayers of  cervical fascia.\nFor descriptive purposes the neck is divided into anterior \nand posterior triangles (Fig. 8.161):\n\u25a0 The boundaries of  the anterior triangle are the ante-\nrior border of  the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the \ninferior border of  the mandible, and the midline of  the neck.\n\u25a0 The boundaries of  the posterior triangle are the pos -\nterior border of  the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the \nFig. 8.160  C ompartments of the neck. \nAnterior Compartments\nVisceral\nVascular\nVertebral\nPosteriorFascia\nSuperficialPretracheal\nInvestingCaroti d\nsheath\nPrevertebral\nFig. 8.161  Ant erior and posterior triangles of the neck. \nInferior border of mandible\nAnterior\ntriangleSternocleidomastoid muscle\nClavicle Trapezius musclePosterior\ntriangleanterior border of  the trapezius muscle, and the middle one-third of  the clavicle.\nFascia\nThe fascia of  the neck has a number of  unique features.\nThe superficial fascia in the neck contains a thin sheet \nof  muscle (the platysma), which begins in the superficial \nfascia of  the thorax, runs upward to attach to the mandible and blend with the muscles on the face, is innervated by the cervical branch of  the facial nerve [VII], and is only found in this location.\nDeep to the superficial fascia, the deep cervical fascia is \norganized into several distinct layers (Fig. 8.160).

It is \ncontinuous with the trachea below and the pharynx  \nposterosuperiorly (see pp. 1041\u20131058).\nThyroid and parathyroid glands\nThe thyroid and parathyroid glands are endocrine glands \npositioned anteriorly in the neck.\nBoth glands begin as pharyngeal outgrowths that \nmigrate caudally to their final positions as development continues.\nThe thyroid gland is a large, unpaired gland, while the \nparathyroid glands, usually four in number, are small and are on the posterior surface of  the thyroid gland.\nThyroid gland\nThe thyroid gland is anterior in the neck below and lateral to the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 8.178). It consists of  two lateral lobes (which cover the anterolateral surfaces of   \nthe trachea, the cricoid cartilage, and the lower part of  the thyroid cartilage) with an isthmus that connects the \nlateral lobes and crosses the anterior surfaces of  the second and third tracheal cartilages.\nLying deep to the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and omo -\nhyoid muscles, the thyroid gland is in the visceral compart -\nment of  the neck. This compartment also includes the pharynx, trachea, and esophagus and is surrounded by the pretracheal layers of  fascia.\nThe thyroid gland arises as a median outgrowth from \nthe floor of  the pharynx near the base of  the tongue. The foramen cecum of  the tongue indicates the site of  origin and the thyroglossal duct marks the path of  migration of  the thyroid gland to its final adult location. The thyroglos -\nsal duct usually disappears early in development, but remnants may persist as a cyst or as a connection to the foramen cecum (i.e., a fistula).\nThere may also be functional thyroid gland:\n\u25a0 associa ted with the tongue (a lingual thyroid),\n\u25a0 an ywhere along the path of  migration of  the thyroid \ngland, or\n\u25a0 e xtending upward from the gland along the path of  the \nthyroglossal duct (a pyramidal lobe).branches from the cervical nerve C1 join the hypoglossal nerve [XII] soon after it leaves the skull.\nAs the hypoglossal nerve [XII] completes its descent  \nand begins to pass forward across the internal and  \nexternal carotid arteries, some of  the cervical nerve fibers leave it and descend between the internal jugular vein and the internal, and then common, carotid arteries. These nerve fibers are the superior root of  the ansa cervicalis \nand innervate the superior belly of  the omohyoid muscle, and the upper parts of  the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles.\nCompleting the loop is a direct branch from the cervical \nplexus containing nerve fibers from the second and third cervical nerves C2 and C3 (Fig. 8.177). This is the inferior \nroot of  the ansa cervicalis. It descends either medial or lateral to the internal jugular vein before turning medially to join the superior root. At this location, the ansa cervica -\nlis gives off  branches that innervate the inferior belly of  the omohyoid, and the lower parts of  the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles.\nElements of  the gastrointestinal  \nand respiratory systems\nThe esophagus, trachea, pharynx, and larynx lie in the neck and are related to the anterior triangles.\nEsophagus\nThe esophagus is part of  the gastrointestinal system  \nand has only a short course in the lower neck. It begins  \nat vertebral level CVI, where it is continuous with the pharynx above and courses inferiorly to pass through the thoracic inlet.

Assessment of the \nvocal folds is necessary before and after thyroid surgery because the recurrent laryngeal nerves are closely related to ligaments that bind the gland to the larynx and can be easily \ntraumatized during surgical procedures.\nFig. 8.181  Sur gical view of left lobe of enlarged thyroid (goiter) \nretracted to show close association with recurrent laryngeal \nnerve. \nLeft lobe of thyroid gland\nLeft recurrent laryngeal nerve\nIn the clinic\nThyroid gland pathology\nThyroid gland pathology is extremely complex. In essence, \nthyroid gland pathology should be assessed from two points of view. First, the thyroid gland may be diffusely or focally \nenlarged, for which there are numerous causes. Second, the \nthyroid gland may undersecrete or oversecrete the hormone thyroxine.\nOne of the commonest disorders of the thyroid gland is a \nmultinodular goiter, which is a diffuse irregular enlargement \nof the thyroid gland with areas of thyroid hypertrophy and \ncolloid cyst formation. Most patients are euthyroid (i.e., have normal serum thyroxine levels). The typical symptom is a diffuse mass in the neck, which may be managed medically \nor may need surgical excision if the mass is large enough to \naffect the patient\u2019s life or cause respiratory problems.Isolated nodules in the thyroid gland may be a dominant \nnodule in a multinodular gland or possibly an isolated tumor \nof the thyroid gland. Isolated tumors may or may not \nsecrete thyroxine depending on their cellular morphology. Treatment is usually by excision.\nImmunological diseases may affect the thyroid gland and \nmay overstimulate it to produce excessive thyroxine. These \ndiseases may be associated with other extrathyroid \nmanifestations, which include exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema, and nail changes. Other causes of diffuse thyroid stimulation include viral thyroiditis. Some diseases may cause atrophy of the thyroid gland, leading to \nundersecretion of thyroxine ( myxedema)."

This artery branches from the inferior edge of  the subclavian artery and descends.\nIt passes posterior to the clavicle and the large veins in \nthe region and anterior to the pleural cavity . It enters the thoracic cavity posterior to the ribs and anterior to the transversus thoracis muscle and continues to descend giving off  numerous branches.\nCostocervical trunk\nThe final branch of  the subclavian artery in the root of  the neck is the costocervical trunk (Fig. 8.191). It arises in \na slightly different position, depending on the side:\n\u25a0 On the left, it arises from the fir st part of  the subclavian \nartery , just medial to the anterior scalene muscle.\n\u25a0 On the right, it arises from the second par t of  the sub -\nclavian artery .\nOn both sides, the costocervical trunk ascends and \npasses posteriorly over the dome of  the pleural cavity and \ncontinues in a posterior direction behind the anterior scalene muscle. Eventually it divides into two branches\u2014the deep cervical and the supreme intercostal arteries:\n\u25a0 The deep cervical artery ascends in the back of  the \nneck and anastomoses with the descending branch of  the occipital artery .It continues laterally over rib I, and becomes the axillary artery as it crosses the lateral border of  rib I.\nBoth subclavian arteries are divided into three parts by \nthe anterior scalene muscle (Fig. 8.191):\n\u25a0 The first part extends from the origin of  the artery to the \nanterior scalene muscle.\n\u25a0 The second par t is the part of  the artery posterior to the \nanterior scalene muscle.\n\u25a0 The third par t is the part lateral to the anterior scalene \nmuscle before the artery reaches the lateral border  \nof  rib I.\nAll branches from the right and left subclavian arteries \narise from the first part of  the artery , except in the case  \nof  one branch (the costocervical trunk) on the right side \n(Fig. 8.191). The branches include the vertebral artery , the thyrocervical trunk, the internal thoracic artery , and the costocervical trunk.\nVertebral artery\nThe vertebral artery is the first branch of  the subclavian \nartery as it enters the root of  the neck (Fig. 8.191). A large branch, arising from the first part of  the subclavian artery medial to the anterior scalene muscle, it ascends and enters the foramen in the transverse process of  vertebra CVI. Continuing to pass superiorly , the vertebral artery passes through the foramina of  vertebrae CV to CI. At the superior border of  vertebra CI, the artery turns medially and crosses the posterior arch of  vertebra CI. From here it passes through the foramen magnum to enter the posterior cranial fossa.\nThyrocervical trunk\nThe second branch of  the subclavian artery is the thyro-\ncervical trunk (Fig. 8.191). It arises from the first part of  the subclavian artery medial to the anterior scalene muscle, and divides into three branches\u2014the inferior thyroid, the transverse cervical, and the suprascapular  \narteries.\nInferior thyroid artery.  The inferior thyroid artery (Fig. \n8.191) is the superior continuation of  the thyrocervical trunk. It ascends, anterior to the anterior scalene muscle, and eventually turns medially , crossing posterior to the carotid sheath and its contents and anterior to the vertebral artery . Reaching the posterior surface of  the thyroid gland it supplies the thyroid gland.\nWhen the inferior thyroid artery turns medially , it gives \noff  an important branch (the ascending cervical artery ), \nwhich continues to ascend on the anterior surface of  the prevertebral muscles, supplying these muscles and sending branches to the spinal cord."

It begins on the lower aspect of  the stylohyoid ligament, which con -\nnects the tip of  the styloid process of  the temporal bone to the lesser horn of  the hyoid bone. The line continues  \nonto the lesser horn and then turns and runs posteriorly along the entire upper surface of  the greater horn of  the hyoid where it terminates.\nThird part\nThe most inferior and third part of  the line of  attachment of  the lateral pharyngeal wall begins superiorly on the superior tubercle of  the thyroid cartilage, and descends along the oblique line to the inferior tubercle.\nFrom the inferior tubercle, the line of  attachment con-\ntinues over the cricothyroid muscle along a tendinous thickening of  fascia to the cricoid cartilage where it terminates.\nPharyngeal wall\nThe pharyngeal wall is formed by skeletal muscles and by fascia. Gaps between the muscles are reinforced by the fascia and provide routes for structures to pass through  \nthe wall.\nMuscles\nThe muscles of  the pharynx are organized into two groups based on the orientation of  muscle fibers.\nThe constrictor muscles have fibers oriented in a circular \ndirection relative to the pharyngeal wall, whereas the longitudinal muscles have fibers oriented vertically .\nConstrictor muscles\nThe three constrictor muscles on each side are major con -\ntributors to the structure of  the pharyngeal wall (Fig. 8.202  \nand Table 8.17) and their names indicate their position\u2014\nsuperior, middle, and inferior constrictor muscles. Posteriorly , the muscles from each side are joined together by the pharyngeal raphe. Anteriorly , these muscles attach to bones, cartilages, and ligaments related to the lateral margins of  the nasal and oral cavities and the larynx.\nThe constrictor muscles overlap each other in a fashion \nresembling the walls of  three flower pots stacked one on the other. The inferior constrictors overlap the lower margins of  the middle constrictors and, in the same way , the middle constrictors overlap the superior constrictors.passes onto the petrous part of  the temporal bone where it is just medial to the roughening for the attachment of  one of  the muscles (levator veli palatini) of  the soft palate. From here, the line swings medially onto the occipital bone and joins the line from the other side at a prominent elevation of  bone in the midline (the pharyngeal tubercle).\nAnterior vertical line of attachment for  \nthe lateral pharyngeal walls\nThe vertical line of  attachment for the lateral pharyngeal walls to structures related to the nasal and oral cavities and larynx is discontinuous and in three parts (Fig. 8.201).\nFirst part\nOn each side, the anterior line of  attachment of  the lateral pharyngeal wall begins superiorly on the posterior edge of  the medial pterygoid plate of  the sphenoid bone just inferior to where the pharyngotympanic tube lies against this plate. It continues inferiorly along the edge of  the medial plate of  the pterygoid process and onto the pterygoid hamulus. From this point, the line descends along the pterygoman -\ndibular raphe to the mandible where this part of  the line terminates.\nThe pterygomandibular raphe is a linear cord-like \nconnective tissue ligament that spans the distance between the tip of  the pterygoid hamulus and a triangular roughen -\ning immediately posterior to the third molar on the \nFig. 8.201  A ttachments of the lateral pharyngeal wall. \nMedial plate\nof pterygoid  process Pharyngotympanic tube\nPharyngeal tubercle\nStyloid\nprocessPterygoid hamulus\nPharyngea l\nrapheRetro-\npharyngealspace\nEsophagusCricothyroid muscle\nCricoid cartilageOblique lineStylohyoid ligamentPterygomandibularraphe\nCVI"

It is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX].\nSalpingopharyngeus\nThe salpingopharyngeus (Fig. 8.203B) is a small muscle originating from the inferior aspect of  the pharyngotym -\npanic tube, descending on, and blending into, the deep \nsurface of  the pharyngeal wall. It is innervated by the \nvagus nerve [X].\nPalatopharyngeus\nThe palatopharyngeus (Fig. 8.203B), in addition to being a muscle of  the pharynx, is also a muscle of  the soft palate (see pp. 1098\u20131099). It is attached to the upper surface of  the palatine aponeurosis, and passes posteriorly and inferi-orly to blend with the deep surface of  the pharyngeal wall.\nThe palatopharyngeus forms an important fold in the \noverlying mucosa (the palatopharyngeal arch). This arch is visible through the oral cavity and is a landmark for finding the palatine tonsil, which is immediately anterior to it on the oropharyngeal wall.\nIn addition to elevating the pharynx, the palatopharyn -\ngeus participates in closing the oropharyngeal isthmus by depressing the palate and moving the palatopharyngeal fold toward the midline.\nThe palatopharyngeus is innervated by the vagus nerve \n[X].\nFascia\nThe pharyngeal fascia is separated into two layers, which sandwich the pharyngeal muscles between them:\n\u25a0 A thin la yer ( buccopharyngeal fascia) coats the \noutside of  the muscular part of  the wall and is a  \ncomponent of  the pretracheal layer of  cervical fascia (see p. 991).\n\u25a0 A m uch thicker layer ( pharyngobasilar fascia) lines \nthe inner surface.\nThe fascia reinforces the pharyngeal wall where muscle \nis deficient. This is particularly evident above the level of  \nthe superior constrictor where the pharyngeal wall is formed almost entirely of  fascia (Fig. 8.203). This part of  the wall is reinforced externally by muscles of  the soft palate (tensor and levator veli palatini)."

This triangular-shaped gap ( oropharyngeal \ntriangle) not only enables the stylopharyngeus to slip into \nthe pharyngeal wall, but also allows muscles, nerves, and vessels to pass between regions lateral to the pharyngeal wall and the oral cavity , particularly to the tongue.\nThe gap between the middle and inferior constrictor \nmuscles allows the internal laryngeal vessels and nerve access to the aperture in the thyrohyoid membrane to enter the larynx.\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerves and accompanying \ninferior laryngeal vessels enter the larynx posterior to the inferior horn of  the thyroid cartilage deep to the inferior margin of  the inferior constrictor muscle.\nNasopharynx\nThe nasopharynx is behind the posterior apertures (choanae) of  the nasal cavities and above the level of  the soft palate (Fig. 8.205). Its ceiling is formed by the sloping base of  the skull and consists of  the posterior part of  the body of  the sphenoid bone and the basal part of  the occipi-tal bone. The ceiling and lateral walls of  the nasopharynx form a domed vault at the top of  the pharyngeal cavity that is always open.\nThe cavity of  the nasopharynx is continuous below \nwith the cavity of  the oropharynx at the pharyngeal isthmus. The position of  the pharyngeal isthmus is marked on the pharyngeal wall by a mucosal fold caused by the underlying palatopharyngeal sphincter, which is part of  the superior constrictor muscle.\nElevation of  the soft palate and constriction of  the pala -\ntopharyngeal sphincter closes the pharyngeal isthmus during swallowing and separates the nasopharynx from the oropharynx.\nThere is a large collection of  lymphoid tissue (the pha-\nryngeal tonsil) in the mucosa covering the roof  of  the nasopharynx. Enlargement of  this tonsil, known then as adenoids, can occlude the nasopharynx so that breathing is only possible through the oral cavity (Fig. 8.205A).\nThe most prominent features on each lateral wall of  the \nnasopharynx are:\n\u25a0 the phar yngeal opening of  the pharyngotympanic tube, \nand\n\u25a0 m ucosal elevations and folds covering the end of  the \npharyngotympanic tube and the adjacent muscles.\nThe opening of  the pharyngotympanic tube is posterior \nto and slightly above the level of  the hard palate, and lateral \nto the top of  the soft palate (Fig. 8.205A).\nBecause the pharyngotympanic tube projects into the \nnasopharynx from a posterolateral direction, its posterior Gaps in the pharyngeal wall and structures \npassing through them\nGaps between muscles of  the pharyngeal wall provide \nimportant routes for muscles and neurovascular tissues (Fig. 8.204).\nAbove the margin of  the superior constrictor, the pha -\nryngeal wall is deficient in muscle and completed by pha-ryngeal fascia.\nThe tensor and levator veli palatini muscles of  the soft \npalate initially descend from the base of  the skull and are lateral to the pharyngeal fascia. In this position, they reinforce the pharyngeal wall:\n\u25a0 The lev ator veli palatini passes through the pharyngeal \nfascia inferior to the pharyngotympanic tube and  \nenters the soft palate.\n\u25a0 The tendon of  the tensor veli palatini turns medially \naround the pterygoid hamulus and passes through the origin of  the buccinator muscle to enter the soft palate.\nOne of  the largest and most important apertures in the \npharyngeal wall is between the superior and middle con -\nstrictor muscles of  the pharynx and the posterior border of  \nthe mylohyoid muscle, which forms the floor of  the mouth \nFig. 8.204  Gaps between muscles in the phar yngeal wall. \nPharyngeal fascia\nStylopharyngeusSuperior constrictor\nMiddle constrictorInferior constrictorOropharyngeal\ntriangle:structures (muscles,nerves, vessels)passing into and outof the oral cavity\nInternal laryngeal\nnerve and vessels\nEsophagusRecurrent laryngealnerve and vessels TracheaMylohyoidBuccinator"

A person cannot breathe and swallow at the same time because the airway is closed at two sites, the pharyngeal isthmus and the larynx.\nLaryngopharynx\nThe laryngopharynx extends from the superior margin of  the epiglottis to the top of  the esophagus at the level of  vertebra CVI (Fig. 8.205).\nThe laryngeal inlet opens into the anterior wall of  the \nlaryngopharynx.

The palatoglossal folds (arches), one on each side, that cover the palatoglossal muscles, mark the boundary between the oral cavity and the oropharynx.

This action causes the vocal folds to vibrate against each other and produce sounds, which can then be modified by the upper parts of  the airway and oral cavity . Tension in the vocal folds can be adjusted by the vocalis and cricothyroid muscles.\nEffort closure\nEffort closure of  the larynx (Fig. 8.225D) occurs when air is retained in the thoracic cavity to stabilize the trunk, for example during heavy lifting, or as part of  the mechanism for increasing intra-abdominal pressure. During effort closure, the rima glottidis is completely closed, as is the rima vestibuli and lower parts of  the vestibule. The result is to completely and forcefully shut the airway .\nSwallowing\nDuring swallowing, the rima glottidis, rima vestibuli, and vestibule are closed and the laryngeal inlet is narrowed. In addition, the larynx moves up and forward. This action causes the epiglottis to swing downward toward the ary -\ntenoid cartilages and to effectively narrow or close the laryngeal inlet (Fig. 8.225E). The up and forward move -\nment of  the larynx also opens the esophagus, which is attached to the posterior aspect of  the lamina of  the cricoid cartilage. All these actions together prevent solids  \nand liquids from entry into the airway and facilitate  \ntheir movement through the piriform fossae into the esophagus.In the clinic\nTracheostomy\nA tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which a hole is \nmade in the trachea and a tube is inserted to enable ventilation.\nA tracheostomy is typically performed when there is \nobstruction to the larynx as a result of inhalation of a foreign body, severe edema secondary to anaphylactic reaction, or severe head and neck trauma.\nThe typical situation in which a tracheostomy is \nperformed is in the calm atmosphere of an operating theater. A small transverse incision is placed in the lower third of the neck anteriorly. The strap muscles are deviated laterally and the trachea can be easily visualized. \nOccasionally it is necessary to divide the isthmus of the \nthyroid gland. An incision is made in the second and third tracheal rings and a small tracheostomy tube inserted.\nAfter the tracheostomy has been in situ for the required \nlength of time, it is simply removed. The hole through which \nit was inserted almost inevitably closes without any \nintervention.\nPatients with long-term tracheostomies are unable to \nvocalize because no air is passing through the vocal cords.\nIn the clinic\nLaryngoscopy\nLaryngoscopy is a medical procedure that is used to inspect the larynx. The functions of laryngoscopy include the evaluation of patients with difficulty swallowing, assessment \nof the vocal cords, and assessment of the larynx for tumors, \nmasses, and weak voice.\nThe larynx is typically visualized using two methods. \nIndirect laryngoscopy involves passage of a small rod-mounted mirror (not dissimilar to a dental mirror) into \nthe oropharynx permitting indirect visualization of the \nlarynx. Direct laryngoscopy can be performed using a device with a curved metal tip that holds the tongue and epiglottis forward, allowing direct inspection of the larynx. This \nprocedure can be performed only in the unconscious patient \nor in a patient in whom the gag reflex is not intact. Other methods of inspection include the passage of fiberoptic endoscopes through either the oral cavity or nasal cavity.In the clinic\nCricothyrotomy\nIn emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated and a small tube inserted \nthrough the incision to establish an airway. Except for \nsmall vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and the skin."

They synapse mainly in the superior \ncervical sympathetic ganglion, and postganglionic fibers reach the nasal cavities along blood vessels, or by  \njoining branches of  the maxillary nerve [V\n2] in the ptery -\ngopalatine fossa.\nBlood supply to the nasal cavities is by:\n\u25a0 ter minal branches of  the maxillary and facial arteries, \nwhich originate from the external carotid artery , and\n\u25a0 ethmoidal branches of  the ophthalmic artery , which \noriginates from the internal carotid artery .\nSkeletal framework\nBones that contribute to the skeletal framework of  the nasal cavities include:\n\u25a0 the unpaired ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, and v omer \nbones, and\n\u25a0 the paired nasal, maxillar y , palatine, and lacrimal bones \nand inferior conchae.\nOf  all the bones associated with the nasal cavities, the \nethmoid is a key element.\nEthmoid bone\nThe single ethmoid bone is one of  the most complex bones \nin the skull. It contributes to the roof, lateral wall, and medial wall of  both nasal cavities, and contains the eth -\nmoidal cells (ethmoidal sinuses).\nThe ethmoid bone is cuboidal in overall shape (Fig. \n8.233A) and is composed of  two rectangular box- shaped ethmoidal labyrinths, one on each side, united superiorly across the midline by a perforated sheet of   \nbone (the cribriform plate). A second sheet of  bone (the \nperpendicular plate) descends vertically in the median sagittal plane from the cribriform plate to form part of  the nasal septum.\nEach ethmoidal labyrinth is composed of  two delicate \nsheets of  bone, which sandwich between them the eth-moidal cells.\n\u25a0 The la teral sheet of  bone (the orbital plate) is flat and \nforms part of  the medial wall of  the orbit.\n\u25a0 The medial sheet of  bone forms the upper part of  the \nlateral wall of  the nasal cavity and is characterized by two processes and a swelling (Fig. 8.233B)\u2014the two processes are curved shelves of  bone (the superior and middle conchae), which project across the nasal cavity and curve downward ending in free medial margins, while inferior to the origin of  the middle concha, the middle ethmoidal cells form a prominent bulge (the ethmoidal bulla), on the medial wall of  the labyrinth.\nExtending anterosuperiorly from just under the bulla is \na groove (the ethmoidal infundibulum), which contin -\nues upward, and narrows to form a channel that penetrates \nthe ethmoidal labyrinth and opens into the frontal sinus. This channel is for the frontonasal duct, which drains the frontal sinus.\nThe superior surface of  the ethmoidal labyrinth articu -\nlates with the frontal bone, which usually completes  \nthe roof  of  the ethmoidal cells, while the anterior surface articulates with the frontal process of  the maxilla and with the lacrimal bone. The inferior surface articulates with the upper medial margin of  the maxilla.\nA delicate irregularly shaped projection (the uncinate \nprocess) on the anterior aspect of  the inferior surface of  the ethmoidal labyrinth extends posteroinferiorly across a large defect (maxillary hiatus) in the medial wall of  the maxilla to articulate with the inferior concha.\nThe cribriform plate is at the apex of  the nasal cavities \nand fills the ethmoidal notch in the frontal bone  \n(Fig. 8.233) and separates the nasal cavities below from  \nthe cranial cavity above. Small perforations in the bone allow the fibers of  the olfactory nerve [I] to pass between the two regions.\nA large triangular process (the crista galli) at the \nmidline on the superior surface of  the cribriform plate anchors a fold (falx cerebri) of  dura mater in the  \ncranial cavity .\nThe perpendicular plate of  the ethmoid bone is quad -\nrangular in shape, descends in the midline from the cribri -\nform plate, and forms the upper part of  the median nasal septum (Fig. 8.233).

In addition, small foramina between the cribriform plate and surrounding bone allow the anterior ethmoidal nerve, a branch of  the ophthalmic nerve [V\n1], \nand accompanying vessels to pass from the orbit into the cranial cavity and then down into the nasal cavity .\nIn addition, there is a connection in some individuals \nbetween nasal veins and the superior sagittal sinus of   \nthe cranial cavity through a prominent foramen (the foramen cecum) in the midline between the crista galli and frontal bone.\nSphenopalatine foramen\nOne of  the most important routes by which nerves and vessels enter and leave the nasal cavity is the sphenopala -\ntine foramen in the posterolateral wall of  the superior nasal meatus.

Major structures passing through the foramen are:\n\u25a0 the sphenopala tine branch of  the maxillary artery ,\n\u25a0 the nasopala tine branch of  the maxillary nerve  \n[V 2], and\n\u25a0 superior nasal br anches of  the maxillary nerve [V 2].\nIncisive canal\nAnother route by which structures enter and leave the nasal cavities is through the incisive canal  in the floor of  \neach nasal cavity . This canal is immediately lateral to the nasal septum and just posterosuperior to the root of  the central incisor in the maxilla. The two incisive canals, one on each side, both open into the single unpaired incisive fossa in the roof  of  the oral cavity and transmit:\n\u25a0 the nasopala tine nerve from the nasal cavity into the \noral cavity , and\n\u25a0 the ter minal end of  the greater palatine artery from the \noral cavity into the nasal cavity .\nSmall foramina in the lateral wall\nOther routes by which vessels and nerves get into and out of  the nasal cavity include the nares and small foramina in the lateral wall:\n\u25a0 Inter nal nasal branches of  the infra-orbital nerve of  the \nmaxillary nerve [V 2] and alar branches of  the nasal \nartery from the facial artery loop around the margin of  the naris to gain entry to the lateral wall of  the nasal cavity from the face.\n\u25a0 Inf erior nasal branches from the greater palatine branch \nof  the maxillary nerve [V 2] enter the lateral wall of  the \nnasal cavity from the palatine canal by passing through small foramina on the lateral wall.\nVessels\nThe nasal cavities have a rich vascular supply for altering the humidity and temperature of  respired air.

It gives rise to branches that supply the medial (septal) and lateral wall of  the nasal cavity and then continues forward on the deep surface of  the nasal bone, and terminates by passing between the nasal bone and lateral nasal cartilage to emerge on the external nose as the external nasal branch to supply skin and adjacent tissues.\nVessels that supply the nasal cavities form extensive \nanastomoses with each other. This is particularly evident in the anterior region of  the medial wall where there are anastomoses between branches of  the greater palatine, sphenopalatine, superior labial, and anterior ethmoidal arteries, and where the vessels are relatively close to the surface (Fig. 8.243B). This area is the major site of  nose -\nbleeds, or epistaxis.\nVeins\nVeins draining the nasal cavities generally follow the arter -\nies (Fig. 8.244):Fig. 8.244  V enous drainage of the nasal cavities. \nNasal vein in foramen cecum\nDrainage to cavernous\nsinus in cranial cavity\nDrainage to pterygoid plexus\nin infratem poral fossaDrainage to facial vein\n\u25a0 V eins that pass with branches that ultimately originate \nfrom the maxillary artery drain into the pterygoid \nplexus of  veins in the infratemporal fossa.\n\u25a0 V eins from anterior regions of  the nasal cavities join the \nfacial vein.\nIn some individuals, an additional nasal vein passes \nsuperiorly through a midline aperture (the foramen \ncecum), in the frontal bone anterior to the crista galli,  \nand joins with the anterior end of  the superior sagittal sinus. Because this nasal vein connects an intracranial venous sinus with extracranial veins, it is classified as an emissary vein. Emissary veins in general are routes by which infections can track from peripheral regions into the cranial cavity .\nVeins that accompany the anterior and posterior  \nethmoidal arteries are tributaries of  the superior ophthal-mic vein, which is one of  the largest emissary veins and drains into the cavernous sinus on either side of  the hypophyseal fossa."

Together, the two palatine processes form the anterior two-thirds of  the hard palate.\nIn the midline on the inferior surface of  the hard palate \nand at the anterior end of  the intermaxillary suture is a single small fossa (incisive fossa) just behind the incisor teeth. Two incisive canals, one on each side, extend pos -\nterosuperiorly from the roof  of  this fossa to open onto the floor of  the nasal cavity . The canals and fossae allow passage of  the greater palatine vessels and the nasopalatine nerves.\nPalatine bones\nThe parts of  each L-shaped palatine bone that contribute \nto the roof  of  the oral cavity are the horizontal plate and the pyramidal process (Fig. 8.248A).\nThe horizontal plate projects medially from the inferior \naspect of  the palatine bone and is joined by sutures to its partner in the midline and, on the same side, with the pala -\ntine process of  the maxilla anteriorly .\nA single posterior nasal spine is formed at the midline \nwhere the two horizontal plates join and projects backward from the margin of  the hard palate.

The tensor veli palatini muscle is attached, in part, to the membranous lamina.\nMandible\nThe mandible is the bone of  the lower jaw (Fig. 8.249).

The site of  fusion is particularly visible on the external surface of  the bone as a small vertical ridge in the midline.\nThe upper surface of  the body of  the mandible bears the \nalveolar arch (Fig. 8.249B), which anchors the lower teeth, and on its external surface on each side is a small mental foramen (Fig. 8.249B).\nPosterior to the mandibular symphysis on the internal \nsurface of  the mandible are two pairs of  small spines, one pair immediately above the other pair. These are the supe-\nrior and inferior mental spines (superior and inferior \ngenial spines) (Fig. 8.249A,C), and are attachment sites for a pair of  muscles that pass into the tongue and a pair of  muscles that connect the mandible to the hyoid bone.\nExtending from the midline and originating inferior to \nthe mental spines is a raised line or ridge (the mylohyoid line) (Fig. 8.249C), which runs posteriorly and superiorly along the internal surface of  each side of  the body of  the mandible to end just below the level of  the last molar tooth.\nAbove the anterior one-third of  the mylohyoid line is a \nshallow depression (the sublingual fossa) (Fig. 8.249C), and below the posterior two-thirds of  the mylohyoid  \nline is another depression (the submandibular fossa ) \n(Fig. 8.249C).The pterygoid processes descend, one on each side, from \nthe lateral aspect of  the body of  the sphenoid bone. Each process has a medial and a lateral plate. These two verti-cally oriented plates project from the posterior aspect of  the process. The V-shaped gap that occurs inferiorly between \nthe two plates is filled by the pyramidal process of  the pala -\ntine bone.\nProjecting posterolaterally from the inferior margin of  \nthe medial plate of  the pterygoid process is an elongate hook-shaped structure (the pterygoid hamulus).

It can be as long as  \n1 inch (2.5  cm) and points to ward the lesser horn of   \nthe hyoid bone to which it is attached by the stylohyoid ligament (Fig. 8.248B). The root of  the styloid process is immediately anterior to the stylomastoid foramen and lateral to the jugular foramen.

Near the posterior border of  the hyoglossus muscle, the remaining fibers leave the hypoglossal nerve [XII] and form two nerves:\n\u25a0 the thyrohyoid branch, which remains in the neck to \ninnervate the thyrohyoid muscle, and\n\u25a0 the br anch to the geniohyoid, which passes into the floor \nof  the oral cavity to innervate the geniohyoid.\nLymphatics\nAll lymphatic vessels from the tongue ultimately drain  \ninto the deep cervical chain of  nodes along the internal jugular vein:\n\u25a0 The phar yngeal part of  the tongue drains through the \npharyngeal wall directly into mainly the jugulodigastric node of  the deep cervical chain.\n\u25a0 The or al part of  the tongue drains both directly into the \ndeep cervical nodes, and indirectly into these nodes by passing first through the mylohyoid muscle and into submental and submandibular nodes.\nThe submental nodes are inferior to the mylohyoid \nmuscles and between the digastric muscles, while the \nsubmandibular nodes are below the floor of  the oral cavity along the inner aspect of  the inferior margins of  the mandible.\nThe tip of  the tongue drains through the mylohyoid \nmuscle into the submental nodes and then into mainly the jugulo-omohyoid node of  the deep cervical chain.\nSalivary glands\nSalivary glands are glands that open or secrete into the oral cavity . Most are small glands in the submucosa or mucosa of  the oral epithelium lining the tongue, palate, cheeks, and lips, and open into the oral cavity directly or via small ducts. In addition to these small glands are much larger glands, which include the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands.\nFig. 8.264  P arotid gland. \nMasseter Buccinator\nParotid duct\n(penetrates buccinator oppositecrown of 2nd upper molar tooth)SternocleidomastoidParotid gland\nExternal acoustic meatus"

The base is attached along an oblique line that begins medially at the scaphoid fossa near the root of  the pterygoid process of  the sphenoid bone and continues laterally along the membranous  \npart of  the pharyngotympanic tube to the spine of  the sphenoid bone.\nThe tensor veli palatini descends vertically along the \nlateral surface of  the medial plate of  the pterygoid process and pharyngeal wall to the pterygoid hamulus where the fibers converge to form a small tendon (Fig. 8.270A).\nThe tendon loops 90\u00b0 medially around the pterygoid \nhamulus, penetrating the origin of  the buccinator muscle as it does, and expands like a fan to form the fibrous hori -\nzontal part of  the muscle.

The greater palatine artery passes forward on the hard palate and then leaves the palate superiorly through the incisive canal to enter the medial wall of  the nasal cavity where it terminates. The greater palatine artery is the major artery of  the hard palate. It also supplies palatal gingiva. The lesser palatine branch passes through the lesser palatine foramen just posterior to the greater palatine foramen, and contributes to the vas -\ncular supply of  the soft palate."

By closing the oropharyngeal isthmus, food or liquid can be held in the oral cavity while breathing.\nTeeth and gingivae\nThe teeth are attached to sockets (alveoli) in two elevated \narches of  bone on the mandible below and the maxillae above (alveolar arches). If  the teeth are removed, the alveo -\nlar bone is resorbed and the arches disappear.\nThe gingivae (gums) are specialized regions of  the oral \nmucosa that surround the teeth and cover adjacent regions of  the alveolar bone.\nThe different types of  teeth are distinguished on  \nthe basis of  morphology , position, and function (Fig. 8.278A).\nIn adults, there are 32 teeth, 16 in the upper jaw and \n16 in the lower jaw . On each side in both maxillary and mandibular arches are two incisor, one canine, two premo -\nlar, and three molar teeth.\n\u25a0 The incisor teeth are the \u201cfront teeth\u201d and have one \nroot and a chisel-shaped crown, which \u201ccuts.\u201d\n\u25a0 The canine teeth are posterior to the incisors, are the \nlongest teeth, have a crown with a single pointed cusp, and \u201cgrasp.\u201d\n\u25a0 The premolar teeth (bicuspids) have a crown with  \ntwo pointed cusps, one on the buccal (cheek) side of   \nthe tooth and the other on the lingual (tongue) or palatal (palate) side, generally have one root (but the upper first premolar next to the canine may have two), and \u201cgrind.\u201d\n\u25a0 The molar teeth are behind the premolar teeth, have \nthree roots and crowns with three to five cusps, and \u201cgrind.\u201d\nTwo successive sets of  teeth develop in humans, decidu-\nous teeth (\u201cbaby\u201d teeth) (Fig. 8.278B) and permanent \nteeth (\u201cadult\u201d teeth). The deciduous teeth emerge from the gingivae at between six months and two years of  age. Permanent teeth begin to emerge and replace the decidu -\nous teeth at around age six years, and can continue to emerge into adulthood.\nThe 20 deciduous teeth consist of  two incisor, one \ncanine, and two molar teeth on each side of  the upper and lower jaws. These teeth are replaced by the incisor, canine, and premolar teeth of  the permanent teeth. The permanent molar teeth erupt posterior to the deciduous  \nmolars and require the jaws to elongate forward to accom -\nmodate them.can be opened and closed, and altered in shape by the movements of  the muscles of  facial expression associated with the lips and surrounding regions, and by movements of  the lower jaw (mandible).\nThe lips are entirely composed of  soft tissues (Fig. \n8.277B). They are lined internally by oral mucosa and covered externally by skin. Externally , there is an area of  transition from the thicker skin that covers the face to the thinner skin that overlies the margins of  the lips and con -\ntinues as oral mucosa onto the deep surfaces of  the lips.\nBlood vessels are closer to the surface in areas where the \nskin is thin and as a consequence there is a vermilion border that covers the margins of  the lips.\nThe upper lip has a shallow vertical groove on its exter -\nnal surface (the philtrum) sandwiched between two ele -\nvated ridges of  skin (Fig. 8.277A). The philtrum and ridges are formed embryologically by fusion of  the medial nasal processes.\nOn the inner surface of  both lips, a fold of  mucosa  \n(the median labial frenulum ) connects the lip to the \nadjacent gum.\nThe lips enclose the orbicularis oris muscle, neurovas -\ncular tissues, and labial glands (Fig. 8.277B). The small pea-shaped labial glands are between the muscle tissue and the oral mucosa and open into the oral vestibule.\nA number of  muscles of  facial expression control the \nshape and size of  the oral fissure. The most important of  these is the orbicularis oris muscle, which encircles the orifice and acts as a sphincter. A number of  other muscles of  facial expression blend into the orbicularis oris or other tissues of  the lips and open or adjust the contours of  the oral fissure. These include the buccinator, levator labii superioris, zygomaticus major and minor, levator anguli oris, depressor labii inferioris, depressor anguli oris, and platysma (see pp. 897\u2013899).\nOropharyngeal isthmus\nThe oropharyngeal isthmus is the opening between the oral cavity and the oropharynx (see Fig. 8.271). It is formed:\n\u25a0 la terally by the palatoglossal arches;\n\u25a0 superiorl y by the soft palate; and\n\u25a0 inf eriorly by the sulcus terminalis of  the tongue that \ndivides the oral surface of  the tongue (anterior  \ntwo-thirds) from the pharyngeal surface (posterior one-third).\nThe oropharyngeal isthmus can be closed by elevation \nof  the posterior aspect of  the tongue, depression of  the \npalate, and medial movement of  the palatoglossal arches toward the midline."

She also had an irregular knobby mass in the \nanterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the \ntrachea to the right.\nA clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and \nhypothyroidism was made.\nEnlargement of the thyroid gland is due to increased \nsecretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which is usually \nsecondary to diminished output of thyroid hormones. The \nthyroid undergoes periods of activity and regression, which \ncan lead to the formation of nodules, some of which are \nsolid and some of which are partially cystic (colloid cysts). \nThis nodule formation is compounded by areas of fibrosis \nwithin the gland. Other causes of multinodular goiter include \niodine deficiency and in certain circumstances, drugs that \ninterfere with the metabolism and production of thyroxine. \nThe typical symptom of a goiter is a painless swelling of the \nthyroid gland. It may be smooth or nodular, and occasionally \nit may extend into the superior mediastinum as a \nretrosternal goiter.\nThe trachea was deviated.\nThe enlargement of the thyroid gland due to a multinodular \ngoiter may not be symmetrical. In this case there was \nsignificant asymmetrical enlargement of the left lobe of the \nthyroid deviating the trachea to the right.\nThe patient had a hoarse voice and noisy breathing.\nIf the thyroid gland enlargement is significant it can \ncompress the trachea, narrowing it to such an extent  \nthat a \u201ccrowing sound\u201d is heard during inspiration  \n(stridor).\nOther possible causes for hoarseness include paralysis of the \nvocal cord due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal \nnerve from the goiter. Of concern is the possibility of \nmalignant change within the goiter directly invading the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Fortunately, malignant change is \nrare within the thyroid gland.\nWhen patients have a relatively low production of thyroxine \nsuch that the basal metabolic rate is reduced they become \nmore susceptible to infection, including throat and upper \nrespiratory tract infections.\nOn examination the thyroid gland moved during swallowing.\nCharacteristically, an enlarged thyroid gland is evident as a \nneck mass arising on one or both sides of the trachea. The \nenlarged thyroid gland moves on swallowing because it is \nattached to the larynx by the pretracheal fascia.\nThe patient was hypothyroid.\nHypothyroidism refers to the clinical and biochemical state in \nwhich the thyroid gland is underactive (hyperthyroidism \nrefers to an overactive thyroid gland). Some patients have \nthyroid masses and no clinical or biochemical \nabnormalities\u2014these patients are euthyroid.\nThe hormone thyroxine controls the basal metabolic rate; \ntherefore, low levels of thyroxine affect the resting pulse rate \nand may produce other changes, including weight gain, and \nin some cases depression.\nThe patient was insistent upon surgery.\nAfter discussion about the risks and complications, a subtotal \nthyroidectomy was performed. After the procedure the \npatient complained of tingling in her hands and feet and \naround her mouth, and carpopedal spasm. These symptoms \nare typical of tetany and are caused by low serum calcium \nlevels.\nThe etiology of the low serum calcium level was trauma and \nbruising of the four parathyroid glands left in situ after the \noperation. Undoubtedly the trauma of removal of such a \nlarge thyroid gland produced a change within the \nparathyroid gland, which failed to function appropriately. The \nsecretion of parathyroid hormone rapidly decreased over the \nnext 24 hours, resulting in increased excitability of peripheral \nnerves, manifest by carpopedal spasm and orofacial tingling. \nMuscle spasms can also be elicited by tapping the facial \n(continues)"

He decided not to continue playing and went to \nwatch the match from the side. Over the next hour he \nbecame extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. \nHe was rushed to hospital.\nWhen he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing \nwas shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate \nhim. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the \nregion of the pterion. No other abnormality was \ndemonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the \nleft temporal fossa.\nA CT scan was performed.\nThe CT scan demonstrated a lentiform area of high density \nwithin the left cranial fossa.\nA diagnosis of extradural hemorrhage was made.\nFractures in the region of the pterion are extremely \ndangerous. A division of the middle meningeal artery passes deep to this structure and is subject to laceration and \ndisruption, especially in conjunction with a skull injury in this \nregion. In this case the middle meningeal artery was torn \nand started to bleed, producing a large extradural clot.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure began to increase.\nWithin the skull there is a fixed volume and clearly what \ngoes in must come out (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid). If \nthere is a space-occupying lesion, such as an extradural \nhematoma, there is no space into which it can decompress. \nAs the lesion expands, the brain becomes compressed and \nthe intracranial pressure increases. This pressure compresses \nvessels, so lowering the cerebral perfusion pressure. T o \ncombat this the homeostatic mechanisms of the body \nincrease the blood pressure to overcome the increase in \nintracerebral pressure. Unfortunately, the increase in \nintracranial pressure is compounded by the cerebral edema \nthat occurs at and after the initial insult.\nAn urgent surgical procedure was performed.\nBurr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma \nand it was evacuated.

This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was \nprovoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On \nexamination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.\nA diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.\nThe formation of stones in the salivary glands is not \nuncommon, but it is more likely in the submandibular gland than in the parotid gland because the saliva is more \nmucinous and the duct has a long upward course from the \nfloor of the mouth. Nevertheless, stones do form in the \nparotid gland and the parotid ducts. Notably, most parotid \nduct calculi and submandibular duct calculi occur in mouths with excellent dental hygiene and mucosa.\nAn ultrasound scan was performed.\nAn initial ultrasound scan demonstrated a stone in the distal \nend of the right parotid duct with evidence of ductal dilation (eFig. 8.294). Assessment of the gland also demonstrated \ndilated ducts within the gland and evidence of intraparotid \nlymphadenopathy.\nThe patient was treated with antibiotics.A course of antibiotics was given to remove the bacteria that \nhad produced the inflammation. On return to the doctor \nsome days later the gland was normal in size and there was no evidence of inflammation or infection.\nAn operation was necessary.\nThe stone was at the distal end of the parotid duct and it \nwould seem logical and straightforward to make a small incision at the sphincter in the buccal mucosa and deliver the stone, thus permitting the gland to drain normally. \nUnfortunately, in this patient\u2019s case the gland was \nsignificantly destroyed by the chronic obstruction and bacterial infection. Furthermore, smaller calculi were also demonstrated in the gland at ultrasound. On direct questioning it appeared that the patient had had numerous \nattacks over the previous 4\u20135 years and it was decided that \nthe parotid gland should be removed surgically.The patient consented for removal of the parotid gland and a discussion of the possibility for loss of facial function and facial paralysis was had with the patient at this time.\nWithin the parotid gland the facial nerve [VII] divides into its \nfive terminal branches. At operation the gland is displayed and extremely careful dissection is necessary to peel away the parotid gland from the branches of the facial nerve [VII]. \nThis procedure was made more difficult by the chronic \ninflammatory change within the gland. After the procedure the patient made a good recovery, though there was some mild paralysis of the whole of the right side of the face. Importantly, taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue \nwas preserved. The taste fibers to the anterior two-thirds of \nthe tongue travel in the chorda tympani nerve, which is a branch of the facial nerve [VII]. This nerve leaves the facial nerve [VII] to join the lingual nerve proximal to the parotid gland; therefore, any damage to the facial nerve [VII] within \nthe parotid gland does not affect special sensation (taste).\nOver the following week the paralysis improved and was \nlikely due to nerve bruising during the procedure. The patient remained asymptomatic.eFig. 8.294  Ultrasound scan (axial view) demonstra ting a stone \nin a dilated parotid duct. \nStone Duct Masseter muscle"

She made an uneventful recovery, but was \nextremely concerned about the nature of her illness and \nwent to see her local doctor.\nA diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made.\nA TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is \na type of stroke.\nNeurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most \ntransient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of \nresolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke.\nAn investigation into the cause of the TIA was  \nundertaken.\nEighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral \ninfarction, of which most are due to embolization.\nA duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was  \nperformed.\nThe majority of emboli originate from plaques that develop \nat and around the carotid bifurcation. Emboli consist of \nplatelet aggregates, cholesterol, and atheromatous debris. \nEmboli may also arise from the heart secondary to cardiac \ntumors or myocardial infarction.\nThe lesion in the brain was on the left side.\nThe motor cortex for the whole of the right side of the body \nis represented in the left motor strip of the brain, which sits \non the precentral gyrus.\nThe duplex Doppler ultrasound scan demonstrated a \nsignificant narrowing (stenosis) of the left internal carotid \nartery with evidence of plaque formation and abnormal flow \nin this region. The narrowing was approximately 90%.Treatment required an operation.\nA carotid endarterectomy (removal of the stenosis and the \natheromatous plaque) was planned. This procedure is \nindicated in the presence of an ulcerating plaque with \nstenosis. The procedure was carried out under general \nanesthetic and a curvilinear incision was placed in the left \nside of the neck. The common carotid, external carotid, and \ninternal carotid arteries were displayed. All vessels were \nclamped and a shunt was placed from the common carotid \nartery into the internal carotid artery to maintain cerebral \nblood flow during the procedure. The internal carotid artery \nwas opened and the plaque excised.\nAfter the procedure the patient did extremely well and \nsuffered no further cerebral events. However, a new medical \nstudent examined the patient the following day and \ndemonstrated a number of interesting findings. These \nincluded altered skin sensation inferior to the left mandible, \naltered sensation on the left side of the soft palate, a \nparalyzed left vocal cord, inability to shrug the left shoulder, \nand a tongue that deviated to the left.\nThe etiology of these injuries was due to localized  \nnerve trauma.\nThis constellation of neurological deficits can be accounted \nfor by trauma to the nerves that are close to the carotid \nbifurcation. The changes in skin sensation can be accounted \nfor by a neurapraxia due to damage to cervical nerves. The \nalteration in sensation in the soft palate is due to neurapraxia \nof the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX]. The paralyzed left cord \nresults from neurapraxia of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, \nwhile the inability to shrug the shoulder is due to \nneurapraxia of the accessory nerve [XI]. Deviation of the \ntongue can be accounted for by damage to the hypoglossal \nnerve [XII].\nMost of these changes are transient and are usually due to \ntraction injuries during the surgical procedure."

She had no other symptoms. On examination \nof the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild \nptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye \nturned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not \npresent.\nThese findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral \nthird nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]).\nThe oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the \nocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain \nand pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the \ncavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial \ncavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital \nfissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and \ninferior divisions.\nThe site of the nerve lesion needs to be assessed.\nThird nerve palsy may involve the nucleus of the oculomotor \nnerve [III], which typically spares the pupil and is painless. \nThe pupillary reflexes are supplied from the autonomic fibers \nof the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus, which pass through the \nciliary ganglion.The lesion cannot be a primary oculomotor nerve [III] \nnuclear injury.\nAs both the pupillary reflexes and vision are affected, the \nlesion is likely to be along the course of the oculomotor \nnerve [III]. Medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and \nvascular disease may produce an isolated oculomotor nerve \n[III] injury, but they are not associated with pain.\nThe lesion was caused by an aneurysm.\nOne of the commonest causes of a third nerve palsy is \npressure on the nerve from a posterior communicating \nartery aneurysm, which lies parallel to the nerve on the \nanterior aspect of the brainstem. As the aneurysm abuts the \noutside of the oculomotor nerve [III], it involves the \nparasympathetic fibers, which lead to a predominance of the \nloss of pupillary function over general function.\nThe aneurysm was imaged with an angiogram.\nThe patient initially underwent CT and MRI scanning. \nCurrently, the definitive test for assessment of aneurysms \narising from the circle of Willis and its branches is a digital \nsubtraction angiogram. The angiogram demonstrated the \nposterior communicating artery aneurysm. The patient \nunderwent surgery and made an excellent recovery.\nCase 7\nRECURRENT EPISTAXIS\nA 10-year-old boy was brought to an ENT surgeon (ear, \nnose, and throat surgeon) with epistaxis (nose bleeding). \nThe bleeding was associated with his nose picking habit. \nHowever, the bleeding was profuse and on two occasions \nrequired hospital admission and nasal packing.\nOn inspection an indurated area was noted.\nThe typical findings are an indurated area in the anterior \ninferior aspect of the nasal septum (Kiesselbach\u2019s area). This \nis a very vascular area that has a considerable number of \nveins, which are often traumatized during nose picking.\nThe patient underwent treatment.\nTypical treatment is cauterization of these prominent veins in \nKiesselbach\u2019s area, which is usually performed by a simple \nlocal analgesia and the application of silver nitrate.\nUnfortunately, the boy was involved in a fight the next day \nand again developed severe epistaxis, which again was \ndifficult to control.Not only is there a rich venous plexus around Kiesselbach\u2019s \narea, but there is also a significant arterial supply, which is \nprovided from the nasal septal branches of the posterior and \nanterior ethmoidal arteries and the branches of the greater \npalatine artery. These are supplemented from the septal \nbranches of the superior labial artery.\nIn most cases treatment is conservative.\nConservative treatment usually involves packing the nasal \ncavity until bleeding has stopped and correcting any \nbleeding abnormality. In patients with bleeding refractory to \nmedical treatment a series of maneuvers have been \nemployed, including ligating the anterior and posterior \nethmoidal arteries through a medial incision in the canthus \norbit, or by ligating other major arteries supplying the nasal \ncavity. Unfortunately, many of these procedures fail because \nof the rich and diverse origin of blood supply to the nasal \ncavity. \n(continues)"

She was not pregnant and \nappeared otherwise fit and well.\nSerum prolactin was measured.Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and \nnecessary for the production of breast milk postpartum. This \nhormone was markedly elevated.\nFurther clinical tests demonstrated visual field defects.The patient went to see an optometrist who performed a \nvisual field assessment and demonstrated a reduction in the \nlateral aspects of the normal visual fields. This was bilateral and symmetrical\u2014a bilateral temporal hemianopia.\nThe visual pathways have now determined the site of the \nlesion.\nVisual information from the temporal fields is projected onto \nthe medial aspect of the retina bilaterally. The visual information from the medial aspects of the retina is carried in fibers that cross the midline through the optic chiasm to \nthe opposite side.\nThe lesion is in the area of the optic chiasm.Any disruption of the optic chiasm produces the field defect \nof bitemporal hemianopia. Tumors of the optic chiasm are \nunusual, though gliomas do occur. More frequently, \ncompression of the optic chiasm by tumors in the vicinity is the usual cause for bitemporal hemianopia.\nA pituitary tumor was diagnosed.\nThe optic chiasm is anterior and extremely close to the \npituitary gland. Given that the patient is producing excessive amounts of prolactin (a pituitary tumor) and there is loss of the function of the chiasm, the most likely clinical \nexplanation is an exophytic pituitary tumor compressing the \noptic chiasm.\nAn MRI scan was performed and demonstrated a large \ntumor (macroadenoma) of the pituitary gland.\nDrug treatment was commenced and the tumor shrank \n(eFig. 8.295). The endocrinological effects of the prolactin secretion also stopped.Follow-up scans were performed.\nOver the ensuing few years the tumor shrank. Unfortunately, \nthe patient again began to secrete prolactin and surgery was \nperformed.\nA transsphenoidal approach was undertaken.With meticulous accuracy a series of very fine instruments \nwas passed through the nasal cavity into the sphenoid bone. \nThe bone was drilled and via this approach the pituitary gland was removed.\nExtreme care must be taken because on both sides of  \nthe pituitary gland is the cavernous sinus through  \nwhich the internal carotid artery, oculomotor nerve [III], \ntrochlear nerve [IV], trigeminal nerve [V], and abducent nerve [VI] pass.\neFig. 8.295  C oronal MRI showing pituitary macroadenoma. \nLateral ventricle Internal carotid artery\nPituitary gland Optic chiasm\nCase 7\u2014cont\u2019d\nDetermination of the specific site of bleeding can be achieved radiologically.\nBy placing a catheter from the femoral artery through the \naorta and into the carotid circulation the sphenopalatine artery can be easily cannulated from the maxillary branch of the external carotid artery. Bleeding can usually be demonstrated and the vessel can be embolized using small particles.\nFortunately in this young boy\u2019s case, bleeding stopped after \nfurther medical management and he remained asymptomatic."

Caudally , the neural tube lengthens and narrows to form the spinal cord. The neural canal forms the cavities of  the ventricular system in the brain and central canal of  the spinal cord (eTable 9.1). The peripheral nervous system consists of  cranial nerves, spinal nerves, spinal ganglia, the enteric system, and autonomic ganglia. The peripheral nervous system is formed by nerve fibers that extend out of  the central nervous system and by neurons and their fibers that develop from migratory neural crest cells (eFig. 9.4A). Like the neural tube, neural crest cells originate from surface ectoderm and initially lie on each side of  the developing CNS.\nTERMS OF ORIENTATION\nSeveral terms are used to identify the orientation and location of  neural structures. The orientation nomenclature is quite simple in organisms such as fish and reptiles, which have a linear nervous system. For these animals, ventral (Latin for \u201cbelly\u201d) is oriented toward the ground, dorsal (Latin for \u201cback\u201d) toward the sky , rostral (Latin for \u201cbeak\u201d) toward the snout, and caudal (Latin for \u201ctail) toward the tail (eFig. 9.5).

Because of  this, directional references such as ventral, dorsal, rostral, and caudal have different meanings along different locations of  the CNS structures (eFig. 9.6A). An additional set of  terms that remain constant in their reference to orienta -\ntion of  nervous system structures are anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior.\nWhen studied through imaging or in histopathology , the \nnervous system is observed in sections cut from one of  three different planes: a coronal plane, which divides the nervous system into anterior and posterior parts; the sagittal plane, which is oriented at a right angle to the coronal plane and divides the nervous system into left and right parts; and a horizontal (also referred to as axial  or transverse ) plane, which \ndivides the nervous system into superior and inferior parts (eFig. 9.6). Note that a sagittal plane passing through the midline may also be referred to as a midsagittal section, whereas a section taken just lateral to the midline is referred to as a parasagittal section.\nCELLULAR COMPONENTS\nNerve cells (neurons) and glial cells are the primary cellular components of  the nervous system. Neurochemical signaling is predominantly carried out through a complex series of  physiological connections between adjoining neurons. Glial cells participate in a constellation of  functions that are vital for proper brain function. Their historically appreciated contribution to neuronal function has expanded to include recognition of  their role in regulating the content of  the extracellular space and regulation of  neurotransmitters at the synaptic junction.\nNeurons consist of  a cell body (or soma), which contains \nthe cell nucleus, short processes called dendrites  for receiving \ninput from other neurons, and long processes called axons, which conduct signals away from the cell body (eTable 9.2). Depending on their location, neuronal morphology can be quite variable. The majority of  mammalian neurons are multipolar, indicating that there are several dendrites from one end and a single axon that branches extensively at its terminus (eFig. 9.7). Some additional neuronal types are bipolar, unipolar, and pseudounipolar (eFig. 9.8).\nTo prevent the loss of  linear signal propagation, glial \ncells form a phospholipid-based layer of  insulation called the myelin sheath along the length of  the axon (eFig. 9.7). \nThe myelin sheath is formed by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. Interspersed between the segments of  myelin are exposed segments of  the axon called nodes of  Ranvier , which have a large population of  voltage-gated ion channels.

The third ventricle communicates with the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of  Sylvius), which courses through the midbrain (eFig. 9.15). Surrounded by the pons and medulla anteriorly and the cerebellum posteriorly , the fourth ventricle sends CSF out of  the ventricular system and into the subarachnoid space via the lateral foramina of  Luschka and midline foramen of  Magendie (eFig. 9.15).\nMENINGES\nWithin the bony encasement of  the skull and vertebral column, the CNS is surrounded by three concentric, con -\nnective tissue coverings called meninges (from Greek word \nmeninx for \u201cmembrane\u201d), which act to support and stabilize the brain and spinal cord. The focus of  this section will be on the cranial meninges. The spinal meninges, which have a slightly different configuration, will be discussed in the \u201cSpinal Cord\u201d section.\nThe outermost covering is the dura (Latin for \u201chard\u201d) \nmater (Latin for \u201cmother\u201d), a tough, fibrous sheet composed of  two layers. The outer periosteal layer is adherent to the skull, and the inner meningeal layer lies against the underly -\ning arachnoid mater (eFig. 9.17 ). Although these two layers \nare closely adherent to one another, they do separate in some regions to form dural venous sinuses, which receive cerebral venous drainage (eFig. 9.18). The anatomy of  the venous sinuses will be discussed in the \u201cCerebral Vasculature\u201d section. Two potential spaces exist as the epidural (extradural) space, superficial to the periosteal layer, and subdural space, deep to the meningeal dural layer. These spaces can become filled with blood during vascular trauma (eTable 9.3). Within the cranial cavity , the meningeal layer of  dura mater folds in on itself  in several areas to form dural reflections, or septa.

The outer layer \nof  the arachnoid mater is composed of  several layers of  flattened cells that lie adjacent to the meningeal layer of  the dura mater (eFig. 9.19). Strands of  connective tissue extend from this outer layer to form arachnoid trabeculae, which connect internally to the pia mater ( eFig. 9.19 ). The \npia mater forms a thin, veil-like layer that closely follows the gyri and sulci on the surface of  the brain. The pia and arachnoid matter are separated by a subarachnoid space that contains CSF and the major blood vessels supplying  \nthe brain.\nCEREBRAL VASCULATURE\nVascular supply to the brain is divided into the anterior circulation arising from the internal carotid arteries and posterior circulation from the vertebral arteries (eFig. 9.20). The internal carotid arteries arise from the branching of  the common carotid arteries at the level of  the fourth cervical vertebra. Bilaterally the arteries course through the neck to enter the middle cranial fossa through the carotid canal. The arteries then make a series of  turns to pass through the petrous portion of  the temporal bone and cavernous sinus before entering the subarachnoid space just lateral to the optic chiasm. Upon exiting the cavernous sinus, the internal carotid artery gives rise to the ophthalmic artery and then continues superiorly to give off  the posterior communicating artery and anterior choroidal arteries before terminating as the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (eFig. 9.21).\nThe two anterior cerebral arteries anastomose proximally \nvia the anterior communicating artery , anterior to the optic chiasm (eFig. 9.22). Distal to this connection, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) courses along the medial aspect of  the cerebral hemisphere within the longitudinal fissure and follows the superior border of  the corpus callosum to the"

Along its course two \nlarge branches arise: the callosomarginal artery , which follows the cingulate sulcus, and the pericallosal artery , which is immediately adjacent to the corpus callosum (eFig.  \n9.23). Given its course and branches, the ACA perfuses most of  the medial aspect of  the brain from the frontal lobe to the anterior portion of  the parietal lobe.\nBranching laterally from the internal carotid artery , the \nmiddle cerebral artery (MCA) penetrates the lateral fissure and gives off  the lenticulostriate striate arteries (eFig. 9.24) before bifurcating into superior and inferior divisions, which loop extensively along the insula and frontal operculum before emerging on the lateral convexity of  the cerebrum.

Also \nat the PCA, a connecting artery , the posterior communicating artery , branches off  and connects to the internal carotid artery (eFig. 9.22).\nVENOUS DRAINAGE\nVenous drainage of  the cerebral hemispheres follows a system of  deep veins, superficial veins, and dural venous sinuses before reaching the internal jugular vein. Before reaching the internal jugular veins, the superficial and deep veins connect to the dural sinuses located between the periosteal and meningeal layers of  the dura. None of  the vessels in this network have valves present in their lumen.\nRunning along the superior edge of  the falx cerebri is \nthe superior sagittal sinus. The superior sagittal sinus continues posteriorly to drain into the transverse sinuses bilaterally (eFig. 9.25A). Each transverse sinus turns inferiorly to form the sigmoid sinus, which exits the jugular foramen to become the internal jugular vein. Along the inferior margin of  the falx cerebri is the inferior sagittal sinus (eFig. 9.25B). Posteriorly , the inferior sagittal sinus joins the great vein of  Galen to form the straight sinus. The point where the straight sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and occipital sinus join is known as the confluence  of  the sinuses \n(eFig. 9.25B). The confluence of  sinuses is drained by the transverse sinuses. Located on either side of  the hypophysial fossa is a plexus of  veins referred to as the cavernous sinus \n(eFig. 9.26). In addition to receiving drainage from the other sinuses, the cavernous sinus also receives the ophthalmic veins. The cavernous sinus is drained by the superior petrosal sinus into the transverse sinus and inferior petrosal sinuses into the internal jugular vein.\nVenous drainage from the superficial veins is primarily \nreceived by the superior sagittal sinus and cavernous sinus. Although the pattern of  superficial veins coursing through the subarachnoid space from the cerebral cortex is quite variable, three veins appear to be fairly constant. Positioned in parallel to the lateral fissure is the superficial middle cerebral vein, which drains into the cavernous sinus from the temporal lobe (eFig. 9.25A). Connecting to the superficial middle cerebral vein perpendicularly is the superior anas -\ntomotic vein (of  Trolard) (eFig. 9.25A). This vein courses superiorly across the parietal lobe to drain into the superior sagittal sinus. Also connecting to the superficial middle cerebral vein perpendicularly is the inferior anastomotic vein (of  Labb\u00e9) ( eFig. 9.25A ).

(From Crossman A. \nNeuroanatomy. 5th ed., Fig. 12.12. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2015.)Part III: Thalamus\nThe thalamus (Greek for \u201cinner chamber\u201d) is a large, egg-\nshaped mass of  gray matter derived from the diencephalon of  the developing brain (see eTable 9.1). The most significant role of  the thalamus is as a synaptic relay for pathways projecting to the cerebral cortex. However, the thalamus also acts as a gatekeeper to prevent or enhance informa-tion transfer, depending on the behavioral state. Sensory , motor, limbic, and modulatory signals from behavioral and arousal circuits all have synaptic relays within the thalamic  \nnuclei.\nBecause of  its location deep within the brain, the thalamus \nis neighbored by several structures and also portions of  the ventricular system. Anteriorly , the thalamus extends forward to contact the interventricular foramen, which connects the lateral and third ventricles (eFig. 9.28). Together, the thalamic nuclear masses and the ventrally located hypo -\nthalamus comprise the lateral walls of  the third ventricle. Immediately lateral to the thalamus is the posterior limb of  the internal capsule (eFig. 9.29). Related to the dorsal aspect of  the thalamus is the body of  the lateral ventricle, and extending caudally is the midbrain portion of  the brainstem (eFig. 9.28). Across the midline of  the third ventricle, the two thalamic masses are interconnected by the interthalamic adhesion.Based on their relationship to the internal medullary \nlamina, a Y-shaped band of  myelinated axons coursing rostrocaudally through the thalamus, the thalamic nuclei are classified into four groups: (1) anterior, (2) medial, (3) lateral, and (4) intralaminar (eFig. 9.30). In addition to this structural categorization, the nuclei are divided into three major functional classes: (1) relay , (2) intralaminar, and (3) reticular. As mentioned earlier, most of  the thalamus is composed of  relay nuclei, which have reciprocal excitatory connections with the cortex. Relay nuclei are further subdivided into specific  and nonspecific  based on their projec -\ntions to specific areas of  the primary sensory and motor cortex or more diffuse cortical projections. The majority of  specific relay nuclei reside in the lateral thalamus\u2014in fact, all sensory modalities, with the exception of  olfaction, have relays in the lateral thalamus before reaching their primary cortical target. Details of  specific and nonspecific nuclei and their cortical connections can be reviewed in eTable 9.4.\nIntralaminar nuclei reside within the internal medullary \nlamina and have numerous reciprocal projections, primarily with the basal ganglia and reticular formation (eFig. 9.30).There are two major functional regions of  the intralaminar nuclei: rostral and caudal. The rostral intralaminar nuclei have reciprocal connections with the basal ganglia and also relay input from the ascending reticular activating system. Caudal intralaminar nuclei, which include the large centromedian nucleus, are predominantly involved in basal ganglia circuitry ."

From rostral to caudal, the brainstem consists of  the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Broadly speaking, the brainstem has three main functions: (1) it is a conduit for tracts ascending and descending through the CNS; (2) it houses cranial nerve nuclei III to XII (note that the CNXI is in the cervical spinal cord); and (3) it is the location for reflex centers related to respiration, cardio -\nvascular function, and regulation of  consciousness.

            "Text": "Neuroanatomy\ne28\nBRAINSTEM INTERNAL FEATURES\nInternal structures of  the brainstem can be identified by \ntheir general location in the tectum (Latin for \u201croof \u201d), tegmentum (Latin for \u201ccovering\u201d), or basis (eFig. 9.34). To identify the structures present in each level of  the brainstem, it is best to view serial sections stained for myelin. This way , nuclear groups and myelinated axons can be more easily distinguished from one another.\nINTERNAL MIDBRAIN\nThe tectum is the most obvious landmark of  the midbrain, as it consists of  the prominent superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, and underlying cerebral aqueduct. Given the short length of  the midbrain, stained serial sections typically include either the superior colliculi, which are located rostrally , or the inferior colliculi, which are caudal. In addition to the superior colliculi, within a rostral section of  the midbrain prominent nuclei such as the oculomotor nuclei, Edinger\u2013Westphal nuclei, red nuclei, mesencephalic nuclei of  cranial nerve V , and substantia nigra can be seen (eFig. 9.35). In caudal sections of  the midbrain the inferior col -\nliculus, trochlear nucleus, mesencephalic nuclei of  cranial nerve V , and substantia nigra are present (eFig. 9.36).\nINTERNAL PONS\nSections from the rostral pons are significant for pontine nuclei and multiple transversely oriented pontocerebellar EXTERNAL MEDULLA OBLONGATA\nThe medulla is the longest portion of  the brainstem, measur -\ning approximately 3  cm in length (eFig . 9.32A). At the rostral \nconnection of  the medulla to the pons, it has a broad conical shape that tapers caudally before connecting with the spinal cord at the level of  the foramen magnum. Along the midline of  the anterior surface is the anterior median fissure, which continues on to the anterior surface of  the spinal cord (eFig.  \n9.33B). Lateral to the fissure are the medullary pyramids composed of  motor fibers descending from the cerebral cortex (eFig. 9.33B). Continuing caudally , the pyramids eventually give way to the decussation of  the pyramids where the majority of  motor fibers decussate to the opposing side. Lateral to the pyramids are the olives, which represent the underlying inferior olivary nuclei. It is at the junction of  the pyramid and the olive that the rootlets of  cranial nerve XII, the hypoglossal nerve, emerge (eFig. 9.33D). Oriented posterior to the olives are the inferior cerebellar peduncles, which form a connection between the cerebellum and medulla (eFig. 9.33D). At the junction of  the olive and inferior cerebellar peduncles from rostral to caudal, rootlets of  cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and XI (spinal accessory) emerge. Like the pons, the posterior surface of  the medulla forms the floor of  the fourth ventricle (eFig. 9.32A). Coursing down the midline of  the posterior medulla is the posterior median sulcus, which continues into the spinal cord. On either side of  the sulcus are the gracile and cuneate tubercles, formed by the underlying gracile nucleus and cuneate nuclei (eFig. 9.32A).\nPyramid\nAB CInferior olivary nucleus Basal pons Cerebral peduncleTectum Tegmentum\nTegmentum\neFig. 9.34  Brainstem cross-sections: rostral medulla (A), rostral pons (B), and rostral midbrain (C).

The basilar artery continues rostrally and terminates as the paired posterior cerebral arteries at the pontomesencephalic junction.\nBefore merging and forming the basilar artery , each \nvertebral artery gives rise to a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and posterior spinal artery and contributes to the formation of  the anterior spinal artery (eFig. 9.42).

The lateral \nfuniculus has a mixture of  axons conveying both sensory and motor information.\nASCENDING TRACTS IN THE SPINAL CORD\nSensory information entering the CNS from peripheral sensory receptors is conducted through a series of  neurons that synapse with targets in the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and other brain structures. The sensory modalities carried in these pathways include pain, temperature, tactile, and proprioceptive input. Conscious perception of  sensory input is transmitted through neuronal pathways, which reach the primary somatosensory region of  the cerebral cortex. In addition to conscious sensory input, there is subconscious sensory input, which is transmitted to other structures such as the cerebellum. For simplicity , in this section we will review the sensory pathways that reach conscious perception and discuss the pathways conveying subconscious sensory input in the section on cerebellum.\nTwo somatosensory pathways ascend within the spinal \ncord to reach the cortex: (1) the anterolateral pathways, which convey sensations of  pain, temperature, and crude touch; and (2) the posterior column\u2013medial lemniscal pathway , which conveys sensations of  discriminative or fine touch, vibration, and conscious proprioception (eFig. 9.51). Both of  these pathways transmit information through zones known as Rexed\u2019s laminae (eFig. 9.50).

We will begin by exploring the tracts of  the lateral motor system first.\nLateral motor systems\nTracts of  the lateral motor system include the lateral cor -\nticospinal tract and rubrospinal tract. Both are located in the lateral column of  the spinal cord white matter and synapse on lower motor neuronal cell bodies in the lateral aspect of  the anterior horn gray matter.\nClinically , the most important tract is the lateral corti -\ncospinal tract, because it is responsible for controlling movement of  the upper and lower extremities. Cell bodies of  upper motor neurons forming this tract are located in the primary motor cortex (eFig. 9.54). Axons of  these upper motor neurons converge in the corona radiata and descend through the posterior limb of  the internal capsule to reach the crus cerebri of  the midbrain. These axons continue through the anterior aspect of  the pons as small bundles to accommodate the transverse pontocerebellar fibers, which are also present in this location. Once the fibers reach the medulla, they are again grouped together and form a large swelling known as the pyramid (eFig. 9.54). At the caudal \nmedulla, before transitioning into the spinal cord, most of  the axons decussate over to the contralateral side to form the lateral corticospinal tract (eFig. 9.54). The remaining axons will stay ipsilateral and form the anterior corticospinal tract, a tract included in the medial motor systems.\nAfter decussating and forming the lateral corticospinal \ntract, the axons descend through the spinal cord to synapse on the cell bodies of  lower motor neurons in the lateral portion of  the anterior horn gray matter. Axons of  these lower motor neurons then exit the spinal cord through the anterior root (eFig. 9.54).\nThe other lateral motor system pathway is the rubrospinal \ntract (eFig. 9.55). Cell bodies of  upper motor neurons in this pathway begin in the red nucleus of  the midbrain. After leaving the red nucleus, the axons cross the midline as the ventral tegmental decussation and descend as the rubrospinal tract through the brainstem and lateral column of  the spinal cord white matter (eFig. 9.55). These axons only descend to cervical regions of  the spinal cord, and axons synapse with interneurons in the anterior horn gray matter to facilitate flexor muscle activity and inhibit extensor muscle activity of  the upper limb.\nMedial motor systems\nTracts of  the medial motor system regulate axial or truncal muscles involved in maintaining posture, balance, automatic gait-related movements, and orientating movements of  the neurons then cross obliquely over two to three spinal cord segments within the anterior commissure of  the spinal cord to join the anterolateral tract on the contralateral side ( eFig.  \n9.52). These second-order axons ascend through the CNS to reach the third-order neuronal cell bodies in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of  the thalamus (eFig. 9.52). Axons from the third-order neurons then project through the posterior limb of  the internal capsule to reach the primary somatosensory cortex (eFig. 9.52).\nThe spinoreticular and spinomesencephalic tracts have \na similar beginning as the spinothalamic tract. The principal difference is the target structure of  the second-order axons. Rather than project to the thalamus as the spinothalamic tract does, the spinoreticular tract projects to the reticular formation in the brainstem to convey the emotional and arousal aspects of  pain (eFig. 9.52), and the spinomesen -\ncephalic tract projects to the periaqueductal gray matter and superior colliculi in the midbrain for the central modula -\ntion of  pain (eFig. 9.52).\nPosterior column\u2013medial lemniscal pathway\nFirst-order neuronal cells bodies of  the posterior column\u2013medial lemniscal pathway are located in a spinal ganglion (eFig. 9.53). Axons then enter the spinal cord through the posterior root to reach either the gracile fasciculus (gracile means \u201cthin\u201d), which carries information from the lower limb and trunk, or the cuneate fasciculus (cuneate means \u201cwedge-shaped\u201d), which carries information from the upper limb and neck. These first-order axons then ascend ipsilater -\nally to the caudal medulla and synapse with the second-order neuronal cell bodies within the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus ( eFig. 9.53 ). Axons of  these second-order neurons \nthen cross over as the internal arcuate fibers to form the medial lemniscus in the contralateral medulla (eFig. 9.53). These second-order axons ascend through the brainstem to reach the third-order neuronal cell bodies in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of  the thalamus (eFig. 9.53). Axons from the third-order neurons then project through the posterior limb of  the internal capsule to reach the primary somatosensory cortex (eFig. 9.53).\nDESCENDING TRACTS IN THE SPINAL CORD\nDescending tracts through the spinal cord are involved in voluntary movements; postural movements; and coordination of  head, neck, and eye movements. These pathways originate from the cerebral cortex and brainstem and are influenced by sensory input and feedback circuitry from the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Structures that influence regulation of  motor planning and voluntary control will be discussed in subsequent sections.

In addition to their role in posture and movement, the basal nuclei have connections to limbic system pathways, which govern the expression of  various behaviors and motivational states.

Rostrally , the head of  the caudate has a large rounded shape that contributes to the lateral wall of  the anterior horn of  the lateral ventricle (eFig. 9.58).

Many structures send input to the striatum, including all areas of  the cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, brainstem, and substantia nigra. To understand how the basal nuclei integrates all of  this incoming information to influence motor activity , two simplified neuronal loops are described: the direct pathway and the indirect pathway .\nThe direct pathway has a series of  connections through \nthe basal nuclei, which result in an overall increase in motor activity . This pathway begins with input to the striatum, which sends axonal connections to the globus pallidus (eFig.  \n9.60A). The globus pallidus then has output connections to the thalamus, which completes the circuit with axonal connections back to the cortex. The indirect pathway has a similar course, with the addition of  output connections to the subthalamic nucleus, which results in an overall decrease in motor activity (eFig. 9.60B)."

It \nresides within the posterior cranial fossa and is composed of  two large hemispheres, which are connected by the vermis in the midline (eFig. 9.61). Functionally , the cerebellum plays a role in maintaining balance and influencing posture and is responsible for coordinating movements by synchroniz -\ning contraction and relaxation of  voluntary muscles. We will first examine the structural organization of  the cerebel -\nlum and then review how these structures contribute to the circuitry of  the cerebellum.\nSTRUCTURES OF THE CEREBELLUM\nWithin the posterior cranial fossa, the cerebellum is covered by the tentorium cerebelli of  the dura mater (eFig. 9.17) and connects to the posterior surface of  the brainstem via the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles (eFig. 9.62). Anteriorly , the cerebellum forms the roof  of  the fourth ventricle ( eFig. 9.14 ). On its surface, the cerebellum \nhas several convoluted folds, or folia, separated by fissures. Two of  these fissures serve as landmarks to divide the cerebellum into three lobes. Superiorly , the primary fissure separates the anterior lobe from the posterior lobe (eFig. 9.61). Anteriorly and inferiorly , the posterolateral fissure defines the structures of  the flocculonodular lobe, which includes the flocculus from each hemisphere and nodule of  the vermis (eFig. 9.63). A third fissure, the horizontal fissure, borders the superior and inferior surfaces of  the cerebellum  \n(eFig. 9.64).\nEach fold or folia of  the cerebellar cortex has a central \ncore of  white matter covered by a thin layer of  gray matter superficially . In sections parallel to the median plane, the branching pattern of  the folia can be appreciated; this is often referred to as the arbor vitae  (eFig. 9.28). Deep within \nthe white matter of  each hemisphere are four masses of  cerebellar nuclei. From lateral to medial they are the dentate, emboliform, globose, and fastigial (eFig. 9.65).

The parallel fibers then synapse on Purkinje cells in the outermost Purkinje cell layer (eFig. 9.67). Climbing fibers project to the Purkinje cell layer and form powerful excitatory connections with the Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cells then project to the deep cerebellar nuclei (eFig. 9.67).\nAFFERENT CEREBELLAR PATHWAYS\nAs mentioned earlier, the cerebellum receives input from the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Input from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum is primarily involved in voluntary muscle control and coordination of  movement. Axonal projections from the cerebral cortex destined for the cerebellum descend through the internal capsule and ter -\nminate on pontine nuclei (eFig. 9.68). The axons from the pontine nuclei then cross over as transverse fibers to enter the interposed nuclei.  Output from the cerebellum originates \nfrom one of  these four nuclear complexes before leaving through the superior cerebellar peduncle, predominantly . In general, the output from each cerebellar hemisphere coordinates movement on the ipsilateral side of  the body .\nFunctionally , the cerebellar cortex can be divided into \nthree areas. The vermis in the midline influences movements along the axis of  the body , including the neck, trunk, abdomen, and pelvis (eFig. 9.66). Adjacent to the vermis, the intermediate zone controls muscles of  the distal upper and lower limbs. The lateral zone participates in motor planning to coordinate sequential movements of  the entire body . Input to these functional areas of  cerebellar cortex come from the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and brainstem by passing predominantly through the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles.

The connections are primarily involved in reflexive main-tenance of  balance. These nuclei send axonal projections to the ipsilateral cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar  \npeduncle.\nEFFERENT CEREBELLAR PATHWAYS\nOutput from the cerebellum originates from one of  the four deep cerebellar nuclei. The largest collection of  fibers leaving the cerebellum originates from the dentate nucleus.

From here, axons of  the thalamic nuclei project to the motor cortex (eFig. 9.70).

Axons leaving the red nucleus descend to the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla.

Before merging and forming the basilar artery , each vertebral artery gives rise to a PICA and posterior spinal artery and contributes to the formation of  the anterior spinal artery (eFig. 9.71). The PICA perfuses the inferior portion of  the cerebellum. At the level of  the caudal pons, the AICA branches off  the basilar artery and perfuses the anterior and lateral portion of  the cerebellum, as well as the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles (eFig.  \n9.71).

After passing through the pupil light is refracted through the lens, which along with the ciliary body , separates the anterior portion of  the eye from the posterior portion (eFig. 9.72). The lens is a clear biconvex structure that rounds in shape as the ciliary muscle contracts and relaxes the suspensory ligaments attached to the borders of  the lens, a parasympathetically controlled process referred to as accommodation.\nAfter the lens, light passes through the vitreous humor \nof  the posterior chamber and is projected onto the layers of  the retina (eFig. 9.73). The retina is composed of  a non-neural layer and several layers of  neural cells with synaptic connections. To reduce the amount of  light reflected in the eye, the choroid layer lining the inner surface of  the sclera (eFig. 9.72), along with the pigment epithelium layer (non-neural) of  the retina, absorb and refract some of  the light stimulus (eFig. 9.73).

In addition to mediating visual perception, these connections are also involved in higher visual functions, such as determining spatial relationships between objects and structural features of  objects. In this section we will explore the primary or geniculate visual pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex.\nAlthough the retinal layer of  the eyeball is often considered \nthe beginning of  visual perception, the anterior structures of  the eye play an important role in visual perception too.

These transversely oriented interneurons moderate the excitation level of  bipolar and ganglion cells.\nCENTRAL VISUAL PATHWAY\nAxons from the ganglion cells coalesce at the optic disc, which is absent of  photoreceptors and thus creates a blind spot in the visual field. As they leave the optic disc they form the optic nerve, acquire a myelin sheath provided by oligo-dendrocytes, and are invested by the cranial meninges (eFig.  \n9.72). These morphological features derived during embry -\nonic development, define the optic nerve as a component of  the CNS. Anterior to the infundibular stalk, the optic nerves converge at the optic chiasm. Within the chiasm, axons from the nasal portion of  the retina decussate and enter into the contralateral optic tract (eFig. 9.75). Con -\nversely , axons from the temporal portion of  the retina stay ipsilateral to enter the ipsilateral optic tract (eFig. 9.75).\nContinuing posteriorly , the optic tracts course around \nthe midbrain to enter the lateral geniculate nucleus of  the thalamus (eFig. 9.75). At this level, a small portion of  the fibers from the optic tract travel to the pretectal area and superior colliculus to mediate the pupillary light reflex. Axons leaving the lateral geniculate nucleus form the epithelial cells, the photoreceptors transduce the light stimulus into an electrical signal in a process called photo-\ntransduction. Images formed on the retina are inverted in both vertical and lateral dimensions (eFig. 9.74). Because of  this, the visual field is defined as having four quadrants: left/right and upper/lower.\nPhotoreceptors include rods, which are very sensitive to \nlight and essential for vision in dimly lit conditions, and cones, which are responsible for color vision and high visual acuity . Although rods and cones are both distributed across the retina, rods outnumber cones by twentyfold and are concentrated in the periphery of  the retina.

The organ of  Corti rests upon the basilar membrane in the scala media, which is filled \nwith endolymph (eFig. 9.80). In addition to contributing \nto the formation of  the scala media with the vestibular membrane, the basilar membrane separates the cochlea into the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, which are filled with perilymph and are continuous with one another at the helicotrema (eFig. 9.80).\nAs the sound waves move through the perilymph they \ndisplace the basilar membrane, which causes deflection of  the hair cells in the organ of  Corti (eFig. 9.81A). These sensory receptors synapse with sensory neurons, which have cell bodies in spiral ganglion located within the modiolus of  the cochlea (eFig. 9.80). Axons leaving the modiolus form the cochlear nerve near the base of  the cochlea. The Part IX: Auditory and  \nvestibular system\nCranial nerve VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve, conveys sensory information from the vestibular and auditory organs of  the inner ear to the pontomedullary junction of  the brainstem. Although these sensory modalities are conveyed to the brainstem by a common nerve bundle, each of  these sensory functions has different central pathways. In this section we will first review the central auditory pathways and then the vestibular pathways.\nAUDITORY PATHWAYS\nSound waves, the auditory stimulus, are directed toward the external acoustic meatus by the pinna of  the outer ear and through the ear canal to the tympanic membrane (eFig.  \n9.79). Vibration of  the tympanic membrane, induced by the incoming sound waves, is transmitted to the three ossicle bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) of  the middle ear. These bones amplify sound waves so they can be converted to \nMiddle ear\nossicles\nVestibule\nBoneSemicircular canals:\nHorizontal Posterior Anterior\nVestibular nerve\nFacial nerve\nBoneCochlear nerve\nEar canal\nBoneCochlea\nauditory\n(Eustachian)\ntube\nNasopharynxRound window Middle ear cavityOval window\nwith stapesDrum\nmembrane\nCartilage\neFig. 9.79  Schematic drawing of the right outer, middle, and inner ear.

These bilateral projec -\ntions are important for auditory acuity and localizing the origin of  a sound. From here, fibers continue to ascend as the lateral lemniscus and terminate in the inferior colliculus of  the midbrain.

It is also believed that the superior olivary nucleus has connections with the motor nuclei of  the tri-geminal and facial nerve to mediate reflexive contraction of  the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles in response to loud sounds.\nVESTIBULAR PATHWAYS\nThe vestibular nerve transmits afferent or sensory informa -\ntion regarding movement and position of  the head from the vestibular organs, which include semicircular ducts, utricle, and saccule. Like the cochlear apparatus, each of  these vestibular organs is located within a membranous (ductal) portion of  the vestibular apparatus, which is surrounded by a bony (canal) portion (eFig. 9.83). The cell bodies for these sensory receptors are located in the vestibular (Scarpa\u2019s) ganglion within the internal acoustic meatus (eFig. 9.83). The vestibular nerve then passes through the internal acoustic meatus and subarachnoid space to enter the pontomedullary junction at the cerebellopontine angle.\nCentral vestibular pathways\nThe central processes of  the vestibular axons predominantly terminate in the four vestibular nuclei (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral), which are located in the rostral medulla and caudal pons (eFig. 9.40). Axons leaving the vestibular nuclei have several ascending and descending synaptic targets. These pathways connect with visual motor, descend -\ning motor, and cerebellar pathways to coordinate movement and maintain posture and balance (eFig. 9.84).\nAxons ascending after leaving the vestibular nuclei form \nthe medial longitudinal fasciculus to reach the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nuclei (eFig. 9.85).

Landmarks for this dividing point are the columns of  the fornix and the mammillothalamic tract as they reside within this sagittal plane (eFig. 9.91). The hypothalamus is also divided by coronal planes into a preoptic area and periventricular zone. Note that the periventricular zone is not to be confused with the paraventricular nucleus, which is a thin region of  cell bodies lying medial to the medial zone.\nLateral zone\nWithin the lateral zone of  the hypothalamus is a large bundle of  axons forming the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (eFig. 9.90). Theses fibers interconnect the hypothalamus with the septal nuclei rostrally and nuclear complexes within the brainstem. Axons arising from the large lateral nucleus in this zone enter the MFB and function in promoting feeding behavior. The other and smaller nuclear group in this zone is the tuberal group. Axons from the tuberal nuclei make connections with the anterior pituitary through the tuber -\noinfundibular tract to regulate release of  hormones in the hypophysial portal system and to the cerebellum to regulate motor activity (eFig. 9.89).\nMedial zone\nThe medial zone is divided into three regions: supraoptic, tuberal, and mammillary . There are four nuclei in the supraoptic region, which play a role in thermoregulation, osmoregulation, and the sleep\u2013wake cycle.

The same receptors that allow us to \nenjoy the food we consume or experience odorants in the environment also help us avoid spoiled food or potentially hazardous situations like a fire. Unlike the other special sensory system pathways, the olfactory sensory pathway is unique in that it does not have a thalamic relay before reaching the primary olfactory cortex. In this section we will review the course of  the neurons in the olfactory system and their connection to the limbic system.\nThree types of  olfactory receptors make up the olfactory \nepithelium along the lateral and septal walls of  the nasal cavity . These cells allow for regeneration (basal stem cells), support (sustentacular cells), and transmission of  informa -\ntion (olfactory receptor neurons). Each olfactory receptor neuron has an olfactory vesicle with cilia that contain receptors for odorant molecules and an unmyelinated axon that passes through the cribriform plate to terminate in the olfactory bulb (eFig. 9.93).

Fitzgerald\u2019s Clinical Neuroanatomy.  7th ed., Fig. 34.1. \nPhiladelphia: Elsevier; 2016.)originate embryologically from the CNS, they are considered \npart of  the CNS and not the PNS.\nAfter synapsing with the mitral cells in the glomeruli of  \nthe olfactory bulb, mitral cell axons converge to form the olfactory tract. The olfactory tract then divides into medial and lateral olfactory striae to reach different synaptic targets (eFig. 9.94). Some of  the axons in the medial olfactory striae travel through the diagonal band to reach the septal area, whereas others cross the midline in the anterior commissure and inhibit mitral cell activity in the contralateral olfactory bulb to enhance localization of  the olfactory stimulant. Axons in the lateral olfactory stria primarily terminate in the piriform cortex/primary olfactory cortex of  the uncus and in the amygdala (eFig. 9.94).\nThe medial forebrain bundle, traveling through the lateral \nhypothalamus, connects the olfactory cortex with both the hypothalamus and the brainstem to regulate autonomic responses such as arousal through the reticular formation, salivation, and gastric contraction.\nLIMBIC SYSTEM\nThe limbic system is composed of  several cortical and subcortical structures that participate in an intricate network of  connections to regulate complicated behaviors such as memory , emotions, homeostatic functions, and motivational state. In this section we will review the major structures and pathways that form the limbic system.\nGrossly , the limbic lobe includes a ring-shaped area of  \ncortical structures that border the brainstem. These cortical areas include the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and subcallosal area (eFig. 9.12). Laterally , the insular cortex also participates in limbic system function (eFig. 9.10). Nuclear structures of  the limbic system include the amygdala, hippocampal formation, anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, septal nuclei in the forebrain, and nucleus accumbens (eFig. 9.95).\nAmygdala\nThe amygdaloid nucleus is an almond-shaped structure located anterior to the inferior horn of  the lateral ventricle and tail of  the caudate within the temporal lobe (eFig. 9.96). Structurally , the amygdala consists of  three nuclear regions: a large basolateral group and a smaller corticomedial group, which includes the central nucleus. Functionally , the amygdala is primarily associated with the emotion of  fear, but it also has an important role in autonomic and neuro -\nendocrine pathways. Connections of  the amygdala are predominantly bidirectional and follow three different pathways: the uncinate fasciculus, stria terminalis, and ventral amygdalofugal pathway (eFig. 9.97). Connections to cortical areas pass through the uncinate fasciculus, which"

Efferent axons leaving the nucleus accumbens project directly to the hypothalamus and globus pallidus and reach nuclei in the brainstem through the medial forebrain bundle. Its connections to the globus pallidus represent an important connection of  the limbic system to the motor system. The overall function of  the nucleus accumbens is recognized as a gratification center and has been shown to play a role in behaviors related to addiction.\nSeptal nuclei\nThe septal region is located rostral to the anterior commis -\nsure along the medial aspect of  the cerebral hemispheres (eFig. 9.99). This region appears to play a role in pleasurable behaviors. Conversely , lesion studies indicate that damage to this area evokes behaviors of  extreme displeasure or rage. Afferent axons to the septal area arise from the amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory tract, and monoaminergic nuclei in the brainstem (eFigs. 9.100 and 9.101). The septal area also connects to a collection of  cholinergic neurons along the wall and roof  of  the third ventricle known as the habenular nuclei. Axons from the habenular nuclei project to the interpeduncular nucleus of  the reticular formation, which is believed to play a role in the sleep\u2013wake cycle  \n(eFig. 9.100).\nHippocampal formation\nThe hippocampal formation is located in the medial ventral temporal lobe ( eFig. 9.102 ).

Input to the hip -\npocampal formation is primarily received by the entorhinal cortex from association cortices. Because of  this, it is believed that the \u201cstorage\u201d of  memories is in the association and primary cortices, not in the medial temporal lobe. Neurons from the entorhinal cortex project to the hippocampal forma -\ntion by two pathways: the perforant pathway and alvear pathway . The perforant courses directly through the hip -\npocampal sulcus to reach the dentate gyrus (eFig. 9.104B). As the hippocampus resembles the appearance of  a ram\u2019s horn, early on it was named cornu ammonis (horn of  Ammon). Based on its cytoarchitecture, it was subdivided into four regions termed the cornu ammonis 1 to 4 (eFig. 9.104A). From the dentate gyrus, axons project to CA3 of  the hippocampus. Axons from the hippocampus leave via the fornix or as Shaffer collaterals to reach CA1. Axons from CA1 may enter the fornix or project to the subiculum. Finally , axons from the subiculum enter the fornix or go back to the entorhinal cortex."

Similar to the perforant pathway , axons leaving the alvear pathway primar -\nily originate from CA1 and CA3, which then project to the subiculum.\nEfferent axons leaving the hippocampal formation primar -\nily exit from the subiculum and form the fornix (Latin for \u201carch\u201d), a white matter structure that arches over the ventricular system (eFig. 9.95). The fornix begins with axons exiting the hippocampus to form the alveus along the ventricular surface of  the hippocampus. As the axons come together medially , they form a bundle referred to as the fimbria of  the fornix. The fornix then emerges from the hip -\npocampal formation and curves under the corpus callosum before coursing medially to run adjacent to the midline (eFig.  \n9.105). At the anterior commissure, the fornix divides into a precommissural fornix and postcommissural fornix to reach the nucleus accumbens, septal nuclei, medial frontal cortex, mammillary nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of  the hypothalamus, and anterior nucleus of  the dorsal thalamus (eFig. 9.95).\nThrough this section we have described a collection of  \nanatomical structures and defined their connections with other areas of  the brain and brainstem without exploring"
