Although the factual basis of anatomy\nis remarkable among basic sciences for its longevity and consistency, this book\nhas evolved markedly since its inception. This is a reflection of changes in the\nclinical application of anatomy, new imaging technologies that reveal living\nanatomy in new ways, and improvements in graphic and publication technology\nthat enable superior demonstration of this information. Efforts continue to make\nthis book even more student friendly and authoritative. The eighth edition has\nbeen thoroughly reviewed by students, anatomists, and clinicians for accuracy\nand relevance and revised with significant new changes and updates.\nKEY FEATURES\nClinically Oriented Anatomy has been widely acclaimed for the relevance of its\nclinical correlations. As in previous editions, the eighth edition places clinical\nemphasis on anatomy that is important in physical diagnosis for primary care,\ninterpretation of diagnostic imaging, and understanding the anatomical basis of\nemergency medicine and general surgery. Special attention has been directed\ntoward assisting students in learning the anatomy they will need to know in the\n21st century, and to this end, new features have been added and existing features\nupdated.\nEXTENSIVE ART PROGRAM\nThe extensive revision of the art program that distinguished the seventh edition\ncontinues into the eighth edition. Most illustrations were revised for the seventh\nedition, improving accuracy and consistency and giving classical art derived\nfrom Grant\u2019s Atlas of Anatomy a fresh, vital, new appearance.

The terminology is available online at\nhttp://www.unifr.ch/ifaa.\nRETAINED AND IMPROVED FEATURES\nStudents and faculty have told us what they want and expect from Clinically\nOriented Anatomy, and we listened:\nA comprehensive text enabling students to fill in the blanks, as time allotted\nfor lectures continues to decrease, laboratory guides become exclusively\ninstructional, and multiauthored lecture notes develop inconsistencies in\ncomprehension, fact, and format.\nA resource capable of supporting areas of special interest and emphasis\nwithin specific anatomy courses that serves the anatomy needs of students\nduring both the basic science and the clinical phases of their studies.\nUpdated organization of the chapters to match that of Grant\u2019s Atlas of\nAnatomy and Grant\u2019s Dissector.\nA thorough introductory chapter (Chapter 1: Overview and Basic Concepts)\nthat covers important systemic information and concepts basic to the\nunderstanding of the anatomy presented in the subsequent regional chapters.\nStudents from many countries and backgrounds have written to express their\nviews of this book\u2014gratifyingly, most are congratulatory. Health\nprofessional students have more diverse backgrounds and experiences than\never before. Curricular constraints often result in unjustified assumptions\nconcerning the prerequisite information necessary for many students to\nunderstand the presented material. The introductory chapter includes efficient\nsummaries of functional systemic anatomy. Students\u2019 comments specifically\nemphasized the need for a systemic description of the nervous system and the\nperipheral autonomic nervous system (ANS) in particular. The eighth edition\nis now the first anatomy textbook to acknowledge and describe the structure\nand function of the enteric nervous system and its unique role in the\ninnervation of the digestive tract.\nRoutine facts (such as muscle attachments, innervations, and actions)\npresented in tables organized to demonstrate shared qualities and illustrated\nto demonstrate the provided information.

Many orientation figures have been\nadded, along with arrows to indicate the locations of the inset figures (areas\nshown in close-up views) and viewing sequences. Labels have been placed to\nminimize the distance between label and object, with leader lines running the\nmost direct course possible.\nBoldface type indicates the main entries of anatomical terms, when they are\nintroduced and defined. In the index, the page numbers of these main entries\nalso appear in boldface type, so that the main entries can be easily located.\nBoldface type is also used to introduce clinical terms in the clinical blue\nboxes.\nItalic type indicates anatomical terms important to the topic and region of\nstudy or labeled in an illustration that is being referenced.\nUseful content outlines appear at the beginning of every chapter.\nCOMMITMENT TO EDUCATING\nSTUDENTS\nThis book is written for health science students, keeping in mind those who may\nnot have had a previous acquaintance with anatomy. We have tried to present the\nmaterial in an interesting way so that it can be easily integrated with what will be\ntaught in more detail in other disciplines such as physical diagnosis, medical\nrehabilitation, and surgery. We hope this text will serve two purposes: to educate\nand to excite. If students develop enthusiasm for clinical anatomy, the goals of\nthis book will have been fulfilled.\nKeith L. Moore\nArthur F.

Wolters Kluwer\nDirector for Art and Digital Content Jennifer Clements has been instrumental to\nthe updating of artistic detail and efficient and accurate labeling in this and the\ntwo previous editions. Rob Duckwall from Dragonfly Media Group revised\nmany of the illustrations for the eighth edition. Photographs taken during a major\nsurface anatomy photography project for the fifth edition continue to be a\ntremendous asset. We are indebted to Joel A. Vilensky, Ph.D., and Edward C.\nWeber, M.D., for providing the many new medical images that appear in the\neighth edition. E.

The three\nmain approaches to studying anatomy are regional, systemic, and clinical (or\napplied), reflecting the body\u2019s organization and the priorities and purposes for\nstudying it.\nRegional Anatomy\nRegional anatomy (topographical anatomy) considers the organization of the\nhuman body as major parts or segments (Fig. 1.1): a main body, consisting of the\nhead, neck, and trunk (subdivided into thorax, abdomen, back, and\npelvis/perineum), and paired upper limbs and lower limbs. All the major parts\nmay be further subdivided into areas and regions. Regional anatomy is the\nmethod of studying the body\u2019s structure by focusing attention on a specific part\n(e.g., the head), area (the face), or region (the orbital or eye region); examining\nthe arrangement and relationships of the various systemic structures (muscles,\nnerves, arteries, etc.) within it; and then usually continuing to study adjacent\nregions in an ordered sequence.\n84"

            "Text": "FIGURE 1.1. Major parts of the body and regions of the lower\nlimb. Anatomy is described relative to the anatomical position\nillustrated here.\nThis book follows a regional approach, and each chapter addresses the anatomy\nof a major part of the body. This is the approach usually followed in anatomy\ncourses that have a laboratory component involving dissection. When studying\nanatomy by this approach, it is important to routinely put the regional anatomy\ninto the context of that of adjacent regions, of parts, and of the body as a whole.\nRegional anatomy also recognizes the body\u2019s organization by layers: skin,\nsubcutaneous tissue, and deep fascia covering the deeper structures of muscles,\nskeleton, and cavities, which contain viscera (internal organs). Many of these\ndeeper structures are partially evident beneath the body\u2019s outer covering and\nmay be studied and examined in living individuals via surface anatomy.\nSurface anatomy is an essential part of the study of regional anatomy. It is\nintegrated into each chapter of this book in \u201csurface anatomy sections\u201d that\nprovide knowledge of what lies under the skin and what structures are\nperceptible to touch (palpable) in the living body at rest and in action. We can\nlearn much by observing the external form and surface of the body and by\nobserving or feeling the superficial aspects of structures beneath its surface. The\naim of this method is to visualize (recall distinct mental images of) structures\nthat confer contour to the surface or are palpable beneath it and, in clinical\npractice, to distinguish any unusual or abnormal findings. In short, surface\nanatomy requires a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the structures\nbeneath the surface. In people with stab wounds, for example, a physician must\nbe able to visualize the deep structures that may be injured. Knowledge of\nsurface anatomy can also decrease the need to memorize facts because the body\nis always available to observe and palpate.\nPhysical examination is the clinical application of surface anatomy.\nPalpation is a clinical technique, used with observation and listening for\nexamining the body. Palpation of arterial pulses, for instance, is part of a\nphysical examination. Students of many of the health sciences will learn to use\ninstruments to facilitate examination of the body (such as an ophthalmoscope for\nobservation of features of the eyeballs) and to listen to functioning parts of the\nbody (a stethoscope to auscultate the heart and lungs).\nRegional study of deep structures and abnormalities in a living person is now\n86"

Diagnostic radiology reveals the effects of trauma, pathology, and\naging on normal structures. In this book, most radiographic and many sectional\nimages are integrated into the chapters where appropriate. The medical imaging\nsections at the end of each chapter provide an introduction to the techniques of\nradiographic and sectional imaging and include series of sectional images that\napply to the chapter. Endoscopic techniques (using a flexible fiber-optic device\ninserted into one of the body\u2019s orifices or through a small surgical incision\n[\u201cportal\u201d] to examine internal structures, such as the interior of the stomach) also\ndemonstrate living anatomy. The detailed and thorough learning of the three-\ndimensional anatomy of deep structures and their relationships is best\naccomplished initially by dissection. In clinical practice, surface anatomy,\nradiographic and sectional images, endoscopy, and your experience from\nstudying anatomy will combine to provide you with knowledge of your patient\u2019s\nanatomy.\nThe computer is a useful adjunct in teaching regional anatomy because it\nfacilitates learning by allowing interactivity and manipulation of two- and three-\ndimensional graphic models. Prosections, carefully prepared dissections for the\ndemonstration of anatomical structures, are also useful. However, learning is\nmost efficient and retention is highest when didactic study is combined with the\nexperience of firsthand dissection\u2014that is, learning by doing. During dissection,\nyou observe, palpate, move, and sequentially reveal parts of the body. In 1770,\nDr. William Hunter, a distinguished Scottish anatomist and obstetrician, stated:\n\u201cDissection alone teaches us where we may cut or inspect the living body with\nfreedom and dispatch.\u201d\nSystemic Anatomy\nSystemic anatomy is the study of the body\u2019s organ systems that work together\nto carry out complex functions. The basic systems and the field of study or\ntreatment of each (italics in parentheses) are as follows:\nThe integumentary system (dermatology) consists of the skin (L.\nintegumentum, a covering) and its appendages\u2014hairs, nails, and sweat\nglands, for example\u2014and the subcutaneous tissue just beneath it.

The Clinical Boxes (popularly called \u201cblue boxes,\u201d appearing on a\nblue background) throughout this book describe practical applications of\nanatomy. \u201cCase studies,\u201d such as those on the Clinically Oriented Anatomy Web\nsite (http://thePoint.lww.com/COA8e), are integral parts of the clinical approach\nto studying anatomy.\nANATOMICOMEDICAL TERMINOLOGY\nAnatomical terminology introduces and makes up a large part of medical\nterminology. To be understood, you must express yourself clearly, using the\nproper terms in the correct way. Although you are familiar with common,\ncolloquial terms for parts and regions of the body, you must learn the\ninternational anatomical terminology (e.g., axillary fossa instead of armpit and\nclavicle instead of collarbone) that enables precise communication among health\ncare professionals and scientists worldwide. Health professionals must also know\nthe common and colloquial terms people are likely to use when they describe\ntheir complaints. Furthermore, you must be able to use terms people will\nunderstand when explaining their medical problems to them.\nThe terminology in this book conforms to the new International Anatomical\nTerminology. Terminologia Anatomica (TA) and Terminologia Embryologica\n(TE) list terms both in Latin and as English equivalents (e.g., the common\nshoulder muscle is musculus deltoideus in Latin and deltoid in English). Most\nterms in this book are English equivalents. Official terms are available at\nwww.unifr.ch/ifaa.

Eponyms, terms\nincorporating the names of people, are not used in the new terminology because\nthey give no clue about the type or location of the structures involved. Further,\nmany eponyms are historically inaccurate in terms of identifying the original\nperson to describe a structure or assign its function, and do not conform to an\ninternational standard. Notwithstanding, commonly used eponyms appear in\nparentheses throughout the book when these terms are first used\u2014such as sternal\nangle (angle of Louis)\u2014since you will surely encounter them in your clinical\nyears. Note that eponymous terms do not help to locate the structure in the body.\nThe Clinically Oriented Anatomy Web site (http://thePoint.lww.com/COA8e)\nprovides a list of eponymous terms.\nStructure of terms. Anatomy is a descriptive science and requires names for\nthe many structures and processes of the body. Because most terms are derived\nfrom Latin and Greek, medical language may seem difficult at first; however, as\nyou learn the origin of terms, the words make sense. For example, the term\ngaster is Latin for stomach or belly. Consequently, the esophagogastric junction\nis the site where the esophagus connects with the stomach, gastric acid is the\ndigestive juice secreted by the stomach, and a digastric muscle is a muscle\ndivided into two bellies.\nMany terms provide information about a structure\u2019s shape, size, location, or\nfunction or about the resemblance of one structure to another. For example, some\nmuscles have descriptive names to indicate their main characteristics. The\ndeltoid muscle, which covers the point of the shoulder, is triangular, like the\nsymbol for delta, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. The suffix -oid means\n\u201clike\u201d; therefore, deltoid means like delta. Biceps means two-headed and triceps\nmeans three-headed. Some muscles are named according to their shape\u2014the\npiriformis muscle, for example, is pear shaped (L. pirum, pear + L. forma, shape\nor form). Other muscles are named according to their location. The temporalis\nmuscle is in the temporal region (temple) of the cranium (skull). In some cases,\nactions are used to describe muscles\u2014for example, the levator scapulae elevates\nthe scapula (L. for shoulder blade). Anatomical terminology applies logical\nreasons for the names of muscles and other parts of the body, and if you learn\ntheir meanings and think about them as you read and dissect, it will be easier to\nremember their names.\n91"

It should also be kept in mind, however, that gravity\ncauses a downward shift of internal organs (viscera) when the upright position is\nassumed. Since people are typically examined in the supine position, it is often\nnecessary to describe the position of the affected organs when supine, making\nspecific note of this exception to the anatomical position.\nAnatomical Planes\nAnatomical descriptions are based on four imaginary planes (median, sagittal,\nfrontal, and transverse) that intersect the body in the anatomical position (Fig.\n1.2):\nThe median plane (median sagittal plane), the vertical anteroposterior\nplane passing longitudinally through the midlines of the head, neck, and\ntrunk where it intersects the surface of the body, dividing it into right and left\nhalves (Fig. 1.2A).

However, a plane parallel and near to the median plane may be\nreferred to as a paramedian plane.\nFrontal (coronal) planes are vertical planes passing through the body at\nright angles to the median plane, dividing the body into anterior (front) and\nposterior (back) parts (Fig. 1.2B, C).\nTransverse planes are horizontal planes passing through the body at right\nangles to the median and frontal planes, dividing the body into superior\n(upper) and inferior (lower) parts (Fig. 1.2C).

Sections of the head, neck, and trunk in precise\nfrontal and transverse planes are symmetrical, passing through both the right and\nleft members of paired structures, allowing some comparison.\nThe main use of anatomical planes is to describe sections (Fig. 1.3):\nFIGURE 1.3.

Extension usually\noccurs in a posterior direction. The knee joint, rotated 180\u00b0 to more superior\njoints, is exceptional in that flexion of the knee involves posterior movement and\nextension involves anterior movement. Dorsiflexion describes flexion at the\nankle joint, as occurs when walking uphill or lifting the front of the foot and toes\noff the ground (Fig. 1.5I). Plantarflexion bends the foot and toes toward the\nground, as when standing on your toes. Extension of a limb or part beyond the\nnormal limit\u2014hyperextension (overextension)\u2014can cause injury, such as\n\u201cwhiplash\u201d (i.e., hyperextension of the neck during a rear-end automobile\ncollision).\nAbduction and adduction movements generally occur in a frontal plane\naround an anteroposterior axis (Fig. 1.5E, G).

Adduction of the digits is the opposite\u2014bringing the spread fingers or\ntoes together, toward the neutrally positioned 3rd finger or 2nd toe. Right and\nleft lateral flexion (lateral bending) are special forms of abduction for only the\nneck and trunk (Fig. 1.5J). The face and upper trunk are directed anteriorly as the\nhead and/or shoulders tilt to the right or left side, causing the midline of the body\nitself to become bent sideways.

Pronation rotates the radius medially so that the palm of the hand\nfaces posteriorly and its dorsum faces anteriorly. When the elbow joint is flexed,\npronation moves the hand so that the palm faces inferiorly (e.g., placing the\npalms flat on a table).

When the elbow joint is flexed, supination\nmoves the hand so that the palm faces superiorly. (Memory device: You can hold\nsoup in the palm of your hand when the flexed forearm is supinated but are\nprone [likely] to spill it if the forearm is then pronated!)\nEversion moves the sole of the foot away from the median plane, turning the\nsole laterally (Fig. 1.5I). When the foot is fully everted, it is also dorsiflexed.\nInversion moves the sole of the foot toward the median plane (facing the sole\nmedially). When the foot is fully inverted, it is also plantarflexed. Pronation of\nthe foot actually refers to a combination of eversion and abduction that results in\nlowering of the medial margin of the foot (the feet of an individual with flat feet\nare pronated), and supination of the foot generally implies movements resulting\nin raising the medial margin of the foot, a combination of inversion and\nadduction.\nOpposition is the movement by which the pad of the 1st digit (thumb) is\nbrought to another digit pad (Fig. 1.5C). This movement is used to pinch, button\na shirt, and lift a teacup by the handle. Reposition describes the movement of the\n1st digit from the position of opposition back to its anatomical position.\nProtrusion is a movement anteriorly (forward) as in protruding the mandible\n(chin), lips, or tongue (Fig. 1.5L). Retrusion is a movement posteriorly\n(backward), as in retruding the mandible, lips, or tongue. The similar terms\nprotraction and retraction are used most commonly for anterolateral and\nposteromedial movements of the scapula on the thoracic wall, causing the\nshoulder region to move anteriorly and posteriorly (Fig. 1.5M).\n102"

Anatomical variation usually has no effect on normal\nfunction. Anatomical variations are often discovered during imaging or surgical\nprocedures, at autopsy, or during anatomical study in individuals who had no\nawareness of or adverse effects from the variation. A congenital anomaly or\nbirth defect is a variation often evident at birth or soon afterward due to aberrant\nform or function. Birth defects also can range from mild to severe. Although\nmany birth defects can be treated, others are fatal. It is important to know how\nsuch variations and anomalies may influence physical examinations, diagnosis,\nand treatment.\nAnatomy textbooks describe (initially, at least) the structure of the body as it\nis most often observed in people, that is, the most common pattern. However,\noccasionally a particular structure demonstrates so much variation within the\nnormal range that the most common pattern is found less than half the time!\nBeginning students are frequently frustrated because the bodies they are\nexamining or dissecting do not conform to the atlas or text they are using\n(Bergman et al., 1988). Often, students ignore the variations or inadvertently\ndamage them by attempting to produce conformity. However, you should expect\nanatomical variations when you dissect or inspect prosected specimens.\nIn a random group of people, individuals obviously differ superficially from\neach other in physical appearance. The bones of the skeleton vary not only in\nsize but more subtly in their basic shape and in lesser details of surface structure.\nA wide variation is found in the size, shape, and form of the attachments of\nmuscles. Similarly, considerable variation exists in the patterns of branching of\nneurovascular structures (veins, arteries, and nerves). Veins demonstrate the\ngreatest degree of variation and nerves the least. Individual variation must be\nconsidered in physical examination, diagnosis, and treatment.\n103"

However, the frequency of variation often differs among human\ngroups, and variations collected in one population may not apply to members of\nanother population. Some variations, such as those occurring in the origin and\ncourse of the cystic artery to the gallbladder, are clinically significant (see\nChapter 5, Abdomen). Being aware of these variations is essential in medical\npractice, particularly surgery. Clinically significant variations are described in\nclinical correlation (blue) boxes identified with an Anatomical Variation icon (at\nleft).\nHumans exhibit considerable genetic variation beyond sexual and racial\ndifferences, such as polydactyly (extra digits). Approximately 3% of newborns\nshow one or more significant birth defects (Moore et al., 2016). Other defects\n(e.g., atresia or blockage of the intestine) are not detected until symptoms occur.\nDiscovering anatomical variations in cadavers is actually one of the many\nbenefits of firsthand dissection, because it enables students to develop an\nawareness of the occurrence of variations and a sense of their frequency.\nINTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM\nBecause the skin (L. integumentum, a covering) is readily accessible and is one\nof the best indicators of general health, careful observation of it is important in\nphysical examinations.

Thus, contraction of\nthe arrector muscles causes the hairs to stand up straighter, thereby compressing\nthe sebaceous glands and helping them secrete their oily product onto the skin\nsurface. The evaporation of the watery secretion (sweat) of the sweat glands\nfrom the skin provides a thermoregulatory mechanism for heat loss (cooling).\nAlso involved in the loss or retention of body heat are the small arteries\n(arterioles) within the dermis. They dilate to fill superficial capillary beds to\nradiate heat (skin appears red) or constrict to minimize surface heat loss (skin,\nespecially of the lips and fingertips, appears blue).

When the blood is not carrying enough oxygen from the lungs, such\nas in a person who has stopped breathing or whose circulation is unable to send\nadequate amount of blood through the lungs, the skin can appear bluish\n(cyanotic). Cyanosis occurs because the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin of blood\nappears bright red when carrying oxygen (as it does in arteries and usually does\nin capillaries) and appears deep, purplish blue when depleted of oxygen, as it\ndoes in veins. Cyanosis is especially evident where skin is thin, such as the lips,\neyelids, and deep to the transparent nails. Skin injury, exposure to excess heat,\ninfection, inflammation, or allergic reactions may cause the superficial capillary\nbeds to become engorged, making the skin look abnormally red, a sign called\nerythema. In certain liver disorders, a yellow pigment called bilirubin builds up\nin the blood, giving a yellow appearance to the whites of the eyes and skin, a\ncondition called jaundice.

Subcutaneous bursae occur in the\nsubcutaneous tissue between the skin and bony prominences, such as at the\nelbow or knee; subfascial bursae lie beneath deep fascia; and subtendinous\nbursae facilitate the movement of tendons over bone.

This\nconfiguration is much like wrapping a large but empty balloon around a\nstructure, such as a fist (Fig. 1.10B). The object is surrounded by the two layers\nof the empty balloon but is not inside the balloon; the balloon itself remains\nempty. For an even more exact comparison, the balloon should first be filled\nwith water and then emptied, leaving the empty balloon wet inside. In exactly\nthis way, the heart is surrounded by\u2014but is not inside\u2014the pericardial sac.\nEach lung is surrounded by\u2014but is not inside\u2014a pleural sac, and the abdominal\nviscera are surrounded by\u2014but are not inside\u2014the peritoneal sac. In such cases,\nthe inner layer of the balloon or serous sac (the one adjacent to the fist, viscus, or\nviscera) is called the visceral layer; the outer layer of the balloon (or the one in\ncontact with the body wall) is called the parietal layer. Such a surrounding\ndouble layer of membranes, moistened on their apposed surfaces, confers\nfreedom of movement on the surrounded structure when it is contained within a\nconfined space, such as the heart within its surrounding fibrous sac\n119"

Surgeons take advantage of these\ninterfascial planes, separating structures to create spaces that allow movement\nand access to deeply placed structures. In some procedures, surgeons use\nextrapleural or extraperitoneal fascial planes, which allow them to operate\noutside the membranes lining the body cavities, minimizing the potential for\ncontamination, the spread of infection, and consequent formation of adhesions\n(adherences) within the cavities. Unfortunately, these planes are often fused and\ndifficult to establish or appreciate in embalmed cadavers.\nThe Bottom Line\nIntegumentary system: The integumentary system (the skin) consists of the\nepidermis, dermis, and specialized structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands,\nand sweat glands).

Cartilage is a resilient,\nsemirigid form of connective tissue that forms parts of the skeleton where more\nflexibility is required\u2014for example, where the costal cartilages attach the ribs to\nthe sternum. Also, the articulating surfaces (bearing surfaces) of bones\nparticipating in a synovial joint are capped with articular cartilage that provides\nsmooth, low-friction, gliding surfaces for free movement (see Fig. 1.16A). Blood\nvessels do not enter cartilage (i.e., it is avascular); consequently, its cells obtain\noxygen and nutrients by diffusion. The proportion of bone and cartilage in the\nskeleton changes as the body grows; the younger a person is, the more cartilage\nhe or she has. The bones of a newborn are soft and flexible because they are\nmostly composed of cartilage.\nBone, a living tissue, is a highly specialized, hard form of connective tissue\nthat makes up most of the skeleton.

All bones have a superficial thin\nlayer of compact bone around a central mass of spongy bone, except where the\nlatter is replaced by a medullary (marrow) cavity.

The humerus (arm bone), for\nexample, begins to ossify at the end of the embryonic period (8 weeks);\nhowever, ossification is not complete until age 20. All bones derive from\nmesenchyme (embryonic connective tissue) by two different processes:\nintramembranous ossification (directly from mesenchyme) and endochondral\nossification (from cartilage derived from mesenchyme). The histology\n(microscopic structure) of a bone is the same by either process (Pawlina, 2016).\nThe two processes of bone development proceed as follows:\nIn intramembranous ossification (membranous bone formation),\nmesenchymal models of bones form during the embryonic period, and direct\nossification of the mesenchyme begins in the fetal period.\nIn endochondral ossification (cartilaginous bone formation), cartilage\nmodels of the bones form from mesenchyme during the fetal period, and\nbone subsequently replaces most of the cartilage.\nA brief description of endochondral ossification helps explain how long bones\ngrow (Fig. 1.14). The mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into\nchondroblasts, dividing cells in growing cartilage tissue, thereby forming a\ncartilaginous bone model. In the midregion of the model, the cartilage calcifies\n(becomes impregnated with calcium salts), and periosteal capillaries (capillaries\nfrom the fibrous sheath surrounding the model) grow into the calcified cartilage\nof the bone model and supply its interior. These blood vessels, together with\nassociated osteogenic (bone-forming) cells, form a periosteal bud (Fig. 1.14A).\nThe capillaries initiate the primary ossification center, so named because the\nbone tissue it forms replaces most of the cartilage in the main body of the bone\nmodel. The shaft of a bone ossified from the primary ossification center is the\ndiaphysis, which grows as the bone develops.\n127"

It is important to know that accessory bones are\ncommon in the foot, to avoid mistaking them for bone fragments in radiographs\nand other medical images.\n Heterotopic Bones\nBones sometimes form in soft tissues where they are not normally present (e.g.,\nin scars). Horse riders often develop heterotopic bones in their thighs (rider\u2019s\nbones), probably because of chronic muscle strain resulting in small\nhemorrhagic (bloody) areas that undergo calcification and eventual ossification.\n Trauma to Bone and Bone Changes\nBones are living organs that cause pain when injured, bleed when fractured,\nremodel in relationship to stresses placed on them, and change with age. Like\nother organs, bones have blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves, and they\nmay become diseased. Unused bones, such as in a paralyzed limb, atrophy\n(decrease in size).

For the fracture to heal properly, the broken\nends must be brought together, approximating their normal position. This is\ncalled reduction of a fracture. During bone healing, the surrounding fibroblasts\n(connective tissue cells) proliferate and secrete collagen, which forms a collar\nof callus to hold the bones together (Fig. B1.4). Bone remodeling occurs in the\nfracture area, and the callus calcifies. Eventually, the callus is resorbed and\nreplaced by bone. After several months, little evidence of the fracture remains,\nespecially in young people.

Knowing the patient\u2019s age and the\nlocation of epiphyses can prevent these anatomical errors. The edges of the\ndiaphysis and epiphysis are smoothly curved in the region of the epiphysial\nplate. Bone fractures always leave a sharp, often uneven edge of bone. An\ninjury that causes a fracture in an adult usually causes the displacement of an\nepiphysis in a child.\n Avascular Necrosis\nLoss of arterial supply to an epiphysis or other parts of a bone results in the\ndeath of bone tissue\u2014avascular necrosis (G. nekrosis, deadness). After every\nfracture, small areas of adjacent bone undergo necrosis. In some fractures,\navascular necrosis of a large fragment of bone may occur. A number of clinical\ndisorders of epiphyses in children result from avascular necrosis of unknown\netiology (cause). These disorders are referred to as osteochondroses.\nJoints\nJoints (articulations) are unions or junctions between two or more bones or rigid\nparts of the skeleton. Joints exhibit a variety of forms and functions. Some joints\nhave no movement, such as the epiphysial plates between the epiphysis and\ndiaphysis of a growing long bone; others allow only slight movement, such as\nteeth within their sockets; and some are freely movable, such as the\nglenohumeral (shoulder) joint.\nCLASSIFICATION OF JOINTS\n137"

            "Text": "Three classes of joints are described, based on the manner or type of material by\nwhich the articulating bones are united (Fig. 1.16):\n1. The articulating bones of synovial joints are united by a joint (articular)\ncapsule (composed of an outer fibrous layer lined by a serous synovial\nmembrane) spanning and enclosing a joint or articular cavity. The joint\ncavity of a synovial joint, like the knee, is a potential space that contains a\nsmall amount of lubricating synovial fluid, secreted by the synovial\nmembrane. Inside the capsule, articular cartilage covers the articulating\nsurfaces of the bones; all other internal surfaces are covered by synovial\nmembrane. The bones in Figure 1.16A, normally closely apposed, have been\npulled apart for demonstration, and the joint capsule has been inflated.\nConsequently, the normally potential joint cavity is exaggerated. The\nperiosteum investing the participating bones external to the joint blends with\nthe fibrous layer of the joint capsule.\n2. The articulating bones of fibrous joints are united by fibrous tissue. The\namount of movement occurring at a fibrous joint depends in most cases on\nthe length of the fibers uniting the articulating bones. The sutures of the\ncranium are examples of fibrous joints (Fig. 1.16B). These bones are held\nclose together, either interlocking along a wavy line or overlapping. A\nsyndesmosis type of fibrous joint unites the bones with a sheet of fibrous\ntissue, either a ligament or a fibrous membrane. Consequently, this type of\njoint is partially movable. The interosseous membrane in the forearm is a\nsheet of fibrous tissue that joins the radius and ulna in a syndesmosis. A\ndento-alveolar syndesmosis (gomphosis or socket) is a fibrous joint in\nwhich a peg-like process fits into a socket, forming an articulation between\nthe root of the tooth and the alveolar process of the jaw. Mobility of this joint\n(a loose tooth) indicates a pathological state affecting the supporting tissues\nof the tooth. However, microscopic movements here give us information (via\nthe sense of proprioception) about how hard we are biting or clenching our\nteeth and whether we have a particle stuck between our teeth.\n3. The articulating structures of cartilaginous joints are united by hyaline\ncartilage or fibrocartilage. In primary cartilaginous joints, or\nsynchondroses, the bones are united by hyaline cartilage, which permits\nslight bending during early life. Primary cartilaginous joints are usually\ntemporary unions, such as those present during the development of a long\nbone (Figs. 1.14 and 1.16C), where the bony epiphysis and the shaft are\njoined by an epiphysial plate.

Hinge joints permit flexion and extension only, movements that occur in one\nplane (sagittal) around a single axis that runs transversely; thus, hinge joints\nare uniaxial joints. The joint capsule of these joints is thin and lax anteriorly\nand posteriorly where movement occurs; however, the bones are joined by\nstrong, laterally placed collateral ligaments. The elbow joint is a hinge joint.\n3. Saddle joints permit abduction and adduction as well as flexion and\nextension, movements occurring around two axes at right angles to each\nother; thus, saddle joints are biaxial joints that allow movement in two\nplanes, sagittal and frontal. The performance of these movements in a\ncircular sequence (circumduction) is also possible. The opposing articular\nsurfaces are shaped like a saddle (i.e., they are reciprocally concave and\nconvex). The carpometacarpal joint at the base of the 1st digit (thumb) is a\nsaddle joint (Fig. 1.17).\n4. Condyloid joints permit flexion and extension as well as abduction and\nadduction; thus, condyloid joints are also biaxial. However, movement in one\nplane (sagittal) is usually greater (freer) than in the other. Circumduction,\nmore restricted than that of saddle joints, is also possible. The\nmetacarpophalangeal joints (knuckle joints) are condyloid joints.\n5. Ball and socket joints allow movement in multiple axes and planes: flexion\nand extension, abduction and adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and\ncircumduction; thus, ball and socket joints are multiaxial joints. In these\nhighly mobile joints, the spheroidal surface of one bone moves within the\nsocket of another. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint in which the\nspherical head of the femur rotates within the socket formed by the\nacetabulum of the hip bone.\n6. Pivot joints permit rotation around a central axis; thus, they are uniaxial. In\nthese joints, a rounded process of bone rotates within a sleeve or ring. The\nmedian atlanto-axial joint is a pivot joint in which the atlas (C1 vertebra)\nrotates around a finger-like process, the dens of the axis (C2 vertebra),\nduring rotation of the head.\nJOINT VASCULATURE AND INNERVATION\n141"

The arteries often anastomose (communicate) to form networks (peri-\narticular arterial anastomoses) to ensure a blood supply to and across the joint\nin the various positions assumed by the joint. Articular veins are\ncommunicating veins that accompany arteries (L. venae comitantes) and, like the\narteries, are located in the joint capsule, mostly in the synovial membrane.\nJoints have a rich nerve supply provided by articular nerves with sensory\nnerve endings in the joint capsule. In the distal parts of the limbs (hands and\nfeet), the articular nerves are branches of the cutaneous nerves supplying the\noverlying skin. However, most articular nerves are branches of nerves that\nsupply the muscles that cross and therefore move the joint. The Hilton law states\nthat the nerves supplying a joint also supply the muscles moving the joint and\nthe skin covering their distal attachments.\nArticular nerves transmit sensory impulses from the joint that contribute to\nthe sense of proprioception, which provides an awareness of movement and\nposition of the parts of the body. The synovial membrane is relatively\ninsensitive. Pain fibers are numerous in the fibrous layer of the joint capsule and\nthe accessory ligaments, causing considerable pain when the joint is injured.

As a result, the articulation\nbecomes increasingly vulnerable to the repeated friction that occurs during joint\nmovements. In some people, these changes do not produce significant\nsymptoms; in others, they cause considerable pain.\nDegenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis is often accompanied by\nstiffness, discomfort, and pain. Osteoarthritis is common in older people and\nusually affects joints that support the weight of their bodies (e.g., the hips and\nknees). Most substances in the bloodstream, normal or pathological, easily enter\nthe joint cavity. Similarly, traumatic infection of a joint may be followed by\narthritis, inflammation of a joint, and septicemia, blood poisoning.\n Arthroscopy\nThe cavity of a synovial joint can be examined by inserting a cannula and an\narthroscope (a small telescope) into it. This surgical procedure\u2014arthroscopy\u2014\nenables orthopedic surgeons to examine joints for abnormalities, such as torn\nmenisci (partial articular discs of the knee joint). Some surgical procedures can\nalso be performed during arthroscopy (e.g., by inserting instruments through\nsmall puncture incisions).

(Those of the former are arranged in tandem; those\nof the latter lie parallel.)\nCONTRACTION OF MUSCLES\nSkeletal muscles function by contracting; they pull and never push. However,\ncertain phenomena\u2014such as \u201cpopping of the ears\u201d to equalize air pressure and\nthe musculovenous pump (see Fig. 1.26)\u2014take advantage of the expansion of\nmuscle bellies during contraction. When a muscle contracts and shortens, one of\nits attachments usually remains fixed while the other (more mobile) attachment\nis pulled toward it, often resulting in movement. Attachments of muscles are\ncommonly described as the origin and insertion; the origin is usually the\nproximal end of the muscle, which remains fixed during muscular contraction,\nand the insertion is usually the distal end of the muscle, which is movable.\nHowever, this is not always the case. Some muscles can act in both directions\nunder different circumstances. For example, when doing push-ups, the distal end\nof the upper limb (the hand) is fixed (on the floor), and the proximal end of the\nlimb and the trunk (of the body) are being moved. Therefore, this book usually\nuses the terms proximal and distal or medial and lateral when describing most\nmuscle attachments. Note that if the attachments of a muscle are known, the\naction of the muscle can usually be deduced (rather than memorized). When\nstudying muscle attachments, act out the action; you are more likely to learn\nthings you have experienced.\nReflexive Contraction\nAlthough skeletal muscles are also referred to as voluntary muscles, certain\naspects of their activity are automatic (reflexive) and therefore not voluntarily\ncontrolled. Examples are the respiratory movements of the diaphragm, controlled\nmost of the time by reflexes stimulated by the levels of oxygen and carbon\ndioxide in the blood (although we can willfully control it within limits), and the\nmyotatic reflex, which results in movement after a muscle stretch produced by\ntapping a tendon with a reflex hammer.\nTonic Contraction\n151"

Concentric (B) and eccentric (C) contractions are\nisotonic contractions in which the muscle changes length:\nconcentric contractions by shortening and eccentric contractions\nby actively controlled lengthening (relaxation).\nThere are two types of isotonic contractions. The type we most commonly think\nof is concentric contraction, in which movement occurs as a result of the\nmuscle shortening\u2014for example, when lifting a cup, pushing a door, or striking\na blow. The ability to apply exceptional force by means of concentric contraction\noften is what distinguishes an athlete from an amateur. The other type of isotonic\ncontraction is eccentric contraction, in which a contracting muscle lengthens\u2014\nthat is, it undergoes a controlled and gradual relaxation while continually\nexerting a (diminishing) force, like playing out a rope. Although people are\ngenerally not as aware of them, eccentric contractions are as important as\nconcentric contractions for coordinated, functional movements such as walking,\nrunning, and setting objects (or one\u2019s self) down.\nOften, when the main muscle of a particular movement (the prime mover) is\nundergoing a concentric contraction, its antagonist is undergoing a coordinated\neccentric contraction. In walking, we contract concentrically to pull our center of\ngravity forward, and then as it passes ahead of the limb, we contract\neccentrically to prevent a lurching during the transfer of weight to the other limb.\nEccentric contractions require less metabolic energy at the same load but, with a\nmaximal contraction, are capable of generating much higher tension levels than\nconcentric contractions\u2014as much as 50% higher (Marieb, 2016).\nWhereas the structural unit of a muscle is a skeletal striated muscle fiber, the\nfunctional unit of a muscle is a motor unit, consisting of a motor neuron and the\nmuscle fibers it controls (Fig. 1.21). When a motor neuron in the spinal cord is\nstimulated, it initiates an impulse that causes all the muscle fibers supplied by\nthat motor unit to contract simultaneously. The number of muscle fibers in a\nmotor unit varies from one to several hundred. The number of fibers varies\naccording to the size and function of the muscle. Large motor units, in which one\nneuron supplies several hundred muscle fibers, are in the large trunk and thigh\nmuscles. In smaller eye and hand muscles, where precision movements are\nrequired, the motor units include only a few muscle fibers. Movement (phasic\ncontraction) results from the activation of an increasing number of motor units,\n154"

In most movements, there is a single prime mover, but some\nmovements involve two prime movers working in equal measure.\nA fixator steadies the proximal parts of a limb through isometric contraction\nwhile movements are occurring in distal parts.\nA synergist complements the action of a prime mover. It may directly assist\na prime mover, providing a weaker or less mechanically advantaged\ncomponent of the same movement, or it may assist indirectly, by serving as a\nfixator of an intervening joint when a prime mover passes over more than\none joint, for example. It is not unusual to have several synergists assisting a\nprime mover in a particular movement.\nAn antagonist is a muscle that opposes the action of another muscle. A\nprimary antagonist directly opposes the prime mover, but synergists may also\nbe opposed by secondary antagonists. As the active movers concentrically\ncontract to produce a movement, antagonists eccentrically contract, relaxing\nprogressively in coordination to produce a smooth movement.\nThe same muscle may act as a prime mover, antagonist, synergist, or fixator\nunder different conditions. Note also that the actual prime mover in a given\nposition may be gravity. In such cases, a paradoxical situation may exist in\nwhich the prime mover usually described as being responsible for the movement\nis inactive (passive), while the controlled relaxation (eccentric contraction) of the\nantigravity antagonist(s) is the active (energy requiring) component in the\nmovement. An example is lowering (adducting) the upper limbs from the\nabducted position (stretched out laterally at 90\u00b0 to the trunk) when standing erect\n(Fig. 1.20C). The prime mover (adductor) is gravity; the muscles described as\nthe prime movers for this movement (pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi) are\ninactive or passive; and the muscle being actively innervated (contracting\neccentrically) is the deltoid (an abductor, typically described as the antagonist for\nthis movement).\nWhen a muscle\u2019s pull is exerted along a line that parallels the axis of the\nbones to which it is attached, it is at a disadvantage for producing movement.\nInstead it acts to maintain contact between the articular surfaces of the joint it\ncrosses (i.e., it resists dislocating forces); this type of muscle is a shunt muscle.\nFor example, when the arms are at one\u2019s sides, the deltoid functions as a shunt\nmuscle.

In the limb, muscles of similar actions are generally contained\nwithin a common fascial compartment and share innervation by the same nerves\n(Fig. 1.9); therefore, you should learn the innervation of limb muscles in terms of\nthe functional groups, making it necessary to memorize only the exceptions.\nNerves supplying skeletal muscles (motor nerves) usually enter the fleshy\nportion of the muscle (vs. the tendon), almost always from the deep aspect (so\nthe nerve is protected by the muscle it supplies). The few exceptions will be\npointed out later in the text. When a nerve pierces a muscle, by passing through\nits fleshy portion or between its two heads of attachment, it usually supplies that\nmuscle. Exceptions are the sensory branches that innervate the skin of the back\nafter penetrating the superficial muscles of the back.\nThe blood supply of muscles is not as constant as the nerve supply and is\nusually multiple. Arteries generally supply the structures they contact. Thus, you\nshould learn the course of the arteries and deduce that a muscle is supplied by all\nthe arteries in its vicinity.\nCLINICAL BOX\nSKELETAL MUSCLES\n Muscle Testing\nMuscle testing helps examiners diagnose nerve injuries.

Usually, muscles are tested in\nbilateral pairs for comparison.\nElectromyography (EMG), the electrical stimulation of muscles, is another\nmethod for testing muscle action. The examiner places surface electrodes over a\nmuscle, asks the person to perform certain movements, and then amplifies and\nrecords the differences in electrical action potentials of the muscles. A normal\nresting muscle shows only a baseline activity (muscle tone), which disappears\nonly during deep sleep, during paralysis, and when under anesthesia.\nContracting muscles demonstrate variable peaks of phasic activity. EMG makes\nit possible to analyze the activity of an individual muscle during different\nmovements.

When a muscle is denervated (loses its nerve supply), it becomes\nparalyzed (flaccid, lacking both its tonus and its ability to contract phasically on\ndemand or reflexively). In the absence of a muscle\u2019s normal tonus, that of\nopposing (antagonist) muscle(s) may cause a limb to assume an abnormal\nresting position. In addition, the denervated muscle will become fibrotic and\nlose its elasticity, also contributing to the abnormal position at rest.\n Muscle Soreness and \u201cPulled\u201d Muscles\nEccentric contractions that are either excessive or associated with a novel task\nare often the cause of delayed-onset muscle soreness. Thus, walking down\nmany flights of stairs would actually result in more soreness, owing to the\neccentric contractions, than walking up the same flights of stairs. The muscle\nstretching that occurs during the lengthening type of eccentric contraction\nappears to be more likely to produce microtears in the muscles and/or periosteal\nirritation than that associated with concentric contraction (shortening of the\nmuscle belly).\nSkeletal muscles are limited in their ability to lengthen. Usually, muscles\ncannot elongate beyond one third of their resting length without sustaining\ndamage. This is reflected in their attachments to the skeleton, which usually do\nnot permit excessive lengthening. An exception is the hamstring muscles of the\nposterior thigh. When the knee is extended, the hamstrings typically reach their\nmaximum length before the hip is fully flexed (i.e., flexion at the hip is limited\nby the hamstring\u2019s ability to elongate). Undoubtedly, this, as well as forces\nrelated to their eccentric contraction, explains why hamstring muscles are\n\u201cpulled\u201d (sustain tears) more commonly than other muscles (Fig. B1.8).\n159"

Satellite cells represent a potential\nsource of myoblasts, precursors of muscle cells, which are capable of fusing\nwith each other to form new skeletal muscle fibers if required (Pawlina, 2016).\nThe number of new fibers that can be produced is insufficient to compensate for\nmajor muscle degeneration or trauma. Instead of becoming regenerated\neffectively, the new skeletal muscle is composed of a disorganized mixture of\nmuscle fibers and fibrous scar tissue. Skeletal muscles are able to grow larger in\nresponse to frequent strenuous exercise, such as body building. This growth\nresults from hypertrophy of existing fibers, not from the addition of new muscle\nfibers. Hypertrophy lengthens and increases the myofibrils within the muscle\nfibers (see Fig. 1.21), thereby increasing the amount of work the muscle can\nperform.\nCardiac Striated Muscle\nCardiac striated muscle forms the muscular wall of the heart, the myocardium.\nSome cardiac muscle is also present in the walls of the aorta, pulmonary vein,\nand superior vena cava. Cardiac striated muscle contractions are not under\nvoluntary control. Heart rate is regulated intrinsically by a pacemaker, an\nimpulse-conducting system composed of specialized cardiac muscle fibers; they,\nin turn, are influenced by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (discussed later\nin this chapter).

Consequently, it occurs in all vascularized tissue. It also makes\nup the muscular parts of the walls of the alimentary tract and ducts. Smooth\nmuscle is found in skin, forming the arrector muscles of hairs associated with\nhair follicles (Fig. 1.6), and in the eyeball, where it controls lens thickness and\npupil size.\nLike cardiac striated muscle, smooth muscle is involuntary muscle; however,\nit is directly innervated by the ANS. Its contraction can also be initiated by\nhormonal stimulation or by local stimuli, such as stretching. Smooth muscle\nresponds more slowly than striated muscle and with a delayed and more leisurely\ncontraction. It can undergo partial contraction for long periods and has a much\ngreater ability than striated muscle to elongate without suffering paralyzing\ninjury. Both of these factors are important in regulating the size of sphincters and\nthe caliber of the lumina (interior spaces) of tubular structures (e.g., blood\nvessels or intestines).

Muscle cells that degenerate are not replaced, because cardiac muscle\ncells do not divide. Furthermore, there is no equivalent to the satellite cells of\nskeletal muscle that can produce new cardiac muscle fibers.\n Hypertrophy and Hyperplasia of Smooth\nMuscle\nSmooth muscle cells undergo compensatory hypertrophy in response to\nincreased demands. Smooth muscle cells in the uterine wall during pregnancy\nincrease not only in size but also in number (hyperplasia) because these cells\nretain the capacity for cell division.

Most of the\nnamed arteries, including those observed in the body wall and limbs during\ndissection such as the brachial or femoral arteries, are medium muscular\narteries.\nSmall arteries and arterioles have relatively narrow lumina and thick\nmuscular walls. The degree of filling of the capillary beds and level of\narterial pressure within the vascular system are regulated mainly by the\ndegree of tonus (firmness) in the smooth muscle of the arteriolar walls. If the\ntonus is above normal, hypertension (high blood pressure) results. Small\narteries are usually not named or specifically identified during dissection, and\narterioles can be observed only under magnification.\n168"

However, collateral pathways require time to open adequately; they\nare usually insufficient to compensate for sudden occlusion or ligation.\nThere are areas, however, where collateral circulation does not exist or is\ninadequate to replace the main channel. Arteries that do not anastomose with\nadjacent arteries are true (anatomic) terminal arteries (end arteries). Occlusion\nof an end artery interrupts the blood supply to the structure or segment of an\norgan it supplies. True terminal arteries supply the retina, for example, where\nocclusion will result in blindness.

The large pulmonary\nveins are atypical in that they carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the\nheart. Because of the lower blood pressure in the venous system, the walls\n(specifically, the tunica media) of veins are thinner than those of their\ncompanion arteries (Fig. 1.23). Normally, veins do not pulsate and do not squirt\nor spurt blood when severed. There are three sizes of veins:\nVenules are the smallest veins. Venules drain capillary beds and join similar\nvessels to form small veins. Magnification is required to observe venules.\nSmall veins are the tributaries of larger veins that unite to form venous\nplexuses (networks of veins), such as the dorsal venous arch of the foot (Fig.\n1.24B). Small veins are unnamed.\nMedium veins drain venous plexuses and accompany medium arteries. In\nthe limbs, and in some other locations where the flow of blood is opposed by\nthe pull of gravity, the medium veins have valves. Venous valves are cusps\n(passive flaps) of endothelium with cup-like valvular sinuses that fill from\nabove. When they are full, the valve cusps occlude the lumen of the vein,\nthereby preventing reflux of blood distally, making flow unidirectional\n(toward the heart but not in the reverse direction; see Fig. 1.26).

Capillaries are generally\narranged in capillary beds, networks that connect the arterioles and venules\n(Fig. 1.23). The blood enters the capillary beds through arterioles that control the\nflow and is drained from them by venules.\nAs the hydrostatic pressure in the arterioles forces blood into and through the\ncapillary bed, it also forces fluid containing oxygen, nutrients, and other cellular\nmaterials out of the blood at the arterial end of the capillary bed (upstream) into\nthe extracellular spaces, allowing exchange with cells of the surrounding tissue.\nCapillary walls are relatively impermeable, however, to plasma proteins.\nDownstream, at the venous end of the capillary bed, most of this ECF\u2014now\ncontaining waste products and carbon dioxide\u2014is reabsorbed into the blood as a\nresult of the osmotic pressure from the higher concentrations of proteins within\nthe capillary.

This\nis accomplished by several means having different effects. Blood vessels\nthroughout the body are tonically innervated by sympathetic nerves, maintaining\na resting state of moderate vasoconstriction. In most vascular beds, an increase in\nsympathetic signals causes increased vasoconstriction, and a decrease in the rate\nof sympathetic signals allows vasodilation. However, in certain regions of the\nbody, sympathetic signals are vasodilatory (i.e., sympathetic transmitter\nsubstances inhibit active vasoconstriction, allowing the blood vessels to be\npassively dilated by the blood pressure). In the coronary vessels, the vessels of\nskeletal muscles, and the external genitalia, sympathetic stimulation results in\nvasodilation (Wilson-Pauwels et al., 1997).\nVISCERAL SENSATION\nVisceral afferent fibers have important relationships to the ANS, both\nanatomically and functionally. We are usually unaware of the sensory input of\nthese fibers, which provides information about the condition of the body\u2019s\ninternal environment. This information is integrated in the CNS, often triggering\nvisceral or somatic reflexes or both. Visceral reflexes regulate blood pressure\nand chemistry by altering such functions as heart and respiratory rates and\nvascular resistance.\nVisceral sensation that reaches a conscious level is generally perceived as\npain that is either poorly localized or felt as cramps or that may convey a feeling\nof hunger, fullness, or nausea. Surgeons operating on patients who are under\nlocal anesthesia may handle, cut, clamp, or even burn (cauterize) visceral organs\nwithout evoking conscious sensation.

Transvaginal sonography permits the positioning of the transducer\ncloser to the organ of interest (e.g., the ovary) and avoids fat and gas, which\nabsorb or reflect sound waves. Bone reflects nearly all ultrasound waves,\nwhereas air conducts them poorly.

It has also become a standard\nmethod of evaluating the growth and development of the embryo and fetus.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides images of the body similar to\nthose of CT scans, but MRI is better for tissue differentiation.

Significant motion occurs only between the 25 superior vertebrae. Of\nthe 9 inferior vertebrae, the 5 sacral vertebrae are fused in adults to form the\nsacrum, and after approximately age 30, the 4 coccygeal vertebrae fuse to form\nthe coccyx. The lumbosacral angle occurs at the junction of the long axes of the\nlumbar region of the vertebral column and sacrum (Fig. 2.1D). The vertebrae\ngradually become larger as the column descends to the sacrum and then become\nprogressively smaller toward the apex of the coccyx (Fig. 2.1A\u2013D). The change\nin size is related to the fact that successive vertebrae bear increasing amounts of\nthe body\u2019s weight as the column descends. The vertebrae reach maximum size\nimmediately superior to the sacrum, which transfers the weight to the pelvic\ngirdle at the sacro-iliac joints.\nThe vertebral column is flexible because it consists of many relatively small\nbones, called vertebrae (singular = vertebra), that are separated by resilient IV\ndiscs (Fig. 2.1D). The 25 cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and first sacral vertebrae\nalso articulate at synovial zygapophysial (facet) joints (Fig. 2.2D), which\nfacilitate and control the vertebral column\u2019s flexibility. Although the movement\nbetween two adjacent vertebrae is small, in aggregate the vertebrae and IV discs\nuniting them form a remarkably flexible yet rigid column that protects the spinal\ncord it surrounds.\nStructure and Function of Vertebrae\nVertebrae vary in size and other characteristics from one region of the vertebral\ncolumn to another and to a lesser degree within each region; however, their basic\nstructure is the same. A typical vertebra (Fig. 2.2) consists of a vertebral body,\na vertebral arch, and seven processes.\n252"

The vertebral\nbody includes the centrum and part of the neural arch; the vertebral arch is thus\nless extensive than the neural arch, and the centrum is less extensive than the\nvertebral body (O\u2019Rahilly, 1986; Standring, 2016).\nThe vertebral body is the more massive, roughly cylindrical, anterior part of\nthe bone that gives strength to the column and supports body weight. The size of\nthe bodies increases as the column descends, most markedly from T4 inferiorly,\nas each bears progressively greater body weight.\nThe vertebral body consists of vascular, trabecular (spongy, cancellous) bone\nenclosed by a thin external layer of compact bone (Fig. 2.3). The trabecular\nbone is a meshwork of mostly tall vertical trabeculae intersecting with short,\nhorizontal trabeculae. The spaces between the trabeculae are occupied by red\nbone marrow that is among the most actively hematopoietic (blood-forming)\ntissues of the mature individual. One or more large foramina in the posterior\nsurface of the vertebral body accommodate basivertebral veins that drain the\nmarrow (see Fig. 2.26).\nFIGURE 2.3 Internal aspects of vertebral bodies and vertebral\ncanal.

The anterior rami of the cervical spinal nerves course initially on the\ntransverse processes in grooves for spinal nerves between the tubercles (Fig.\n2.5A, B). The anterior tubercles of vertebra C6 are called carotid tubercles (Fig.\n2.5A) because the common carotid arteries may be compressed here, in the\ngroove between the tubercle and body, to control bleeding from these vessels.\nBleeding may continue because of the carotid\u2019s multiple anastomoses of distal\nbranches with adjacent and contralateral branches, but at a slower rate.\nVertebrae C3\u2013C7 are typical cervical vertebrae (Figs. 2.4A and 2.5A; Table\n2.1). They have large vertebral foramina to accommodate the cervical\nenlargement of the spinal cord as a consequence of this region\u2019s role in the\ninnervation of the upper limbs. The superior borders of the transversely\nelongated bodies of the cervical vertebrae are elevated posteriorly and especially\nlaterally, but they are depressed anteriorly, resembling somewhat a sculpted seat.\nThe inferior border of the body of the superiorly placed vertebra is\nreciprocally shaped.

The\nlateral line is the anterior aspect of the joint, and the medial line\nis the posterior aspect.\nSACRUM\nThe wedged-shaped sacrum (L. sacred bone) is usually composed of five fused\nsacral vertebrae in adults (Fig. 2.10). It is located between the hip bones and\nforms the roof and posterosuperior wall of the posterior half of the pelvic cavity.\nThe triangular shape of the sacrum results from the rapid decrease in the size of\nthe inferior lateral masses of the sacral vertebrae during development. The\ninferior half of the sacrum is not weight bearing; therefore, its bulk is diminished\nconsiderably. The sacrum provides strength and stability to the pelvis and\ntransmits the weight of the body to the pelvic girdle, the bony ring formed by the\nhip bones and sacrum, to which the lower limbs are attached (see Fig. 7.3).\nThe sacral canal is the continuation of the vertebral canal in the sacrum\n(Fig. 2.10B, C). It contains the bundle of spinal nerve roots arising inferior to the\nL1 vertebra, known as the cauda equina (L. horsetail), that descend past the\ntermination of the spinal cord. On the pelvic and posterior surfaces of the sacrum\nbetween its vertebral components are typically four pairs of sacral foramina for\nthe exit of the posterior and anterior rami of the spinal nerves (Fig. 2.10A\u2013D).\nThe anterior (pelvic) sacral foramina are larger than the posterior (dorsal) ones.\nThe base of the sacrum is formed by the superior surface of the S1 vertebra\n(Fig. 2.10A). Its superior articular processes articulate with the inferior articular\nprocesses of the L5 vertebra. The anterior projecting edge of the body of the S1\nvertebra is the sacral promontory (L. mountain ridge), an important obstetrical\nlandmark (see Chapter 6, Pelvis and Perineum). The apex of the sacrum, its\ntapering inferior end, has an oval facet for articulation with the coccyx.\nThe sacrum supports the vertebral column and forms the posterior part of the\nbony pelvis. The sacrum is tilted so that it articulates with the L5 vertebra at the\nlumbosacral angle (Fig. 2.1D), which varies from 130\u00b0 to 160\u00b0.

Fusion of the sacral\nvertebrae starts after age 20; however, most of the IV discs remain unossified up\nto or beyond middle life.\nThe dorsal surface of the sacrum is rough, convex, and marked by five\nprominent longitudinal ridges (Fig. 2.10B). The central ridge, the median sacral\ncrest, represents the fused rudimentary spinous processes of the superior three or\nfour sacral vertebra; S5 does not have a spinous process. The intermediate\nsacral crests represent the fused articular processes, and the lateral sacral\ncrests are the tips of the transverse processes of the fused sacral vertebrae.\nThe clinically important features of the dorsal surface of the sacrum are the\ninverted U-shaped sacral hiatus and the sacral cornua (L. horns). The sacral\nhiatus results from the absence of the laminae and spinous process of S5 and\nsometimes S4. The sacral hiatus leads into the sacral canal. Its depth varies,\ndepending on how much of the spinous process and laminae of S4 are present.\nThe sacral cornua, representing the inferior articular processes of S5 vertebra,\nproject inferiorly on each side of the sacral hiatus and are a helpful guide to its\nlocation.\nThe superior part of the lateral surface of the sacrum looks somewhat like\nan auricle (L. external ear).

Three primary ossification\ncenters develop in each cartilaginous vertebra: an endochondral centrum, which\nwill eventually constitute most of the body of the vertebra, and two perichondral\ncenters, one in each half of the neural arch (Fig. 2.12B, D, G, J, and M).\nOssification continues throughout the fetal period. At birth, typical vertebrae\nand the superiormost sacral vertebrae consist of three bony parts united by\nhyaline cartilage. The inferior sacral vertebrae and all the coccygeal vertebrae\nare still entirely cartilaginous; they ossify during infancy. The halves of the\nneural arches articulate at neurocentral joints, which are primary cartilaginous\njoints (Fig. 2.12G).

In addition,\nbecause of the cervical transverse processes being formed from the two\ndevelopmental elements, the transverse processes of cervical vertebrae end\nlaterally in an anterior tubercle (from the costal element) and a posterior\ntubercle (from the transverse element). The atypical morphology of vertebrae C1\nand C2 is also established during development. The centrum of C1 becomes\nfused to that of C2 and loses its peripheral connection to the remainder of C1,\nthus forming the dens (Fig. 2.12C). Since these first two centra are fused and are\nnow part of C2, no IV disc is formed between C1 and C2 to connect them. The\npart of the body that remains with C1 is represented by the anterior arch and\ntubercle of C1.\nIn the thoracic region, the costal elements separate from the developing\nvertebrae and elongate into ribs, and the transverse elements alone form the\ntransverse processes (Fig. 2.12I).\nAll but the base of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae develop\nfrom the costal element (Fig. 2.12J). This projecting bar of the mature bone is\ntherefore called the costal process. The transverse elements of the lumbar\nvertebrae form the mammillary processes.\nThe ala and auricular surfaces of the sacrum are formed by the fusion of the\ntransverse and costal elements.\nVariations in Vertebrae\nMost people have 33 vertebrae, but developmental errors may result in 32 or 34\nvertebrae (Fig. 2.13). Estimates of the frequency of abnormal numbers of\nvertebrae superior to the sacrum (the normal number is 24) range between 5%\nand 12%. Variations in vertebrae are affected by race, gender, and\ndevelopmental factors (genetic and environmental). An increased number of\nvertebrae occur more often in males and a reduced number occurs more\nfrequently in females. Some races show more variation in the number of\nvertebrae. Variations in the number of vertebrae may be clinically important. An\nincreased length of the presacral region of the vertebral column increases the\nstrain on the inferior part of the lumbar region of the column owing to the\nincreased leverage. However, most numerical variations are detected incidentally\nduring diagnostic medical imaging studies being performed for other reasons and\nduring dissections and autopsies of persons with no history of back problems.\n278"

This structure may vary in size from a\nsmall protuberance to a complete rib that occurs bilaterally about 60% of the\ntime.\nThe supernumerary (extra) rib or a fibrous connection extending from its\ntip to the first thoracic rib may elevate and place pressure on structures that\nemerge from the superior thoracic aperture, notably the subclavian artery or\ninferior trunk of the brachial plexus, and may cause thoracic outlet syndrome.\n Caudal Epidural Anesthesia\nIn living persons, the sacral hiatus is closed by the membranous sacrococcygeal\nligament, which is pierced by the filum terminale (a connective tissue strand\nextending from the tip of the spinal cord to the coccyx). Deep (superior) to the\nligament, the epidural space of the sacral canal is filled with fatty connective\ntissue (Fig. B2.7A). In caudal epidural anesthesia or analgesia, anesthetic or\nanalgesic agents are injected into the fat of the sacral canal that surrounds the\nproximal portions of the sacral nerves. This can be accomplished by several\nroutes, including the sacral hiatus (Fig. B2.7B, C). Because the sacral hiatus is\nlocated between the sacral cornua and inferior to the S4 spinous process or\nmedian sacral crest, these palpable bony landmarks are important for locating\n294"

Some people with\nthese manifestations present with pain, others demonstrate the same age-related\nchanges but have no pain, and still others exhibit little morphological change\nbut complain of the same types of pain as those with evident change. In view of\nthis and the typical occurrence of these findings, some clinicians have suggested\nthat such age-related changes should not be considered pathological but as the\nnormal anatomy of aging (Bogduk, 2012).\n Anomalies of Vertebrae\nSometimes the epiphysis of a transverse process fails to fuse. Therefore, caution\nmust be exercised so that a persistent epiphysis is not mistaken for a vertebral\nfracture in a radiograph or computed tomographic (CT) scan.\nA common birth defect of the vertebral column is spina bifida occulta, in\nwhich the neural arches of L5 and/or S1 fail to develop normally and fuse\nposterior to the vertebral canal. This bony defect, present in up to 24% of the\npopulation (Greer, 2009), usually occurs in the vertebral arch of L5 and/or S1.\nIn a minor form of spina bifida, the only evidence of its presence may be a\nsmall dimple with a tuft of hair arising from the lower back. The defect is\nconcealed by the overlying skin. Most infants with this minor type of spina\nbifida have back problems (Moore et al., 2016). When examining a neonate,\nadjacent vertebrae should be palpated in sequence to be certain the vertebral\narches are intact and continuous from the cervical to the sacral regions.\nIn severe types of spina bifida, spina bifida cystica, one or more vertebral\narches may fail to develop completely. Spina bifida cystica is associated with\nherniation of the meninges (meningocele, a spina bifida associated with a\nmeningeal cyst) and/or the spinal cord (meningomyelocele) (Fig. B2.10).\nNeurological symptoms are usually present in severe cases of\nmeningomyelocele (e.g., paralysis of the limbs and disturbances in bladder and\nbowel control).

The thin interspinous ligaments connect adjoining spinous processes,\nattaching from the root to the apex of each process. The cord-like band forming\nthe supraspinous ligaments connects the tips of the spinous processes from C7\nto the sacrum and merge superiorly with the nuchal ligament at the back of the\nneck (Fr. nuque, back of the neck) (Fig. 2.18A). Unlike the interspinous and\nsupraspinous ligaments, the strong, broad nuchal ligament (L. ligamentum\nnuchae) is composed of thickened fibroelastic tissue. It extends as a median band\nfrom the external occipital protuberance and posterior border of the foramen\nmagnum to the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae. Because of the\nshortness and depth of the C3\u2013C5 spinous processes, the nuchal ligament\nprovides attachment for muscles that attach to the spinous processes of vertebrae\nat other levels. The intertransverse ligaments, connecting adjacent transverse\nprocesses, consist of scattered fibers in the cervical region and fibrous cords in\nthe thoracic region (Fig. 2.18B). In the lumbar region, these ligaments are thin\nand membranous.\nCRANIOVERTEBRAL JOINTS\nThere are two sets of craniovertebral joints, the atlanto-occipital joints, formed\nbetween the atlas (C1 vertebra) and the occipital bone of the cranium, and the\natlanto-axial joints, formed between the atlas and axis (C2 vertebra) (Fig. 2.20).\n311"

Not only do\nthey become increasing convex but also, between the ages of 20 and 70, their\nanteroposterior (AP) diameter increases about 10% in females and 2% in males.\nThe thickness (height) increases centrally about 10% in both sexes. Overt or\nmarked disc narrowing, especially when it is greater than that of more\nsuperiorly located discs, suggests pathology (degenerative disc disease), not\nnormal aging (Bogduk, 2012).\nBack Pain\nBack pain in general, and lower back pain (LBP) in particular, is an immense\nhealth problem, second only to the common cold as a reason people visit their\ndoctors. In terms of health factors causing lost work days, backache is second\nonly to headache. The anatomical bases for the pain, especially the nerves\ninitially involved in sensing and carrying pain from the vertebral column itself,\nare rarely described.\nFive categories of structures receive innervation in the back and can be\nsources of pain:\nFibroskeletal structures: periosteum, ligaments, and anuli fibrosi of IV discs.\nMeninges: coverings of the spinal cord.\nSynovial joints: capsules of the zygapophysial joints.\nMuscles: intrinsic muscles of the back.\nNervous tissue: spinal nerves or nerve roots exiting the IV foramina.\n328"

Muscular pain is usually related\nto reflexive cramping (spasms) producing ischemia, often secondarily as a result\nof guarding (contraction of muscles in anticipation of pain). Zygapophysial\njoint pain is generally associated with aging (osteoarthritis) or disease\n(rheumatoid arthritis) of the joints. Pain from vertebral fractures and\ndislocations is no different than that from other bones and joints: the sharp pain\nfollowing a fracture is mostly periosteal (membrane covering the bone) in\norigin, whereas pain from dislocations is ligamentous (relating to the structure\nof the ligament). The acute localized pain associated with an IV disc herniation\nundoubtedly emanates from the disrupted posterolateral anulus fibrosis and\nimpingement on the posterior longitudinal ligament. Pain in all of these latter\ninstances is conveyed initially by the meningeal branches of the spinal nerves.\n Herniation of Nucleus Pulposus\n(Herniation of IV Disc)\nHerniation (protrusion) of the gelatinous nucleus pulposus into or through the\nanulus fibrosus is a well-recognized cause of lower back pain (LBP) and lower\nlimb pain (Fig. B2.11A, C).

The localized back pain\nof a herniated disc, which is usually acute pain, results from pressure on the\nlongitudinal ligaments and periphery of the anulus fibrosus and from local\ninflammation caused by chemical irritation by substances from the ruptured\nnucleus pulposus. Chronic pain resulting from compression of the spinal nerve\nroots by the herniated disc is usually referred radiating pain, perceived as\ncoming from the area (dermatome) supplied by that nerve. Because the IV discs\nare largest in the lumbar and lumbosacral regions, where movements are\nconsequently greater, posterolateral herniations of the nucleus pulposus are\nmost common here (Fig. B2.11B).\nApproximately 95% of lumbar disc protrusions occur at the L4\u2013L5 or L5\u2013\nS1 levels. The marked decrease in the radiographic intervertebral space (i.e., in\ndisc height) that may occur as a result of acute herniation of a nucleus pulposus\nmay also result in narrowing of the IV foramina, perhaps exacerbating the\ncompression of the spinal nerve roots, especially if hypertrophy of the\nsurrounding bone has also occurred. Because the nucleus becomes increasingly\ndehydrated and fibrous, or even granular or solid with aging, a diagnosis of\nacute herniation in advanced years is regarded with suspicion. It is more likely\nthat the nerve roots are being compressed by increased ossification of the IV\nforamen as they exit.\nAcute middle and low back pain may be caused by a mild posterolateral\nprotrusion of a lumbar IV disc at the L5\u2013S1 level that affects nociceptive (pain)\nendings in the region, such as those associated with the posterior longitudinal\nligament. The clinical picture varies considerably, but pain of acute onset in the\nlower back is a common presenting symptom. Because muscle spasm is\nassociated with low back pain, the lumbar region of the vertebral column\nbecomes tense and increasingly cramped as relative ischemia (local loss of\nblood supply) occurs, causing painful movement.\nSciatica, pain radiating from the lower back into the buttock and down the\nposterior or lateral aspect of the thigh into the leg, is often caused by a herniated\nlumbar IV disc that compresses and compromises the L5 or S1 component of\nthe sciatic nerve (Fig. B2.11C).

The general rule is that when an\nIV disc protrudes, it usually compresses the nerve root numbered one inferior to\nthe herniated disc; for example, the L5 nerve is compressed by an L4\u2013L5 IV\ndisc herniation. In the thoracic and lumbar regions, the IV disc forms the\ninferior half of the anterior border of the IV foramen and that the superior half is\nformed by the bone of the body of the superior vertebra (see Fig. 2.14).\nThe spinal nerve roots descend to the IV foramen from which the spinal\nnerve formed by their merging will exit. The nerve that exits a given IV\nforamen passes through the superior bony half of the foramen and thus lies\nabove and is not affected by a herniating disc at that level. However, the nerve\nroots passing to the IV foramen immediately and farther below pass directly\nacross the area of herniation.

Dowager hump is a colloquial name for excessive\nthoracic kyphosis in older women resulting from osteoporosis. However, this\ntype of kyphosis also occurs in elderly men (Swartz, 2009).\nOsteoporosis especially affects the horizontal trabeculae of the trabecular\nbone of the vertebral body (see Fig. 2.3). The remaining, unsupported vertical\ntrabeculae are less able to resist compression and sustain compression fractures,\nresulting in short and wedge-shaped thoracic vertebrae (see Fig. B2.9A).\nProgressive erosion and collapse of vertebrae also result in an overall loss of\nheight. The excessive kyphosis leads to an increase in the AP diameter of the\nthorax and a significant reduction in dynamic pulmonary capacity.\nExcessive lumbar lordosis (clinically shortened to lordosis, although once\nagain this term actually describes the normal curvature; colloquially, excessive\nlumbar lordosis is known as hollow back or sway back) is characterized by an\nanterior tilting of the pelvis (the upper sacrum is flexed or rotated antero-\ninferiorly\u2014nutation), with increased extension of the lumbar vertebrae,\nproducing an abnormal increase in the lumbar kyphosis (Fig. B2.18C).\nThis abnormal extension deformity is often associated with weakened trunk\nmusculature, especially the anterolateral abdominal muscles. To compensate for\nalterations to their normal line of gravity, women develop a temporary\nexcessive lumbar lordosis during late pregnancy. This lordotic curvature may\ncause lower back pain, but the discomfort normally disappears soon after\nchildbirth.\nObesity in both sexes can also cause excessive lumbar lordosis and lower\nback pain because of the increased weight of the abdominal contents (e.g.,\n\u201cpotbelly\u201d) anterior to the normal line of gravity. Loss of weight and exercise of\nthe anterolateral abdominal muscles facilitate correction of this type of\nexcessive lordosis.\nScoliosis (G., crookedness or curved back) is characterized by an abnormal\nlateral curvature that is accompanied by rotation of the vertebrae (Fig. B2.18D,\nE, and G).

These\nmuscles, which extend from the pelvis to the cranium, are enclosed by deep\nfascia that attaches medially to the nuchal ligament (Fig. 2.30), the tips of the\nspinous processes of the vertebrae, the supraspinous ligament, and the median\ncrest of the sacrum. The fascia attaches laterally to the cervical and lumbar\ntransverse processes and the angles of the ribs. The thoracic and lumbar parts of\nthe deep fascia constitute the thoracolumbar fascia (Fig. 4.28).

However, bear in mind that in\nthese as in all movements, the eccentric contraction (controlled relaxation) of the\nantagonist muscles is vital to smooth, controlled movement (see \u201cMuscle Tissue\nand the Muscular System\u201d in Chapter 1, Overview and Basic Concepts). Thus, it\nis actually the interaction of anterior (abdominal) and posterior (back) muscles\n(as well as the contralateral pairs of each) that provides the stability and\nproduces motion of the axial skeleton, much like guy (guide) wires support a\npole. Often chronic back strain (such as that caused by excessive lumbar\nlordosis; see B2.18C) results from imbalance in this support (lack of tonus of\nabdominal muscles in the case of lordosis). Exercise or elimination of excessive,\nunevenly distributed weight may be required to restore balance.\nSmaller muscles generally have higher densities of muscle spindles (sensors\nof proprioception that are interdigitated among the muscle\u2019s fibers) than do large\nmuscles.

It results from\nexcessively strong contractions related to movements of the vertebral column,\nsuch as excessive extension or rotation.\nBack strain is a common injury in people who participate in sports; it results\nfrom overly strong muscular contraction. The strain involves some degree of\nstretching or microscopic tearing of muscle fibers. The muscles usually\ninvolved are those producing movements of the lumbar IV joints, especially the\nerector spinae. If the weight is not properly balanced on the vertebral column,\nstrain is exerted on the muscles.\nUsing the back as a lever when lifting puts an enormous strain on the\nvertebral column and its ligaments and muscles. Strains can be minimized if the\nlifter crouches, holds the back as straight as possible, and uses the muscles of\nthe buttocks (nates) and lower limbs to assist with the lifting.\nAs a protective mechanism, the back muscles go into spasm after an injury\nor in response to inflammation (e.g., of ligaments). A spasm is a sudden\ninvoluntary contraction of one or more muscle groups. Spasms are attended by\ncramps, pain, and interference with function, producing involuntary movement\nand distortion.\n Reduced Blood Supply to the Brainstem\nThe winding course of the vertebral arteries through the foramina transversarii\nof the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and through the\nsuboccipital triangles becomes clinically significant when blood flow through\nthese arteries is reduced, as occurs with arteriosclerosis (hardening of arteries).\n367"

            "Text": "The anterior spinal artery, formed by the union of branches of the vertebral\narteries, runs inferiorly in the anterior median fissure. Sulcal arteries arise from\nthe anterior spinal artery and enter the spinal cord through this fissure (Fig.\n2.48B). The sulcal arteries supply approximately two thirds of the cross-sectional\narea of the spinal cord (Standring, 2016).\nEach posterior spinal artery is a branch of either the vertebral artery or the\nposteroinferior cerebellar artery (Figs. 2.47B and 2.48). The posterior spinal\narteries commonly form anastomosing channels in the pia mater.\nBy themselves, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries can supply only the\nshort superior part of the spinal cord. The circulation to much of the spinal cord\ndepends on segmental medullary and radicular arteries running along the spinal\nnerve roots. The anterior and posterior segmental medullary arteries are\nderived from spinal branches of the ascending cervical, deep cervical, vertebral,\nposterior intercostal, and lumbar arteries. The segmental medullary arteries occur\nmainly in association with the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements, regions\nwhere the need for a good blood supply is greatest. They enter the vertebral\ncanal through the IV foramina.\nThe great anterior segmental medullary artery (of Adamkiewicz), which\nis on the left side in about 65% of people, reinforces the circulation to two thirds\nof the spinal cord, including the lumbosacral enlargement (Figs. 2.39 and\n2.47A). The great artery, much larger than the other segmental medullary\narteries, usually arises via a spinal branch from an inferior intercostal or upper\nlumbar artery and enters the vertebral canal through the IV foramen at the lower\nthoracic or upper lumbar level.\nThe posterior and anterior roots of the spinal nerves and their coverings are\nsupplied by posterior and anterior radicular arteries (L. radix, root), which\nrun along the nerve roots (Figs. 2.47 and 2.48). The radicular arteries do not\nreach the posterior, anterior, or spinal arteries. Segmental medullary arteries\nreplace the radicular arteries at the irregular levels at which they occur. Most\nradicular arteries are small and supply only the nerve roots; however, some of\nthem may assist with the supply of superficial parts of the gray matter in the\nposterior and anterior horns of the spinal cord.\nVEINS OF SPINAL CORD\nIn general, the veins of the spinal cord have a distribution similar to that of the\nspinal arteries. There are usually three anterior and three posterior spinal veins\n384"

            "Text": "(Fig. 2.48A). The spinal veins are arranged longitudinally, communicate freely\nwith each other, and are drained by up to 12 anterior and posterior medullary\nand radicular veins. The veins of the spinal cord join the internal vertebral\n(epidural) venous plexuses in the epidural space (see Fig. 2.27). The internal\nvertebral venous plexuses pass superiorly through the foramen magnum to\ncommunicate with dural sinuses and vertebral veins in the cranium. The internal\nvertebral plexuses also communicate with the external vertebral venous plexuses\non the external surface of the vertebrae.\nCLINICAL BOX\nCONTENTS OF VERTEBRAL CANAL\n Compression of Lumbar Spinal Nerve\nRoots\nThe lumbar spinal nerves increase in size from superior to inferior, whereas the\nIV foramina decrease in diameter. Consequently, the L5 spinal nerve roots are\nthe thickest and their foramina, the narrowest. This increases the chance that\nthese nerve roots will be compressed if osteophytes (bony spurs) develop (see\nFig. B2.9B), or herniation of an IV disc occurs.\n Myelography\nMyelography is a radiopaque contrast procedure that allows visualization of the\nspinal cord and spinal nerve roots (see Fig. 2.44B). In this procedure, CSF is\nwithdrawn by lumbar puncture and replaced with a contrast material injected\ninto the spinal subarachnoid space. This technique shows the extent of the\nsubarachnoid space and its extensions around the spinal nerve roots within the\ndural root sheaths. High-resolution MRI has largely supplanted myelography.\n385"

They develop as a single layer from the mesenchyme surrounding\nthe embryonic spinal cord. Fluid-filled spaces form within this layer and\ncoalesce to produce the subarachnoid space (Moore et al., 2016). The origin of\nboth pia and arachnoid from a single membrane is reflected by the numerous\narachnoid trabeculae passing between them (Fig. 2.43). In adults, the arachnoid\nis thick enough to be manipulated with forceps. The delicate pia mater gives a\nshiny appearance to the surface of the spinal cord but is barely visible to the\nunaided eye as a distinct layer.\n Lumbar Spinal Puncture\nLumbar puncture (LP, spinal tap), the withdrawal of CSF from the lumbar\ncistern, is an important diagnostic tool for evaluating a variety of central\nnervous system (CNS) disorders. Meningitis and diseases of the CNS may alter\nthe cells in the CSF or change the concentration of its chemical constituents.\nExamination of CSF can also determine if blood is present.\nLP is performed with the patient lying on the side with the back and hips\nflexed (knee\u2013chest position, Fig. B2.19). Flexion of the vertebral column\nfacilitates insertion of the needle by spreading apart the vertebral laminae and\nspinous processes, stretching the ligamenta flava.\n386"

The spinal cord may also suffer\ncirculatory impairment if the segmental medullary arteries, particularly the great\nanterior segmental medullary artery (of Adamkiewicz), are narrowed by\nobstructive arterial disease.\nSometimes the aorta is purposely occluded (cross clamped) during surgery.\nPatients undergoing such surgeries, and those with ruptured aneurysms of the\naorta or occlusion of the great anterior segmental medullary artery, may lose all\nsensation and voluntary movement inferior to the level of impaired blood\nsupply to the spinal cord (paraplegia) secondary to death of neurons in the part\nof the spinal cord supplied by the anterior spinal artery (Figs. 2.47 and 2.48).\nNeurons with cell bodies distant from the site of ischemia of the spinal cord\nwill also die, secondary to the degeneration of axons traversing the site.

For exact description, the\nupper limb is divided into regions based on the external features\n(surface anatomy) of the underlying muscular formations, bones,\nand joints.\n1. Shoulder: proximal segment of the limb that overlaps parts of the trunk\n(thorax and back) and lower lateral neck. It includes the pectoral, scapular,\nand deltoid regions of the upper limb, and the lateral part (greater\nsupraclavicular fossa) of the lateral cervical region. It overlies half of the\npectoral girdle. The pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle) is a bony ring,\nincomplete posteriorly, formed by the scapulae and clavicles, and completed\nanteriorly by the manubrium of the sternum (part of the axial skeleton).\n2. Arm (L. brachium): first segment of the free upper limb (more mobile part of\nthe upper limb independent of the trunk) and the longest segment of the limb.\nIt extends between and connects the shoulder and the elbow, and consists of\nanterior and posterior regions of the arm, centered around the humerus.\n3. Forearm (L. antebrachium): second longest segment of the limb.

However, they are sufficiently distinct in structure to enable markedly\ndifferent functions and abilities. Because the upper limb is not usually involved\nin weight bearing or motility, its stability has been sacrificed to gain mobility.\nThe upper limb still possesses remarkable strength, and because of the hand\u2019s\nability to conform to a paddle or assume a gripping or platform configuration, it\nmay assume a role in motility in certain circumstances.\n399"

            "Text": "Both the upper and the lower limbs are connected to the axial skeleton\n(cranium, vertebral column, and associated thoracic cage) via the bony pectoral\nand pelvic girdles, respectively. The pelvic girdle consists of the two hip bones\nconnected to the sacrum (see Figure 7.3). The pectoral girdle consists of the\nscapulae and clavicles, connected to the manubrium of the sternum. Both girdles\npossess a large flat bone located posteriorly, which provides for attachment of\nproximal muscles and which connects with its contralateral partner anteriorly via\nsmall bony braces, the pubic rami and clavicles. However, the flat iliac bones of\nthe pelvic girdle are also connected posteriorly through their primary attachment\nto the sacrum via the essentially rigid, weight-transferring sacro-iliac joints. This\nposterior connection to the axial skeleton places the lower limbs inferior to the\ntrunk, enabling them to be supportive as they function primarily in relation to the\nline of gravity. Furthermore, because the two sides are connected both anteriorly\nand posteriorly, the pelvic girdle forms a complete rigid ring that limits mobility,\nmaking the movements of one limb markedly affect the movements of the other.\nThe pectoral girdle, however, is connected to the trunk only anteriorly, via the\nsternum, by flexible joints with 3 degrees of freedom. It is an incomplete ring\nbecause the scapulae are not connected with each other posteriorly. Thus, the\nmotion of one upper limb is independent of the other, and the limbs are able to\noperate effectively anterior to the body, at a distance and level that enable\nprecise eye\u2013hand coordination.\nIn both the upper and the lower limbs, the long bone of the most proximal\nsegment is the largest and is unpaired. The long bones increase progressively in\nnumber but decrease in size in the more distal segments of the limb. The second\nmost proximal segment of both limbs (i.e., the leg and forearm) has two parallel\nbones, although only in the forearm do both articulate with the bone of the\nproximal segment, and only in the leg do both articulate directly with the distal\nsegment. Although the paired bones of both the leg and forearm flex and extend\nas a unit, only those of the upper limb are able to move (supinate and pronate)\nrelative to each other; the bones of the leg are fixed in the pronated position.\nThe wrist and ankle have a similar number of short bones (eight and seven,\nrespectively). Both groups of short bones interrupt a series of long bones that\nresumes distally with several sets of long bones of similar lengths, with a similar\nnumber of joints of essentially the same type. The digits of the upper limb\n(fingers including thumb) are the most mobile parts of either limb. However, all\nother parts of the upper limb are more mobile than are the comparable parts of\nthe lower limb.\n400"

The\nglenohumeral (shoulder) joint on which these muscles operate is almost directly\ninferior to the AC joint; thus, the scapular mass is balanced with that of the free\nlimb, and the suspending structure (coracoclavicular ligament) lies between the\ntwo masses.\nSuperolaterally, the lateral surface of the scapula has a glenoid cavity (G.\nsocket), which receives and articulates with the head of the humerus at the\nglenohumeral joint (Fig. 3.5A, C). The glenoid cavity is a shallow, concave, oval\nfossa (L. fossa ovalis), directed anterolaterally and slightly superiorly\u2014that is\nconsiderably smaller than the ball (head of the humerus) for which it serves as a\nsocket. The beak-like coracoid process (G. korak-od\u00e9s, like a crow\u2019s beak) is\nsuperior to the glenoid cavity, and projects anterolaterally. This process also\nresembles in size, shape, and direction a bent finger pointing to the shoulder, the\nknuckle of which provides the inferior attachment for the passively supporting\ncoracoclavicular ligament.\nThe scapula has medial, lateral, and superior borders and superior, lateral,\nand inferior angles (Fig. 3.5B). When the scapular body is in the anatomical\nposition, the thin medial border of the scapula runs parallel to and\napproximately 5 cm lateral to the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae;\nhence it is often called the vertebral border (Fig. 3.5B). From the inferior angle,\nthe lateral border of the scapula runs superolaterally toward the apex of the\naxilla; hence it is often called the axillary border. The lateral border is composed\nof a thick bar of bone that prevents buckling of this stress-bearing region of the\nscapula.\nThe lateral border terminates in the truncated lateral angle of the scapula,\nthe thickest part of the bone that bears the broadened head of the scapula (Fig.\n3.5A, B). The glenoid cavity is the primary feature of the head. The shallow\nconstriction between the head and body defines the neck of the scapula. The\nsuperior border of the scapula is marked near the junction of its medial two\nthirds and lateral third by the suprascapular notch, which is located where the\nsuperior border joins the base of the coracoid process. The superior border is the\nthinnest and shortest of the three borders.\nThe scapula is capable of considerable movement on the thoracic wall at the\nphysiological scapulothoracic joint, providing the base from which the upper\nlimb operates. These movements, enabling the arm to move freely, are discussed\nlater in this chapter with the muscles that move the scapula.\n406"

The proximal end of the humerus has a head, surgical\nand anatomical necks, and greater and lesser tubercles. The spherical head of the\nhumerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The anatomical\nneck of the humerus is formed by the groove circumscribing the head and\nseparating it from the greater and lesser tubercles. It indicates the line of\nattachment of the glenohumeral joint capsule. The surgical neck of the\nhumerus, a common site of fracture, is the narrow part distal to the head and\ntubercles (Fig. 3.3B).\nThe junction of the head and neck with the shaft of the humerus is indicated\nby the greater and lesser tubercles, which provide attachment and leverage to\nsome scapulohumeral muscles (Fig. 3.3A, B). The greater tubercle is at the\nlateral margin of the humerus, whereas the lesser tubercle projects anteriorly\nfrom the bone. The intertubercular sulcus (bicipital groove) separates the\ntubercles and provides protected passage for the slender tendon of the long head\nof the biceps muscle.\nThe shaft of the humerus has two prominent features: the deltoid\ntuberosity laterally, for attachment of the deltoid muscle, and the oblique radial\ngroove (groove for the radial nerve, spiral groove) posteriorly. The radial\nnerve and profunda brachii artery lie in the groove as they pass anterior to the\nlong head and between the medial and the lateral heads of the triceps brachii\nmuscle.

For\nclinical studies, the radiographs are compared with a series of standards in a\nradiographic atlas of skeletal development to determine skeletal age. Ossification\ncenters are usually obvious during the 1st year; however, they may appear before\nbirth. Each carpal bone usually ossifies from one center postnatally (Fig. 3.9D).\nThe centers for the capitate and hamate appear first.\nThe shaft of each metacarpal begins to ossify during fetal life. Ossification\ncenters appear postnatally in the heads of the four medial metacarpals and in the\nbase of the 1st metacarpal. By age 11, ossification centers of all carpal bones are\nvisible (Fig. 3.9E).\nSurface Anatomy of Upper Limb Bones\nMost bones of the upper limb offer a palpable segment or surface (notable\nexceptions being the lunate and trapezoid), enabling the skilled examiner to\ndiscern abnormalities owing to trauma (fracture or dislocation) or malformation\n(Fig. 3.10).\nThe clavicle is subcutaneous and can be easily palpated throughout its\nlength. Its sternal end projects superior to the manubrium of the sternum (Fig.\n3.10). Between the elevated sternal ends of the clavicles is the jugular notch\n(suprasternal notch). The acromial end of the clavicle often rises higher than the\nacromion, forming a palpable elevation at the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The\nacromial end can be palpated 2\u20133 cm medial to the lateral border of the\nacromion, particularly when the arm is alternately flexed and extended. Either or\nboth ends of the clavicle may be prominent; when present, this condition is\nusually bilateral.\nNote the elasticity of the skin over the clavicle and how easily it can be\npinched into a mobile fold. This property of the skin is useful when ligating\n(tying a knot around) the third part of the subclavian artery: The skin lying\nsuperior to the clavicle is pulled down onto the clavicle and then incised. After\nthe incision is made, the skin is allowed to return to its position superior to the\nclavicle, where it overlies the artery (thus, it is not endangered during the\nincision).\n416"

A very small\nepiphysis may be present at the acromial end of the clavicle; it must not be\nmistaken for a fracture.\nSometimes fusion of the two ossification centers of the clavicle fails to\noccur; as a result, a bony defect forms between the lateral and medial thirds of\nthe clavicle.

If the structure is\nvital (necessary for life), the fetus will not survive birth. Failure of a nonvital\npart usually allows survival with limitations that may range from slight to\nsevere. Surgical reconstruction may enable normal or near normal function and\nappearance to be established.\nHistorically, agenesis of a specific structure contributed to the\nunderstanding of the function of that structure and yielded insight about the\nbody\u2019s ability to compensate and adapt, as well as the structure\u2019s normal role in\ninfluencing the development of other regional or systemic structures. The\nabsence of a muscle, for example, not only affects body form, but reveals the\nrole that muscle usually plays in terms of movement and resting position,\ninfluencing the growth of the bones to which it is normally attached, as well as\nthe role of opposing muscles and the potential for synergistic muscles to\ncompensate. The result of muscular agenesis predicts the effects of muscular\nparalysis or surgical removal: inability to perform particular movements due to\nthe absence of phasic contraction, and positioning at rest determined by the\ntonic contraction of the antagonists.\nPoland syndrome is an uncommon but not rare unilateral congenital\nanomaly of upper limb development, lowest level of which is agenesis of the\npectoralis major (especially its sternocostal part) and pectoralis minor (Fig.\nB3.5).

When the arm is fully abducted, the axillary vein overlaps the\naxillary artery anteriorly. A surgical or traumatic wound in the proximal part of\nthe axillary vein is particularly dangerous, not only because of profuse bleeding\nbut also because of the risk of air entering it and producing air emboli (air\nbubbles) in the blood.\n The Axillary Vein in Subclavian Vein\nPuncture\nSubclavian vein puncture, in which a catheter is placed into the subclavian vein,\nhas become a common clinical procedure (see clinical box \u201cSubclavian Vein\nPuncture\u201d in Chapter 9).\nThe axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein as the first rib is crossed (see\nFig. 3.45).

Because the axillary lymph nodes are arranged and receive lymph (and\ntherefore metastatic breast cancer cells) in a specific order, removing and\nexamining the lymph nodes in that order is important in determining the degree\nto which the cancer has developed and is likely to have metastasized.\nLymphatic drainage of the upper limb may be impeded after removal or\nradiation of the axillary nodes, resulting in lymphedema, swelling as a result of\naccumulated lymph, especially in the subcutaneous tissue.\nDuring axillary node dissection, two nerves are at risk of injury.

Because each peripheral nerve is a collection of nerve fibers\nbound together by connective tissue, it is understandable that the median nerve,\nfor instance, may have two medial roots instead of one (i.e., the nerve fibers are\nsimply grouped differently).

Upper brachial plexus injuries can\nalso occur in a neonate when excessive stretching of the neck occurs during\ndelivery (Fig. B3.13C).\nAs a result of injuries to the superior parts of the brachial plexus (Erb-\nDuchenne palsy), paralysis of the muscles of the shoulder and arm supplied by\nthe C5 and C6 spinal nerves occurs: deltoid, biceps, and brachialis. The usual\nclinical appearance is an upper limb with an adducted shoulder, medially\nrotated arm, and extended elbow. The lateral aspect of the forearm also\nexperiences some loss of sensation. Chronic microtrauma to the superior trunk\nof the brachial plexus from carrying a heavy backpack can produce motor and\nsensory deficits in the distribution of the musculocutaneous and radial nerves. A\nsuperior brachial plexus injury may produce muscle spasms and severe\ndisability in hikers (backpacker\u2019s palsy) who carry heavy backpacks for long\nperiods.\nAcute brachial plexus neuritis (brachial plexus neuropathy) is a neurologic\ndisorder of unknown cause that is characterized by the sudden onset of severe\npain, usually around the shoulder.

Numbers in boldface (C6) indicate the main segmental innervation.\nDamage to one or more of the listed spinal cord segments or to the motor nerve roots\narising from them results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.\nb Some of the lateral part of the brachialis is innervated by a branch of the radial nerve.\nThe arm muscles and their attachments are illustrated in Figure 3.49, and their\nattachments, innervation, and actions are described in Table 3.9.\nBICEPS BRACHII\nAs the term biceps brachii indicates, the proximal attachment of this fusiform\nmuscle usually has two heads (bi, two + L. caput, head). The two heads of the\nbiceps arise proximally by tendinous attachments to processes of the scapula,\ntheir fleshy bellies uniting just distal to the middle of the arm (Fig. 3.49B).\nApproximately 10% of people have a third head to the biceps. When present,\nthe third head extends from the superomedial part of the brachialis (with which it\nis blended), usually lying posterior to the brachial artery. In either case, a single\nbiceps tendon forms distally and attaches primarily to the radius.\nAlthough the biceps is located in the anterior compartment of the arm, it has\nno attachment to the humerus (Figs. 3.47B, C and 3.49A, B). The biceps is a\n\u201cthree-joint muscle,\u201d crossing and capable of effecting movement at the\nglenohumeral, elbow, and radio-ulnar joints, although it primarily acts at the\nlatter two. Its action and effectiveness are markedly affected by the position of\nthe elbow and forearm. When the elbow is extended, the biceps is a simple flexor\nof the forearm; however, as elbow flexion approaches 90\u00b0 and more power is\nneeded against resistance, the biceps is capable of two powerful movements,\ndepending on the position of the forearm. When the elbow is flexed close to 90\u00b0\nand the forearm is supinated, the biceps is most efficient in producing flexion.\nAlternately, when the forearm is pronated, the biceps is the primary (most\n528"

For example, it is used when right-handed\npeople drive a screw into hard wood, and when inserting a corkscrew and pulling\nthe cork from a wine bottle. The biceps barely operates as a flexor when the\nforearm is pronated, even against resistance. In the semiprone position, it is\nactive only against resistance (Hamill and Knutzen, 2014).\nArising from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and crossing the head\nof the humerus within the cavity of the glenohumeral joint, the rounded tendon\nof the long head of the biceps continues to be surrounded by synovial membrane\nas it descends in the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus. A broad band, the\ntransverse humeral ligament, passes from the lesser to the greater tubercle of\nthe humerus and converts the intertubercular groove into a canal (Fig. 3.49B).\nThe ligament holds the tendon of the long head of the biceps in the groove.\nDistally, the major attachment of the biceps is to the radial tuberosity via the\nbiceps tendon. However, a triangular membranous band, the bicipital\naponeurosis, runs from the biceps tendon across the cubital fossa and merges\nwith the antebrachial (deep) fascia covering the flexor muscles in the medial side\nof the forearm. It attaches indirectly by means of the fascia to the subcutaneous\nborder of the ulna. The proximal part of the aponeurosis can be easily felt where\nit passes obliquely over the brachial artery and median nerve (Figs. 3.47A and\n3.52A). The aponeurosis affords protection for these and other structures in the\ncubital fossa. It also helps lessen the pressure of the biceps tendon on the radial\ntuberosity during pronation and supination of the forearm.\nTo test the biceps brachii, the elbow joint is flexed against resistance when\nthe forearm is supinated. If acting normally, the muscle forms a prominent bulge\non the anterior aspect of the arm that is easily palpated.\nBRACHIALIS\nThe brachialis is a flattened fusiform muscle that lies posterior (deep) to the\nbiceps. Its distal attachment covers the anterior part of the elbow joint (Figs.\n3.47, 3.48, and 3.49D; Table 3.9). The brachialis is the main flexor of the\nforearm. It is the only pure flexor, producing the greatest amount of flexion\nforce. Unlike the biceps, the brachialis flexes the forearm in all positions, being\nunaffected by pronation or supination. It acts during both slow and quick\nmovements and in the presence or absence of resistance. When the forearm is\nextended slowly, the brachialis steadies the movement by slowly relaxing, that\nis, eccentric contraction (e.g., you use it to pick up and put down a teacup\n529"

If acting normally, the contracted muscle can be seen and palpated.\nCORACOBRACHIALIS\nThe coracobrachialis is an elongated muscle in the superomedial part of the\narm. It is a useful landmark for locating other structures in the arm (Figs. 3.47,\n3.48, and 3.49C; Table 3.9). For example, the musculocutaneous nerve pierces it,\nand the distal part of its attachment indicates the location of the nutrient foramen\nof the humerus. The coracobrachialis helps flex and adduct the arm and stabilize\nthe glenohumeral joint. With the deltoid and long head of the triceps, it serves as\na shunt muscle, resisting downward dislocation of the head of the humerus, as\nwhen carrying a heavy suitcase. The median nerve and/or the brachial artery may\nrun deep to the coracobrachialis and be compressed by it.\nTRICEPS BRACHII\nThe triceps brachii is a large fusiform muscle in the posterior compartment of\nthe arm (Figs. 3.47, 3.48, 3.49F, and 3.50; Table 3.9).

Not uncommonly, the deep veins join to\nform one brachial vein during part of their course.\nNerves of Arm\nFour main nerves pass through the arm: median, ulnar, musculocutaneous, and\nradial (Fig. 3.53). Their origins from the brachial plexus, courses in the upper\nlimb, and the structures innervated by them are summarized in Table 3.8. The\nmedian and ulnar nerves do not supply branches to the arm.\nMUSCULOCUTANEOUS NERVE\nThe musculocutaneous nerve begins opposite the inferior border of the\npectoralis minor, pierces the coracobrachialis, and continues distally between the\nbiceps and brachialis (Fig. 3.52B). After supplying all three muscles of the\nanterior compartment of the arm, the musculocutaneous nerve emerges lateral to\nthe biceps as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (Fig. 3.53). It becomes\ntruly subcutaneous when it pierces the deep fascia proximal to the cubital fossa\nto course initially with the cephalic vein in the subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 3.52A).\nAfter crossing the anterior aspect of the elbow, it continues to supply the skin of\nthe lateral aspect of the forearm.\nRADIAL NERVE\nThe radial nerve in the arm supplies all the muscles in the posterior\ncompartment of the arm (and forearm). The radial nerve enters the arm posterior\nto the brachial artery, medial to the humerus, and anterior to the long head of the\ntriceps, where it gives branches to the long and medial heads of the triceps (Fig.\n3.48). The radial nerve then descends inferolaterally with the profunda brachii\nartery and passes around the humeral shaft in the radial groove (Figs. 3.47B,\n3.50, and 3.53). The branch of the radial nerve to the lateral head of the triceps\narises within the radial groove.

Therefore, the brachioradialis is a major exception to the rule that\n(1) the radial nerve supplies only extensor muscles and (2) that all flexors lie in\nthe anterior (flexor) compartment.\nThe long flexors of the digits (flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor\ndigitorum profundus) also flex the metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints. The\nflexor digitorum profundus flexes the digits in slow action. This action is\nreinforced by the flexor digitorum superficialis when speed and flexion against\nresistance are required. When the wrist is flexed at the same time that the\nmetacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints are flexed, the long flexor\nmuscles of the fingers are operating over a shortened distance between\nattachments, and the action resulting from their contraction is consequently\nweaker. Extending the wrist increases their operating distance, and thus, their\ncontraction is more efficient in producing a strong grip (see Fig. 3.73A).\nTendons of the long flexors of the digits pass through the distal part of the\nforearm, wrist, and palm and continue to the medial four fingers. The flexor\ndigitorum superficialis flexes the middle phalanges, and the flexor digitorum\nprofundus flexes the middle and distal phalanges.\nThe muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm are illustrated in\nFigure 3.59 and their attachments, innervation, and main actions are listed by\nlayers in Table 3.10. The following discussion provides additional details,\nbeginning with the muscles of the superficial and intermediate layers.\nPronator Teres.\nThe pronator teres, a fusiform muscle, is the most lateral of the superficial\nforearm flexors. Its lateral border forms the medial boundary of the cubital fossa.\nTo test the pronator teres, the person\u2019s forearm is flexed at the elbow and\n553"

If\nacting normally, the muscle is prominent and can be palpated at the medial\nmargin of the cubital fossa.\nFlexor Carpi Radialis.\nThe flexor carpi radialis (FCR) is a long fusiform muscle located medial to the\npronator teres. In the middle of the forearm, its fleshy belly is replaced by a long,\nflattened tendon that becomes cord-like as it approaches the wrist. The FCR\nproduces flexion (when acting with the flexor carpi ulnaris) and abduction of the\nwrist (when acting with the extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis). When\nacting alone, the FCR produces a combination of flexion and abduction\nsimultaneously at the wrist so that the hand moves anterolaterally.\nTo reach its distal attachment, the FCR tendon passes through a canal in the\nlateral part of the flexor retinaculum and through a vertical groove in the\ntrapezium in its own synovial tendinous sheath of the flexor carpi radialis\n(Fig. 3.57C). The FCR tendon is a good guide to the radial artery, which lies just\nlateral to it (Fig. 3.56C).\nTo test the flexor carpi radialis, the person is asked to flex the wrist against\nresistance. If acting normally, its tendon can be easily seen and palpated.\nPalmaris Longus.\nThe palmaris longus, a small fusiform muscle, is absent on one or both sides\n(usually the left) in approximately 14% of people, but its actions are not missed.\nIt has a short belly and a long, cord-like tendon that passes superficial to the\nflexor retinaculum and attaches to it and the apex of the palmar aponeurosis\n(Figs. 3.56C and 3.58). The palmaris longus tendon is a useful guide to the\nmedian nerve at the wrist. The tendon lies deep and slightly medial to this nerve\nbefore it passes deep to the flexor retinaculum.\nTo test the palmaris longus, the wrist is flexed and the pads of the little\nfinger and thumb are tightly pinched together.

It flexes the wrist when it acts with the FCR and adducts it when\nacting with the extensor carpi ulnaris. The ulnar nerve enters the forearm by\npassing between the humeral and ulnar heads of its proximal attachment (Fig.\n3.56C). This muscle is exceptional among muscles of the anterior compartment,\nbeing fully innervated by the ulnar nerve. The tendon of the FCU is a guide to\nthe ulnar nerve and artery, which are on its lateral side at the wrist (Fig. 3.56C,\nE).\nTo test the flexor carpi ulnaris, the person puts the posterior aspect of the\nforearm and hand on a flat table and is then asked to flex the wrist against\nresistance while the examiner palpates the muscle and its tendon.\nFlexor Digitorum Superficialis.\nThe flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) is sometimes considered one of the\nsuperficial muscles of the forearm, which attach to the common flexor origin and\ntherefore cross the elbow (Table 3.10). When considered this way, it is the\nlargest superficial muscle in the forearm. However, the FDS actually forms an\nintermediate layer between the superficial and deep groups of forearm muscles\n(Figs. 3.56C and 3.57B). The median nerve and ulnar artery enter the forearm by\npassing between its humero-ulnar and radial heads (Fig. 3.59A, C). Near the\nwrist, the FDS gives rise to four tendons, which pass deep to the flexor\nretinaculum through the carpal tunnel to the fingers. The four tendons are\nenclosed (along with the four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus) in a\nsynovial common flexor sheath (Fig. 3.57C). The FDS flexes the middle\nphalanges of the medial four fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints. In\ncontinued action, the FDS also flexes the proximal phalanges at the\nmetacarpophalangeal joints and the wrist joint. The FDS is capable of flexing\neach finger it serves independently.\nTo test the flexor digitorum superficialis, one finger is flexed at the proximal\ninterphalangeal joint against resistance and the other three fingers are held in an\nextended position to inactivate the flexor digitorum profundus.\nThe fascial plane between the intermediate and deep layers of muscles\nmakes up the primary neurovascular plane of the anterior (flexor\u2013pronator)\ncompartment; the main neurovascular bundles exclusive to this compartment\ncourse within it.

This thick muscle\n\u201cclothes\u201d the anterior aspect of the ulna. The FDP flexes the distal phalanges of\nthe medial four fingers after the FDS has flexed their middle phalanges (i.e., it\ncurls the fingers and assists with flexion of the hand, making a fist). Each tendon\nis capable of flexing two interphalangeal joints, the metacarpophalangeal joint\nand the wrist joint. The FDP divides into four parts, which end in four tendons\nthat pass posterior to the FDS tendons and the flexor retinaculum within the\ncommon flexor sheath (Fig. 3.57C). The part of the muscle going to the index\nfinger usually separates from the rest of the muscle relatively early in the distal\npart of the forearm and is capable of independent contraction. Each tendon enters\nthe fibrous sheath of its digit, posterior to the FDS tendons. Unlike the FDS, the\nFDP can flex only the index finger independently; thus, the fingers can be\nindependently flexed at the proximal but not the distal interphalangeal joints.\nTo test the flexor digitorum profundus, the proximal interphalangeal joint is\nheld in the extended position while the person attempts to flex the distal\ninterphalangeal joint. The integrity of the median nerve in the proximal forearm\ncan be tested by performing this test using the index finger, and that of the ulnar\nnerve can be assessed by using the little finger.\nFlexor Pollicis Longus.\nThe flexor pollicis longus (FPL), the long flexor of the thumb (L. pollex,\nthumb), lies lateral to the FDP, where it clothes the anterior aspect of the radius\ndistal to the attachment of the supinator (Figs. 3.56C, E and 3.59A, D; Table\n3.10). The flat FPL tendon passes deep to the flexor retinaculum, enveloped in\nits own synovial tendinous sheath of the flexor pollicis longus on the lateral\nside of the common flexor sheath (Fig. 3.57C). The FPL primarily flexes the\ndistal phalanx of the thumb at the interphalangeal joint and, secondarily, the\nproximal phalanx and 1st metacarpal at the metacarpophalangeal and\ncarpometacarpal joints, respectively.

As mentioned previously, the brachioradialis is\nexceptional among muscles of the posterior (extensor) compartment in that it has\nrotated to the anterior aspect of the humerus and thus flexes the forearm at the\nelbow. It is especially active during quick movements or in the presence of\nresistance during flexion of the forearm (e.g., when a weight is lifted), acting as a\nshunt muscle resisting subluxation of the head of the radius.

Distally, its tendon runs in a groove between the ulnar head and\nits styloid process, through a separate compartment of the extensor retinaculum\nwithin the tendinous sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris.

The biceps brachii also supinates the forearm and\nis the prime mover during rapid and forceful supination against resistance when\nthe forearm is flexed (e.g., when a right-handed person drives a screw).\nThe deep extensors of the forearm act on the thumb (abductor pollicis\nlongus, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor pollicis brevis) and the index\nfinger (extensor indicis) (Figs. 3.60 to 3.62; Table 3.11). The three muscles\nacting on the thumb are deep to the superficial extensors and \u201ccrop out\u201d\n(emerge) from the furrow in the lateral part of the forearm that divides the\nextensors. Because of this characteristic, they are sometimes referred to as\noutcropping muscles of the thumb (Fig. 3.61A).\nAbductor Pollicis Longus.\nThe abductor pollicis longus (APL) has a long, fusiform belly that lies just\ndistal to the supinator (Fig. 3.60) and is closely related to the extensor pollicis\nbrevis. Its tendon, and sometimes its belly, is commonly split into two parts, one\nof which may attach to the trapezium instead of the usual site at the base of the\n1st metacarpal. The APL acts with the abductor pollicis brevis during abduction\nof the thumb and with the extensor pollicis muscles during extension of this\ndigit. Although deeply situated, the APL emerges at the wrist as one of the\noutcropping muscles. Its tendon passes deep to the extensor retinaculum with the\ntendon of the extensor pollicis brevis in the common synovial tendinous sheath\nof the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis.\nTo test the abductor pollicis longus, the thumb is abducted against resistance\nat the metacarpophalangeal joint.

In continued action after acting to\nflex the proximal phalanx of the thumb, or acting when that joint is fixed by its\nantagonists, it helps extend the 1st metacarpal and extend and abduct the hand.\nWhen the thumb is fully extended, a hollow, called the anatomical snuff box, can\n570"

The tendon passes under the extensor retinaculum in its own tunnel\n(Fig. 3.60), within the tendinous sheath of the extensor pollicis longus, medial\nto the dorsal tubercle of the radius.

Here the artery is covered by only fascia and skin. The artery can be\ncompressed against the distal end of the radius, where it lies between the\ntendons of the FCR and APL. When measuring the radial pulse rate, the pulp of\nthe thumb should not be used because it has its own pulse, which could obscure\nthe patient\u2019s pulse. If a pulse cannot be felt, try the other wrist because an\naberrant radial artery on one side may make the pulse difficult to palpate.

Ulnar nerve injuries usually occur in four places: (1) posterior\nto the medial epicondyle of the humerus, (2) in the cubital tunnel formed by the\ntendinous arch connecting the humeral and ulnar heads of the FCU, (3) at the\nwrist, and (4) in the hand.\nUlnar nerve injury occurs most commonly where the nerve passes posterior\nto the medial epicondyle of the humerus (Fig. B3.27). The injury results when\nthe medial part of the elbow hits a hard surface, fracturing the medial\nepicondyle (\u201cfunny bone\u201d). Any lesion superior to the medial epicondyle will\nproduce paresthesia of the median part of the dorsum of the hand. Compression\nof the ulnar nerve at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome) is also common (see\nthe clinical box \u201cCubital Tunnel Syndrome\u201d). Ulnar nerve injury usually\nproduces numbness and tingling (paresthesia) of the medial part of the palm\nand the medial one and a half fingers (Fig. B3.28). Pluck your ulnar nerve at the\nposterior aspect of your elbow with your index finger and you may feel tingling\nin these fingers. Severe compression may also produce elbow pain that radiates\ndistally.

The examiner uses one finger to apply resistance\nalong the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx of digits 2\u20135 individually.\nResistance may also be applied separately on the dorsal surface of the middle\nand distal phalanges of digits 2\u20135 to test extension of the interphalangeal joints,\nalso while flexion of the MP joints is maintained.\nInterossei.\nThe four dorsal interosseous muscles (dorsal interossei) are located between the\nmetacarpals; the three palmar interosseous muscles (palmar interossei) are on\nthe palmar surfaces of the metacarpals in the interosseous compartment of the\nhand (Fig. 3.75A). The 1st dorsal interosseous muscle is easy to palpate; oppose\nthe thumb firmly against the index finger and it can be easily felt. Some authors\ndescribe four palmar interossei; in so doing, they are including the deep head of\nthe FPB because of its similar innervation and placement on the thumb. The four\ndorsal interossei abduct the fingers, and the three palmar interossei adduct them\n(Fig. 3.78D, E; Table 3.14).\nA mnemonic device is to make acronyms of palmar (muscles) adduct (PAD)\nand dorsal abduct (DAB). Acting together, the dorsal and palmar interossei and\nthe lumbricals produce flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension\nof the interphalangeal joints (the so-called Z-movement). This occurs because of\ntheir attachment to the lateral bands of the extensor expansions (Fig. 3.63A, B).\nUnderstanding the Z-movement is useful because it is the opposite of claw\nhand, which occurs in ulnar paralysis when the interossei and the 3rd and 4th\nlumbricals are incapable of acting together to produce the Z-movement (see the\nclinical box \u201cInjury of Ulnar Nerve\u201d).\nTo test the palmar interossei, a sheet of paper is placed between adjacent\nfingers. The individual is asked to \u201ckeep the fingers together\u201d to prevent the\npaper from being pulled away by the examiner (Fig. 3.80A). To test the dorsal\ninterossei, the examiner holds adjacent extended and adducted fingers between\nthumb and middle finger, providing resistance as the individual attempts to\nabduct the fingers (the person is asked to \u201cspread the fingers apart\u201d) (Fig.\n621"

Distal to the carpal\ntunnel, the median nerve supplies two and a half thenar muscles and the 1st and\n2nd lumbricals (Fig. 3.85A). It also sends sensory fibers to the skin on the entire\npalmar surface, the sides of the first three digits, the lateral half of the 4th digit,\nand the dorsum of the distal halves of these digits. Note, however, that the\npalmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which supplies the central palm,\narises proximal to the flexor retinaculum and passes superficial to it (i.e., it does\nnot pass through the carpal tunnel).\nULNAR NERVE IN HAND\nThe ulnar nerve leaves the forearm by emerging from deep to the tendon of the\nFCU (Figs. 3.77 and 3.84). It continues distally to the wrist via the ulnar\n(Guyon) canal (Fig. 3.70). Here the ulnar nerve is bound by fascia to the anterior\nsurface of the flexor retinaculum as it passes between the pisiform (medially)\nand the ulnar artery (laterally).\nJust proximal to the wrist, the ulnar nerve gives off a palmar cutaneous\nbranch, which passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum and palmar\naponeurosis and supplies skin on the medial side of the palm (Fig. 3.85A).\nThe dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve supplies the medial half\nof the dorsum of the hand, the 5th finger, and the medial half of the 4th finger\n(Fig. 3.85B).

Gradually, progressive contracture of the\nlongitudinal bands produces raised ridges in the palmar skin that extend from\nthe proximal part of the hand to the base of the 4th and 5th fingers (Fig.\nB3.30B). Treatment of Dupuytren contracture usually involves surgical excision\nof all fibrotic parts of the palmar fascia to free the fingers (Salter, 1999).\n Hand Infections\nBecause the palmar fascia is thick and strong, swellings resulting from hand\ninfections usually appear on the dorsum of the hand, where the fascia is thinner.\nThe potential fascial spaces of the palm are important because they may become\ninfected. The fascial spaces determine the extent and direction of the spread of\npus formed by these infections.\nDepending on the site of infection, pus will accumulate in the thenar,\nhypothenar, midpalmar, or adductor compartments (see Fig. 3.75A). Antibiotic\ntherapy has made infections that spread beyond one of these fascial\ncompartments rare; however, an untreated infection can spread proximally from\nthe midpalmar space through the carpal tunnel into the forearm, anterior to the\npronator quadratus and its fascia.\n Tenosynovitis\nInjuries such as a puncture of a finger by a rusty nail can cause infection of the\ndigital synovial sheaths (Fig. 3.81A). When inflammation of the tendon and\nsynovial sheath occurs (tenosynovitis), the digit swells and movement becomes\npainful. Because the tendons of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers nearly always have\nseparate synovial sheaths, the infection is usually confined to the infected\nfinger. If the infection is untreated, however, the proximal ends of these sheaths\nmay rupture, allowing the infection to spread to the midpalmar space (Fig.\n3.75B).\nBecause the synovial sheath of the little finger is usually continuous with\nthe common flexor sheath (Fig. 3.81B), tenosynovitis in this finger may spread\nto the common flexor sheath and through the palm and carpal tunnel to the\n639"

Excessive friction of these tendons on their common sheath\nresults in fibrous thickening of the sheath and stenosis of the osseofibrous\ntunnel. The excessive friction is caused by repetitive forceful use of the hands\nduring gripping and wringing (e.g., squeezing water out of clothes).

The incision for\ncarpal tunnel release is made toward the medial side of the wrist and flexor\nretinaculum to avoid possible injury to the recurrent branch of the median\nnerve.\n TRAUMA TO MEDIAN NERVE\nLaceration of the wrist often causes median nerve injury because this nerve is\nrelatively close to the surface. In attempted suicides by wrist slashing, the\nmedian nerve is commonly injured just proximal to the flexor retinaculum. This\nresults in paralysis of the muscles of the thenar eminence (except the adductor\npollicis and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis) and the first two lumbricals.\nHence opposition of the thumb is not possible, and fine control movements of\nthe 2nd and 3rd digits are impaired. Sensation is also lost over the thumb and\nadjacent two and a half fingers.\nMost nerve injuries in the upper limb affect opposition of the thumb (Fig.\n3.76). Undoubtedly, injuries to the nerves supplying the intrinsic muscles of the\nhand, especially the median nerve, have the most severe effects on this complex\nmovement. If the median nerve is severed in the forearm or at the wrist, the\nthumb cannot be opposed. However, the APL and adductor pollicis (supplied by\nthe posterior interosseous and ulnar nerves, respectively) may imitate\nopposition, although ineffective.\nMedian nerve injury resulting from a perforating wound in the elbow region\nresults in loss of flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the\n2nd and 3rd digits. The ability to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints of these\nfingers is also affected because digital branches of the median nerve supply the\n1st and 2nd lumbricals. Simian hand (Fig. B3.32F) refers to a deformity in\nwhich thumb movements are limited to flexion and extension of the thumb in\nthe plane of the palm. This condition is caused by the inability to oppose and by\nlimited abduction of the thumb. The recurrent branch of the median nerve to the\nthenar muscles (Fig. 3.84A) lies subcutaneously and may be severed by\nrelatively minor lacerations of the thenar eminence.

The coracoclavicular ligament consists of two ligaments, the conoid and\ntrapezoid ligaments, which are often separated by a bursa related to the lateral\nend of the subclavius muscle. The more vertical and medially placed conoid\nligament is an inverted triangle (cone), which has its apex inferiorly where it is\nattached to the root of the coracoid process. Its wide attachment (base of the\ntriangle) is to the conoid tubercle on the inferior surface of the clavicle. The\nnearly horizontal trapezoid ligament is attached to the superior surface of the\ncoracoid process and extends laterally to the trapezoid line on the inferior surface\nof the clavicle. In addition to augmenting the AC joint, the coracoclavicular\nligament provides the means by which the scapula and free limb are (passively)\nsuspended from the clavicular strut.\nMOVEMENTS OF ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT\nThe acromion of the scapula rotates on the acromial end of the clavicle. These\nmovements are associated with motion at the physiological scapulothoracic joint\n(Figs. 3.25, 3.91, and 3.92; Table 3.5).

Superiorly, this part of the\ncapsule encroaches on the root of the coracoid process so that the fibrous layer of\nthe capsule encloses the proximal attachment of the long head of the biceps\nbrachii to the supraglenoid tubercle of scapula within the joint.\nThe joint capsule has two apertures: (1) an opening between the tubercles of\nthe humerus for passage of the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii (Fig.\n3.93A) and (2) an opening situated anteriorly, inferior to the coracoid process\nthat allows communication between the subtendinous bursa of subscapularis and\nthe synovial cavity of the joint. The inferior part of the joint capsule, the only\npart not reinforced by the rotator cuff muscles, is its weakest area. Here, the\ncapsule is particularly lax and lies in folds when the arm is adducted; however, it\nbecomes taut when the arm is abducted.\nThe synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous layer of the\ncapsule and reflects from it onto the glenoid labrum and the humerus, as far as\nthe articular margin of the head (Figs. 3.93A, 3.94A, and 3.95A).\nThe synovial membrane also forms a tubular sheath for the tendon of the\nlong head of the biceps brachii, where it lies in the intertubercular sulcus of the\nhumerus and passes into the joint cavity (Fig. 3.93A).\nLIGAMENTS OF GLENOHUMERAL JOINT\n660"

This ligament converts\nthe groove into a canal, which holds the synovial sheath and tendon of the biceps\nbrachii in place during movements of the glenohumeral joint.\nThe coraco-acromial arch is an extrinsic, protective structure formed by the\nsmooth inferior aspect of the acromion and the coracoid process of the scapula,\nwith the coraco-acromial ligament spanning between them (Fig. 3.95B). This\nosseoligamentous structure forms a protective arch that overlies the humeral\nhead, preventing its superior displacement from the glenoid cavity. The coraco-\nacromial arch is so strong that a forceful superior thrust of the humerus will not\nfracture it; the humeral shaft or clavicle fractures first.\nTransmitting force superiorly along the humerus (e.g., when standing at a\ndesk and partly supporting the body with the outstretched limbs), the humeral\nhead presses against the coraco-acromial arch. The supraspinatus muscle passes\nunder this arch and lies deep to the deltoid as its tendon blends with the joint\ncapsule of the glenohumeral joint as part of the rotator cuff (Fig. 3.94).\nMovement of the supraspinatus tendon, passing to the greater tubercle of the\nhumerus, is facilitated as it passes under the arch by the subacromial bursa\n(Fig. 3.95A), which lies between the arch superiorly and the tendon and tubercle\ninferiorly.\nMOVEMENTS OF GLENOHUMERAL JOINT\n661"

Recurrent inflammation of the rotator cuff,\nespecially the relatively avascular area of the supraspinatus tendon, is a\ncommon cause of shoulder pain and results in tears of the musculotendinous\nrotator cuff.\nRepetitive use of the rotator cuff muscles (e.g., by baseball pitchers) may\nallow the humeral head and rotator cuff to impinge on the coracoacromial arch\n(Fig. 3.95B), producing irritation of the arch and inflammation of the rotator\ncuff. As a result, degenerative tendonitis of the rotator cuff develops. Attrition\nof the supraspinatus tendon also occurs (Fig. B3.34).\nTo test for degenerative tendonitis/tendinosis of the rotator cuff, the person\nis asked to lower the fully abducted limb slowly and smoothly. From\napproximately 90\u00b0 abduction, the limb will suddenly drop to the side in an\nuncontrolled manner if the rotator cuff (especially its supraspinatus part) is\ndiseased and/or torn.\nRotator cuff injuries may also occur during a sudden strain of the muscles,\nfor example, when an older person strains to lift something, such as a window\nthat is stuck. This strain may rupture a previously degenerated\nmusculotendinous rotator cuff. A fall on the shoulder may also tear a previously\ndegenerated rotator cuff. Often the intracapsular part of the tendon of the long\nhead of the biceps brachii becomes frayed (even worn away), leaving it\nadherent to the intertubercular sulcus. As a result, shoulder stiffness occurs.\nBecause they fuse, the integrity of the fibrous layer of the joint capsule of the\nglenohumeral joint is usually compromised when the rotator cuff is injured. As\na result, the articular cavity communicates with the subacromial bursa. Because\nthe supraspinatus muscle is no longer functional with a complete tear of the\nrotator cuff, the person cannot initiate abduction of the upper limb. If the arm is\npassively abducted 15\u00b0 or more, the person can usually maintain or continue the\nabduction using the deltoid.\n698"

Because the presence of the\ncoraco-acromial arch and support of the rotator cuff are effective in preventing\nupward dislocation, most dislocations of the humeral head occur in the\ndownward (inferior) direction (Fig. B3.35). However, they are described\nclinically as anterior or (more rarely) posterior dislocations, indicating whether\nthe humeral head has descended anterior or posterior to the infraglenoid\ntubercle and long head of the triceps. The head ends up lying anterior or\nposterior to the glenoid cavity.\nAnterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint occurs most often in young\nadults, particularly athletes. It is usually caused by excessive extension and\nlateral rotation of the humerus (Fig. B3.36). The head of the humerus is driven\ninfero-anteriorly, and the fibrous layer of the joint capsule and glenoid labrum\nmay be stripped from the anterior aspect of the glenoid cavity in the process. A\nhard blow to the humerus when the glenohumeral joint is fully abducted tilts the\nhead of the humerus inferiorly onto the inferior weak part of the joint capsule.\nThis may tear the capsule and dislocate the shoulder so that the humeral head\ncomes to lie inferior to the glenoid cavity and anterior to the infraglenoid\ntubercle.

Commonly,\nthe term chest is used as a synonym for thorax; however, the chest is much more\nextensive than the thoracic wall and cavity contained within it. The chest is\ngenerally conceived as the superior part of the trunk that is broadest superiorly\nowing to the presence of the pectoral (shoulder) girdle (clavicles and scapulae),\nwith much of its girth accounted for by the pectoral and scapular musculature\nand, in adult females, the breasts.\nThe thoracic cavity and its wall have the shape of a truncated cone, being\nnarrowest superiorly, with the circumference increasing inferiorly, and reaching\nits maximum size at the junction with the abdominal portion of the trunk. The\nwall of the thoracic cavity is relatively thin, essentially as thick as its skeleton.\nThe thoracic cage (rib cage), with the horizontal bars formed by ribs and costal\ncartilages, is also supported by the vertical sternum and thoracic vertebrae (Fig.\n4.1). Furthermore, the floor of the thoracic cavity (thoracic diaphragm) is deeply\ninvaginated inferiorly (i.e., is pushed upward) by viscera of the abdominal\ncavity. Consequently, nearly the lower half of the thoracic wall surrounds and\nprotects abdominal rather than thoracic viscera (e.g., liver). Thus, the thorax and\n718"

Resection may\nbe required to relieve pressure on these structures, which can be performed\nthrough a transaxillary approach (incision in axillary fossa or armpit). Lumbar\nribs are less common. Supernumerary (extra) ribs also have clinical significance\nin that they may confuse the identification of vertebral levels in radiographs and\nother diagnostic images.\n Protective Function and Aging of Costal\nCartilages\nCostal cartilages provide resilience to the thoracic cage, preventing many blows\nfrom fracturing the sternum and/or ribs. Because of the remarkable elasticity of\nthe ribs and costal cartilages in children, chest compression may produce injury\nwithin the thorax even in the absence of a rib fracture. In elderly people, the\ncostal cartilages lose some of their elasticity and become brittle; they may\nundergo calcification, making them radiopaque (i.e., appear white in\nradiographs). Consequently, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR,\nutilizing sternal compression) on the elderly is more likely to fracture ribs.\n742"

Never having been aware of their xiphoid\nprocess before, they fear they have developed a tumor. Care must be taken\nduring high abdominal (laparotomy) incisions, to avoid injuring or cutting the\nxiphoid process. Such injuries of the cartilage can result in heterotropic\nossification of the upper part of the incision.\n Sternal Fractures\nDespite the subcutaneous location of the sternum, sternal fractures are not\ncommon. Crush injuries can occur after traumatic compression of the thoracic\nwall, for example, in automobile accidents when the driver\u2019s chest is forced into\nthe steering column. The installation and use of air bags in vehicles has reduced\nthe number of sternal fractures. A fracture of the sternal body is usually a\ncomminuted fracture (a break resulting in several pieces). Displacement of the\nbone fragments is uncommon because the sternum is invested by deep fascia\n(fibrous continuities of radiate sternocostal ligaments; Fig. 4.6A) and the sternal\nattachments of the pectoralis major muscles. The most common site of sternal\nfracture in elderly people is at the sternal angle, where the manubriosternal joint\nhas fused. The fracture results in dislocation of the manubriosternal joint.\nThe concern in sternal injuries is not primarily for the fracture itself, but for\nthe likelihood of heart injury (myocardial contusion, cardiac rupture,\ntamponade) and/or lung injury. The mortality (death rate) associated with\nsternal fractures is 25\u201345%, largely owing to these underlying injuries. Patients\nwith sternal contusion should be evaluated for underlying visceral injury (Marx\net al., 2014).\n743"

The flexibility of ribs and costal cartilages\nenables spreading of the halves of the sternum during procedures requiring\nmedian sternotomy. Such \u201csternal splitting\u201d also gives good exposure for\nremoval of tumors in the superior lobes of the lungs. After surgery, the halves\nof the sternum are usually joined using wire sutures.

The needle first pierces the thin cortical\nbone and then enters the vascular spongy bone. Sternal biopsy is commonly\nused to obtain specimens of marrow for transplantation and for detection of\nmetastatic cancer and blood dyscrasias (abnormalities).\n Sternal Anomalies\nThe sternum develops through the fusion of bilateral, vertical condensations of\nprecartilaginous tissue, sternal bands or bars.

Near the angles of the ribs, the nerves pass between the internal intercostal\nand innermost intercostal muscles. At this point, the intercostal nerves pass to\nand then continue to course in or just inferior to the costal grooves, running\ninferior to the intercostal arteries (which, in turn, run inferior to the intercostal\nveins). The neurovascular bundles (especially the vessels) are thus sheltered by\nthe inferior margins of the overlying ribs. Collateral branches of these nerves\narise near the angles of the ribs and run along the superior border of the rib\nbelow. The nerves continue anteriorly between the internal and innermost\nintercostal muscles, supplying these and other muscles and giving rise to lateral\ncutaneous branches in approximately the midaxillary line (MAL). Anteriorly, the\nnerves appear on the internal surface of the internal intercostal muscle. Near the\nsternum, the nerves turn anteriorly, passing between the costal cartilages to\nbecome anterior cutaneous branches.\nThrough its posterior ramus and the lateral and anterior cutaneous branches\nof its anterior ramus, most thoracic spinal nerves (T2\u2013T12) supply a strip-like\ndermatome of the trunk extending from the posterior median line to the anterior\nmedian line (Fig. 4.18). The group of muscles supplied by the posterior ramus\nand anterior ramus (intercostal nerve) of each pair of thoracic spinal nerves\nconstitutes a myotome. The myotomes of most thoracic spinal nerves (T2\u2013T11)\ninclude the intercostal, subcostal, transversus thoracis, levatores costarum, and\nserratus posterior muscles associated with the intercostal space that includes the\nanterior ramus (intercostal nerve) of the specific spinal nerve, plus the overlying\nportion of the deep muscles of the back.\n759"

Each duct has a dilated portion deep to the areola, the lactiferous\nsinus, in which a small droplet of milk accumulates or remains in the nursing\nmother. As the baby begins to nurse, compression of the areola (and lactiferous\nsinus beneath it) expresses the accumulated droplets and encourages the neonate\nto continue nursing as the hormonally mediated let-down reflex ensues. The\nmother\u2019s milk is secreted into\u2014not sucked from the gland by\u2014the baby\u2019s\nmouth.\nThe areolae contain numerous sebaceous glands, which enlarge during\npregnancy and secrete an oily substance that provides a protective lubricant for\nthe areola and nipple. The areola and nipple are particularly subject to chaffing\nand irritation as mother and baby begin the nursing experience. The nipples are\nconical or cylindrical prominences in the centers of the areolae. The nipples have\nno fat, hair, or sweat glands. The tips of the nipples are fissured with the\nlactiferous ducts opening into them. The nipples are composed mostly of\ncircularly arranged smooth muscle fibers that compress the lactiferous ducts\nduring lactation and erect the nipples in response to stimulation, as when a baby\nbegins to nurse.\nThe mammary glands are modified sweat glands; therefore, they have no\ncapsule or sheath. The rounded contour and most of the volume of the breasts are\nproduced by subcutaneous fat, except during pregnancy when the mammary\nglands enlarge and new glandular tissue forms. The milk-secreting alveoli (L.\nsmall hollow spaces) are arranged in grape-like clusters. In some women, the\n775"

            "Text": "Breast Cancer in Men\nApproximately 1.5% of breast cancers occur in men. As in women, the cancer\nusually metastasizes to axillary lymph nodes but also to bone, pleura, lung,\nliver, and skin. Breast cancer affects approximately 1,000 men per year in the\nUnited States (Swartz, 2014). A visible and/or palpable subareolar mass or\nsecretion from a nipple may indicate a malignant tumor. Breast cancer in males\ntends to infiltrate the pectoral fascia, pectoralis major, and apical lymph nodes\nin the axilla. Although breast cancer is uncommon in men, the consequences are\nserious because they are frequently not detected until extensive metastases have\noccurred\u2014for example, in bone.\n Gynecomastia\nSlight temporary enlargement of the breasts (hypertrophy) is a normal\noccurrence (frequency = 70%) in males at puberty (age 10\u201312 years). Breast\nhypertrophy in males after puberty (gynecomastia) is relatively rare (<1%) and\nmay be age or drug related (e.g., after treatment with diethylstilbestrol for\nprostate cancer). Gynecomastia may also result from an imbalance between\nestrogenic and androgenic hormones or from a change in the metabolism of sex\nhormones by the liver. Thus, a finding of gynecomastia should be regarded as a\nsymptom, and an evaluation must be initiated to rule out important potential\ncauses, such as suprarenal or testicular cancers (Goroll, 2014). Approximately\n40% of postpubertal males with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY trisomy) have\ngynecomastia (Fig. B4.8). Klinefelter syndrome is also characterized by small\ntestes and disproportionately long lower limbs (Moore et al., 2016).\n792"

Three lines of pleural reflection\noutline the extent of the pulmonary cavities on each side: sternal, costal, and\ndiaphragmatic. The outlines of the right and left pulmonary cavities are\nasymmetrical (i.e., are not mirror images of each other) because the heart is\nturned and extends toward the left side, imposing on the left cavity more\nmarkedly than on the right.\nDeviation of the heart to the left side primarily affects the right and left\nsternal lines of pleural reflection, which are asymmetrical. The sternal lines are\nsharp or abrupt and occur where the costal pleura is continuous with the\nmediastinal pleura anteriorly. Starting superiorly from the cupulae (Fig. 4.31A),\nthe right and left lines of sternal reflection run inferomedially, passing posterior\nto the sternoclavicular joints to meet at the anterior median line (AML), posterior\nto the sternum at the level of its sternal angle.

The sternal line of\nreflection on the left side, however, descends in the AML only to the level of the\n4th costal cartilage. Here it passes to the left margin of the sternum and\ncontinues inferiorly to the 6th costal cartilage, creating a shallow notch as it runs\nlateral to an area of direct contact between the pericardium (heart sac) and the\nanterior thoracic wall.

The hilum (\u201cdoorway\u201d) can be likened to the area\nof earth where a plant\u2019s roots enter the ground. Medial to the hilum, the lung root\nis enclosed within the area of continuity between the parietal and the visceral\nlayers of pleura\u2014the pleural sleeve (mesopneumonium).\nInferior to the root of the lung, this continuity between parietal and visceral\npleura forms the pulmonary ligament, extending between the lung and the\nmediastinum, immediately anterior to the esophagus (Fig. 4.34A\u2013D). The\npulmonary ligament consists of a double layer of pleura separated by a small\namount of connective tissue. When the root of the lung is severed and the lung is\nremoved, the pulmonary ligament appears to hang from the root. To visualize the\nroot of the lung, the pleural sleeve surrounding it, and the pulmonary ligament\nhanging from it, put on an extra-large lab coat and abduct your upper limb. Your\nforearm is comparable to the root of the lung, and your coat sleeve represents the\npleural sleeve surrounding it. The pulmonary ligament is comparable to the slack\nof the sleeve as it hangs from your forearm.

The sublaryngeal airway constitutes the\ntracheobronchial tree. The trachea (described with the superior mediastinum,\nlater in this chapter), located within the superior mediastinum, constitutes the\ntrunk of the tree.

Auscultation assesses airflow\nthrough the tracheobronchial tree into the lobes of the lung.

The pleural fluid prevents the lungs from collapse and causes the lungs to\nexpand when the thorax expands for inhalation. \u2022 Most of the parietal pleura is\nnamed for the structures it covers: costal, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic parts.\n\u2022 The cervical pleura extends into the root of the neck forming a dome above\nthe anterior aspect of the 1st rib and clavicle. \u2022 Parietal pleura is sensitive,\nbeing innervated by the phrenic and intercostal nerves. \u2022 Because the lungs do\nnot completely fill the pulmonary cavities, and because of the protrusion of the\ndiaphragm and underlying abdominal viscera into the inferior thoracic\naperture, a peripheral gutter\u2014the costodiaphragmatic recess\u2014is formed.\n841"

If extensive pericardial effusion exists, the compromised volume of the\nsac does not allow full expansion of the heart, limiting the amount of blood the\nheart can receive, which in turn reduces cardiac output. Cardiac tamponade\n(heart compression) is a potentially lethal condition because heart volume is\nincreasingly compromised by the fluid outside the heart but inside the\npericardial cavity.\nBlood in the pericardial cavity, hemopericardium, likewise produces\ncardiac tamponade. Hemopericardium may result from perforation of a\nweakened area of heart muscle owing to a previous myocardial infarction (MI)\nor heart attack, from bleeding into the pericardial cavity after cardiac\noperations, or from stab wounds. This situation is especially lethal because of\nthe high pressure involved and the rapidity with which the fluid accumulates.\nThe heart is increasingly compressed and circulation fails. The veins of the face\nand neck become engorged because of the backup of blood, beginning where\nthe SVC enters the pericardium.\nIn patients with pneumothorax\u2014air or gas in the pleural cavity\u2014the air\nmay dissect along connective tissue planes and enter the pericardial sac,\nproducing a pneumopericardium.\n Pericardiocentesis\nDrainage of fluid from the pericardial cavity, pericardiocentesis, is usually\nnecessary to relieve cardiac tamponade. To remove the excess fluid, a wide-\nbore needle may be inserted through the left 5th or 6th intercostal space near the\nsternum. This approach to the pericardial sac is possible because the cardiac\nnotch in the left lung and the shallower notch in the left pleural sac leave part of\nthe pericardial sac exposed\u2014the bare area of the pericardium (Figs. 4.31A and\n4.32). The pericardial sac may also be reached via the xiphocostal angle by\npassing the needle superoposteriorly (Fig. B4.21). At this site, the needle avoids\nthe lung and pleurae and enters the pericardial cavity; however, care must be\ntaken not to puncture the internal thoracic artery or its terminal branches. In\nacute cardiac tamponade from hemopericardium, an emergency thoracotomy\nmay be performed (the thorax is rapidly opened) so that the pericardial sac may\nbe incised to immediately relieve the tamponade and establish stasis of the\n857"

Contrast media highlights left ventricle\nand outflow tract.\nThe septomarginal trabecula (moderator band) is a curved muscular bundle\nthat traverses the right ventricular chamber from the inferior part of the IVS to\nthe base of the anterior papillary muscle. This trabecula is important because it\ncarries part of the right branch of the AV bundle, a part of the conducting\nsystem of the heart to the anterior papillary muscle (see \u201cStimulating and\nConducting System of Heart,\u201d later in this chapter). This \u201cshortcut\u201d across the\nchamber seems to facilitate conduction time, allowing coordinated contraction of\nthe anterior papillary muscle.\nThe right atrium contracts when the right ventricle is empty and relaxed;\nthus, blood is forced through this orifice into the right ventricle, pushing the\ncusps of the tricuspid valve aside like curtains. The inflow of blood into the right\nventricle (inflow tract) enters posteriorly; and when the ventricle contracts, the\noutflow of blood into the pulmonary trunk (outflow tract) leaves superiorly and\nto the left (Fig. 4.55B). Consequently, the blood takes a U-shaped path through\nthe right ventricle, changing direction about 140\u00b0. This change in direction is\naccommodated by the supraventricular crest, which deflects the incoming flow\ninto the main cavity of the ventricle and the outgoing flow into the conus\narteriosus toward the pulmonary orifice.

The AV node is located in the postero-inferior region of the\ninteratrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus (Figs. 4.60A\u2013C and\n4.62B). The signal generated by the SA node passes through the walls of the\nright atrium, propagated by the cardiac muscle (myogenic conduction), which\ntransmits the signal rapidly from the SA node to the AV node. The AV node\nthen distributes the signal to the ventricles through the AV bundle (Fig. 4.63B).\nSympathetic stimulation speeds up conduction, and parasympathetic stimulation\nslows it down. The AV bundle, the only bridge between the atrial and ventricular\nmyocardium, passes from the AV node through the fibrous skeleton of the heart\n(see Fig. 4.52) and along the membranous part of the IVS.\nAt the junction of the membranous and muscular parts of the IVS, the AV\nbundle divides into right and left bundles (Fig. 4.63B). These branches proceed\non each side of the muscular IVS deep to the endocardium and then ramify into\nsubendocardial branches (Purkinje fibers), which extend into the walls of the\nrespective ventricles. The subendocardial branches of the right bundle stimulate\nthe muscle of the IVS, the anterior papillary muscle through the septomarginal\ntrabecula (moderator band), and the wall of the right ventricle. The left bundle\ndivides near its origin into approximately six smaller tracts, which give rise to\nsubendocardial branches that stimulate the IVS, the anterior and posterior\npapillary muscles, and the wall of the left ventricle.\nThe AV node is supplied by the AV nodal artery, the largest and usually the\nfirst IV septal branch of the posterior IV artery, a branch of the RCA in 80% of\npeople (Fig. 4.60A\u2013C). Thus, the arterial supply to both the SA and AV nodes is\nusually derived from the RCA. However, the AV bundle traverses the center of\nthe IVS, the anterior two thirds of which is supplied by the septal branches of the\nanterior IV branch of the LCA (Fig. 4.60C, D).\nImpulse generation and conduction can be summarized as follows:\nThe SA node initiates an impulse that is rapidly conducted to cardiac muscle\nfibers in the atria, causing them to contract (Fig. 4.63A).\nThe impulse spreads by myogenic conduction, which rapidly transmits the\nimpulse from the SA node to the AV node.\nThe signal is distributed from the AV node through the AV bundle and its\nbranches (the right and left bundles), which pass on each side of the IVS to\nsupply subendocardial branches to the papillary muscles and the walls of the\nventricles (Fig. 4.63B).\n889"

Direct adrenergic stimulation from\nthe sympathetic nerve fibers, as well as indirect suprarenal (adrenal) hormone\nstimulation, increases atrial and ventricular contractility. Most adrenergic\nreceptors on coronary blood vessels are \u03b22-receptors, which, when activated,\ncause relaxation (or perhaps inhibition) of vascular smooth muscle and,\ntherefore, dilation of the arteries (Wilson-Pauwels et al., 1997).

On sudden\nblockage of a large coronary branch, some infarction is probably inevitable, but\nthe extent of the area damaged depends on the degree of development of\ncollateral anastomotic channels. If large branches of both coronary arteries are\npartially obstructed, an extracardiac collateral circulation may be used to supply\nblood to the heart. These collaterals connect the coronary arteries with the vasa\nvasorum (small arteries) in the tunica adventitia of the aorta and pulmonary\narteries and with branches of the internal thoracic, bronchial, and phrenic\narteries. Clinical studies show that anastomoses cannot provide collateral routes\nquickly enough to prevent the effects of sudden coronary artery occlusion. The\nfunctional value of these anastomoses thus appears to be more effective in\nslowly progressive CAD in individuals that are physically active.\n Angina Pectoris\nPain that originates in the heart is called angina or angina pectoris (L. angina,\nstrangling pain + L. pectoris, of the chest). Individuals with angina commonly\ndescribe the transient (15 seconds to 15 minutes) but moderately severe\nconstricting pain as tightness in the thorax, deep to the sternum. The pain is the\nresult of ischemia of the myocardium that falls short of inducing the cellular\nnecrosis that defines infarction.\nMost often, angina results from narrowed coronary arteries. The reduced\nblood flow results in less oxygen being delivered to the cardiac striated muscle\ncells. As a result of the limited anaerobic metabolism of the myocytes, lactic\nacid accumulates and the pH is reduced in affected areas of the heart. Pain\nreceptors in muscle are stimulated by lactic acid. Strenuous exercise (especially\nafter a heavy meal), sudden exposure to cold, and stress all require increased\nactivity on the part of the heart, but the occluded vessels cannot provide it.\nWhen food enters the stomach, blood flow to it and other parts of the digestive\ntract is increased. As a result, some blood is diverted from other organs,\nincluding the heart.\nAnginal pain is relieved by a period of rest (1\u20132 minutes are often\nadequate). Sublingual nitroglycerin (medication placed or sprayed under the\ntongue for absorption through the oral mucosa) may be administered because it\ndilates the coronary (and other) arteries.

Furthermore, the dilated vessels\naccommodate more of the blood volume, so less blood arrives in the heart,\nrelieving heart congestion. Thus, the angina is usually relieved. Such angina\nprovides a warning that the coronary arteries are compromised and that there is\na need for a change of lifestyle, a health care intervention, or both.\nThe pain resulting from MI is usually more severe than with angina\npectoris, and the pain resulting from the infarction does not disappear after 1\u20132\nminutes of rest.\n Coronary Bypass Graft\nPatients with obstruction of their coronary circulation and severe angina may\nundergo a coronary bypass graft operation. A segment of an artery or vein is\nconnected to the ascending aorta or to the proximal part of a coronary artery and\nthen to the coronary artery distal to the stenosis (Fig. B4.32). The great\nsaphenous vein is commonly harvested for coronary bypass surgery because it\n(1) has a diameter equal to or greater than that of the coronary arteries, (2) can\nbe easily dissected from the lower limb, and (3) and offers relatively lengthy\nportions with a minimum occurrence of valves or branching. Reversal of the\nimplanted segment of vein can negate the effect of a valve if a valved segment\nmust be used. Use of the radial artery in bypass surgery has become\nincreasingly more common. A coronary bypass graft shunts blood from the\naorta to a stenotic coronary artery to increase the flow distal to the obstruction.\nSimply stated, it provides a detour around the stenotic area (arterial stenosis) or\nblockage (arterial atresia). Revascularization of the myocardium may also be\nachieved by surgically anastomosing an internal thoracic artery with a coronary\nartery. Hearts with coronary bypass grafts are commonly found during\ndissections in the gross anatomy laboratory.\n909"

The lymphatic vessels of the thymus end in\nthe parasternal, brachiocephalic, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes.\nGREAT VESSELS\nThe right and left brachiocephalic veins are formed posterior to the\nsternoclavicular (SC) joints by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian\nveins. At the level of the inferior border of the 1st right costal cartilage, the\nbrachiocephalic veins unite to form the SVC (Figs. 4.66B and 4.67B). The left\nbrachiocephalic vein is more than twice as long as the right brachiocephalic vein\nbecause it passes from the left to the right side, anterior to the roots of the three\nmajor branches of the arch of the aorta (Fig. 4.67B). The brachiocephalic veins\nshunt blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the right atrium.\nThe superior vena cava (SVC) returns blood from all structures superior to\nthe diaphragm, except the lungs and heart. It passes inferiorly and ends at the\nlevel of the 3rd costal cartilage, where it enters the right atrium of the heart. The\nSVC lies in the right side of the superior mediastinum, anterolateral to the\ntrachea and posterolateral to the ascending aorta. The right phrenic nerve lies\nbetween the SVC and the mediastinal pleura. The terminal half of the SVC is in\nthe middle mediastinum, where it lies beside the ascending aorta and forms the\nposterior boundary of the transverse pericardial sinus (Fig. 4.46).\nThe ascending aorta, approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, begins at the aortic\norifice. Its only branches are the coronary arteries, arising from the aortic sinuses\n(Fig. 4.56B). The ascending aorta is intrapericardial (Fig. 4.67A, B); for this\nreason, and because it lies inferior to the transverse thoracic plane, it is\nconsidered a content of the middle mediastinum (part of inferior mediastinum).\nThe arch of the aorta (aortic arch), the curved continuation of the ascending\naorta (Figs. 4.66A and 4.68; see Table 4.5), begins posterior to the 2nd right\nsternocostal (SC) joint at the level of the sternal angle. It arches superiorly,\nposteriorly and to the left, and then inferiorly. The arch ascends anterior to the\nright pulmonary artery and the bifurcation of the trachea, reaching its apex at the\nleft side of the trachea and esophagus as it passes over the root of the left lung.\nThe arch descends posterior to the left root of the lung beside the T4 vertebra.\nThe arch ends by becoming the thoracic (descending) aorta posterior to the 2nd\nleft sternocostal joint.\nTABLE 4.5.

Posterior\nmediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 4.74A, B) lie posterior to the pericardium,\nwhere they are related to the esophagus and thoracic aorta. There are several\nnodes posterior to the inferior part of the esophagus and more (up to eight)\nanterior and lateral to it. The posterior mediastinal lymph nodes receive lymph\nfrom the esophagus, the posterior aspect of the pericardium and diaphragm, and\nthe middle posterior intercostal spaces. Lymph from the nodes drains to the right\nor left venous angles via the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct.\n943"

An accessory artery to\nthe thyroid gland, the thyroid ima artery (L. arteria thyroidea ima), may arise\nfrom the arch of the aorta or the brachiocephalic artery.\nAnomalies of Arch of Aorta\nThe most superior part of the arch of the aorta is usually approximately 2.5\ncm inferior to the superior border of the manubrium, but it may be more\nsuperior or inferior. Sometimes, the arch curves over the root of the right lung\nand passes inferiorly on the right side, forming a right arch of the aorta. In\nsome cases, the abnormal arch, after passing over the root of the right lung,\npasses posterior to the esophagus to reach its usual position on the left side.\nLess frequently, a double arch of the aorta forms a vascular ring around the\nesophagus and trachea (Fig. B4.37C). A trachea that is compressed enough to\naffect breathing may require surgical division of the vascular ring.\n Aneurysm of Ascending Aorta\nThe distal part of the ascending aorta receives a strong thrust of blood when the\nleft ventricle contracts.

It is a flexible, dynamic container, housing most of the organs of the\nalimentary system and part of the urogenital system. Containment of the\nabdominal organs and their contents is provided by musculo-aponeurotic walls\nanterolaterally, the diaphragm superiorly, and the muscles of the pelvis\ninferiorly. The anterolateral musculo-aponeurotic walls are suspended between\nand supported by two bony rings (the inferior margin of the thoracic skeleton\nsuperiorly and the pelvic girdle inferiorly) linked by a semirigid lumbar vertebral\ncolumn in the posterior abdominal wall. Interposed between the more rigid\nthorax and pelvis, this arrangement enables the abdomen to enclose and protect\nits contents while providing the flexibility required by respiration, posture, and\nlocomotion.\n971"

Both of\nthese planes have the advantage of intersecting palpable structures.\nSome clinicians use the transpyloric and interspinous planes to establish the\nnine regions. The transpyloric plane, extrapolated midway between the superior\nborders of the manubrium of the sternum and the pubic symphysis (typically the\nL1 vertebral level), commonly transects the pylorus (the distal, more tubular part\nof the stomach) when the patient is recumbent (supine or prone) (Fig. 5.1).\nBecause the viscera sag with the pull of gravity, the pylorus usually lies at a\nlower level when the individual is standing erect. The transpyloric plane is a\nuseful landmark because it also transects many other important structures: the\nfundus of the gallbladder, neck of the pancreas, origins of the superior\nmesenteric artery (SMA) and hepatic portal vein, root of the transverse\nmesocolon, duodenojejunal junction, and hila of the kidneys. The interspinous\nplane passes through the easily palpated ASIS on each side (Table 5.1B).\nFor more general clinical descriptions, four quadrants of the abdominal\ncavity (right and left upper and lower quadrants) are defined by two readily\ndefined planes: (1) the transverse transumbilical plane, passing through the\numbilicus or navel (and typically the intervertebral [IV] disc between the L3 and\nL4 vertebrae), dividing it into upper and lower halves, and (2) the vertical\nmedian plane, passing longitudinally through the body, dividing it into right and\nleft halves (Table 5.1C).\nIt is important to know what organs are located in each abdominal region or\nquadrant so that one knows where to auscultate, percuss, and palpate them\n(Table 5.1) and to record the locations of findings during a physical examination.\nANTEROLATERAL ABDOMINAL WALL\nAlthough the abdominal wall is continuous, it is subdivided into the anterior\nwall, right and left lateral walls, and posterior wall for descriptive purposes\n(Fig. 5.3). The abdominal wall is musculo-aponeurotic, except for the posterior\nwall, which includes the lumbar region of the vertebral column.

When tensed\nin muscular people, the areas of muscle between the tendinous intersections\nbulge outward. The intersections, indicated by grooves in the skin between the\nmuscular bulges, usually occur at the level of the xiphoid process, at the\numbilicus, and halfway between these structures.\nPYRAMIDALIS\nThe pyramidalis is a small, insignificant triangular muscle that is absent in\napproximately 20% of people. It lies anterior to the inferior part of the rectus\nabdominis and attaches to the anterior surface of the pubis and the anterior pubic\nligament. It ends in the linea alba, which is especially thickened for a variable\ndistance superior to the pubic symphysis. The pyramidalis tenses the linea alba.\nWhen present, surgeons use the attachment of the pyramidalis to the linea alba as\na landmark for median abdominal incision (Skandalakis et al., 2009).\nRECTUS SHEATH, LINEA ALBA, AND UMBILICAL\nRING\nThe rectus sheath is the strong, incomplete fibrous compartment of the rectus\nabdominis and pyramidalis muscles (Figs. 5.7 to 5.9).

Throughout\nthe length of the sheath, the fibers of the anterior and posterior layers of the\nsheath interlace in the anterior median line to form the complex linea alba.\nThe posterior layer of the rectus sheath is also deficient superior to the costal\nmargin because the transversus abdominis is continued superiorly as the\ntransversus thoracis, which lies internal to the costal cartilages (see Fig. 4.14),\nand the internal oblique attaches to the costal margin. Hence, superior to the\ncostal margin, the rectus abdominis lies directly on the thoracic wall (Fig. 5.9B).\nThe linea alba, running vertically the length of the anterior abdominal wall\nand separating the bilateral rectus sheaths (Fig. 5.7A), narrows inferior to the\numbilicus to the width of the pubic symphysis and widens superiorly to the\nwidth of the xiphoid process.

Compressing the abdominal\nviscera and increasing intra-abdominal pressure elevates the relaxed diaphragm\nto expel air during respiration and more forcibly for coughing, sneezing, nose\nblowing, voluntary eructation (burping), and yelling or screaming. When the\ndiaphragm contracts during inspiration, the anterolateral abdominal wall expands\nas its muscles relax to make room for the organs, such as the liver, that are\npushed inferiorly. The combined actions of the anterolateral muscles also\nproduce the force required for defecation (discharge of feces), micturition\n(urination), vomiting, and parturition (childbirth). Increased intra-abdominal\n(and intrathoracic) pressure is also involved in heavy lifting, the resulting force\nsometimes producing a hernia.\nThe anterolateral abdominal muscles are also involved in movements of the\ntrunk at the level of the lumbar vertebrae and in controlling the tilt of the pelvis\nwhen standing for maintenance of posture (resisting lumbar lordosis).\nConsequently, strengthening the anterolateral abdominal wall musculature\nimproves standing and sitting posture. The rectus abdominis is a powerful flexor\nof the thoracic and especially lumbar regions of the vertebral column, pulling the\nanterior costal margin and pubic crest toward each other. The oblique abdominal\nmuscles also assist in movements of the trunk, especially lateral flexion of the\nlumbar vertebrae and rotation of the lower thoracic vertebral column.

            "Text": "A prominent abdomen is normal in infants and young children because their\ngastrointestinal tracts contain considerable amounts of air. In addition, their\nanterolateral abdominal cavities are enlarging and their abdominal muscles are\ngaining strength. An infant\u2019s and young child\u2019s relatively large liver also\naccounts for some bulging. Abdominal muscles protect and support the viscera\nmost effectively when they are well toned; thus, the well-conditioned adult of\nnormal weight has a flat or scaphoid (lit. boat shaped; i.e., hollowed or concave)\nabdomen when in the supine position.\nThe six common causes of abdominal protrusion begin with the letter F:\nfood, fluid, fat, feces, flatus, and fetus. Eversion of the umbilicus may be a sign\nof increased intra-abdominal pressure, usually resulting from ascites (abnormal\naccumulation of serous fluid in the peritoneal cavity), or a large mass (e.g., a\ntumor, a fetus, or an enlarged organ such as the liver). Excess fat accumulation\ndue to overnourishment most commonly involves the subcutaneous fatty layer;\nhowever, there may also be excessive depositions of extraperitoneal fat in some\ntypes of obesity. Tumors and organomegaly (organ enlargement such as\nsplenomegaly\u2014enlargement of the spleen) also produce abdominal\nenlargement. When the anterior abdominal muscles are underdeveloped or\nbecome atrophic, as a result of old age or insufficient exercise, they provide\ninsufficient tonus to resist the increased weight of a protuberant abdomen on the\nanterior pelvis. The pelvis tilts anteriorly at the hip joints when standing (the\npubis descends and the sacrum ascends) producing excessive lordosis of the\nlumbar region (Fig. B4.17C).\n Abdominal Hernias\nThe anterolateral abdominal wall may be the site of abdominal hernias. These\nhernias commonly occur wherever something (vessels, spermatic cord, etc.)\npierces the abdominal wall creating a potential weakness.\nMost hernias occur in the inguinal, umbilical, and epigastric regions (see the\nClinical Box \u201cInguinal Hernias,\u201d p. 434). Umbilical hernias are common in\nneonates because the anterior abdominal wall is relatively weak in the umbilical\nring, which had failed to close normally, causing a protrusion at the umbilicus,\nespecially in low-birth-weight infants. Umbilical hernias are usually small and\nresult from increased intra-abdominal pressure in the presence of weakness and\nincomplete closure of the anterior abdominal wall after ligation of the umbilical\n1000"

The lines along which the fibers of the abdominal aponeuroses interlace are\nalso potential sites of herniation (see Fig. 5.6B). Occasionally, gaps exist where\nthese fiber exchanges occur\u2014for example, in the midline or in the transition\nfrom aponeurosis to rectus sheath. These gaps may be congenital, the result of\nthe stresses of obesity and aging, or the consequence of surgical (e.g.,\nlaparoscopic) or traumatic wounds.\nAn epigastric hernia, a hernia in the epigastric region through the linea\nalba, occurs in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus.\nThese are typically just lobules of fat. They are often painful, especially if a\nnerve is compressed. Spigelian hernias are those occurring along the semilunar\nlines (see Table 5.1B). These types of hernia tend to occur in people older than\n40 years and are usually associated with obesity. The hernial sac, composed of\nperitoneum, is often covered with only skin and fatty subcutaneous tissue, but\nmay occur deep to the muscle.\nNEUROVASCULATURE OF\nANTEROLATERAL ABDOMINAL WALL\n Palpation of Anterolateral Abdominal\nWall\nWarm hands are important when palpating the abdominal wall because cold\nhands make the anterolateral abdominal muscles tense, producing involuntary\nspasms of the muscles, known as guarding. Intense guarding, board-like\nreflexive muscular rigidity that cannot be willfully suppressed, occurs during\npalpation when an organ (such as the appendix) is inflamed and in itself\nconstitutes a clinically significant sign of acute abdomen. The involuntary\nmuscular spasms attempt to protect the viscera from pressure, which is painful\nwhen an abdominal infection is present. The common nerve supply of the skin\nand muscles of the wall explains why these spasms occur.\nPalpation of abdominal viscera is performed with the patient in the supine\nposition with thighs and knees semiflexed to enable adequate relaxation of the\n1001"

Some people tend to place their hands behind their heads when lying\nsupine, which also tightens the muscles and makes the examination difficult.\nPlacing the upper limbs at the sides and putting a pillow under the person\u2019s\nknees tends to relax the anterolateral abdominal muscles.\n Superficial Abdominal Reflexes\nThe abdominal wall is the only protection most of the abdominal organs have.\nConsequently, the wall will react if an organ is diseased or injured. With the\nperson supine and the muscles relaxed, the superficial abdominal reflex is\nelicited by quickly stroking horizontally, lateral to medial, toward the\numbilicus. Usually, contraction of the abdominal muscles is felt; this reflex may\nnot be observed in obese people. Similarly, any injury to the abdominal skin\nresults in a rapid reflex contraction of the abdominal muscles.\n Injury to Nerves of Anterolateral\nAbdominal Wall\nThe inferior thoracic spinal nerves (T7\u2013T12) and the iliohypogastric and ilio-\ninguinal nerves (L1) approach the abdominal musculature separately to provide\nthe multisegmental innervation of the abdominal muscles. Thus, they are\ndistributed across the anterolateral abdominal wall, where they run oblique but\nmostly horizontal courses. They are susceptible to injury in surgical incisions or\nfrom trauma at any level of the abdominal wall. Injury to nerves of the\nanterolateral abdominal wall may result in weakening of the muscles. The most\ncommon cause is surgery. An oblique subcostal incision, used for liver/pancreas\nsurgery (in the past for open cholecystectomy), can result in denervation of part\nof the abdominal wall if the nerves are not carefully identified and spared,\nwhich is not always possible. In the inguinal region, such a weakness may\npredispose an individual to development of an inguinal hernia (see the Clinical\nBox \u201cInguinal Hernias,\u201d p. 434).\n1002"

            "Text": "Abdominal Surgical Incisions\nSurgeons use various abdominal surgical incisions to gain access to the\nabdominal cavity. When possible, the incisions follow the cleavage lines\n(Langer lines) in the skin (see Fig. 1.7 and Chapter 1, Overview and Basic\nConcepts, for discussion of these lines). The incision that allows adequate\nexposure, and secondarily, the best possible cosmetic effect, is chosen. The\nlocation of the incision also depends on the type of operation, the location of the\norgan(s) the surgeon wants to reach, bony or cartilaginous boundaries,\navoidance of (especially motor) nerves, maintenance of blood supply, and\nminimizing injury to muscles and fascia of the abdominal wall while aiming for\nfavorable healing. Thus, before making an incision, the surgeon considers the\ndirection of the muscle fibers and the location of the aponeuroses and nerves.\nConsequently, a variety of incisions are routinely used, each having specific\nadvantages and limitations.\nInstead of transecting muscles, causing irreversible necrosis (death) of\nmuscle fibers, the surgeon splits them in the direction of (and between) their\nfibers. The rectus abdominis is an exception; it can be transected because its\nmuscle fibers run short distances between tendinous intersections and the\nsegmental nerves supplying it enter the lateral part of the rectus sheath where\nthey can be located and preserved. Generally, incisions are made in the part of\nthe anterolateral abdominal wall that gives the freest access to the targeted\norgan with the least disturbance to the nerve supply to the muscles. Muscles and\nviscera are retracted toward, not away from, their neurovascular supply.\nCutting a motor nerve paralyzes the muscle fibers supplied by it, thereby\nweakening the anterolateral abdominal wall. However, because of overlapping\nareas of innervation between nerves, one or two small branches of nerves may\nusually be cut without a noticeable loss of motor supply to the muscles or loss\nof sensation to the skin.\nLONGITUDINAL INCISIONS\nLongitudinal (vertical) incisions, such as median (midline) and paramedian\nincisions (Fig. B5.1), are preferred for exploratory operations because they offer\ngood exposure of and access to the viscera and can be extended as necessary\nwith minimal complication.\n1003"

The posterior layer of the rectus sheath and the peritoneum are then\nincised to enter the peritoneal cavity.\nOBLIQUE AND TRANSVERSE INCISIONS\nThe direction of oblique and transverse incisions is related to muscle fiber\norientation, nearby hard tissue (costal margin or iliac or pubic crest), or\nminimizing potential nerve damage. Gridiron (muscle-splitting) incisions are\noften used for an appendectomy. The oblique McBurney incision is made at the\nMcBurney point, approximately 2.5 cm superomedial to the ASIS on the spino-\numbilical line. The external oblique aponeurosis is incised inferomedially in the\ndirection of its fibers and retracted. The musculo-aponeurotic fibers of the\ninternal oblique and transversus abdominis are then split in the line of their\nfibers and retracted. The iliohypogastric nerve, running deep to the internal\noblique, is identified and preserved. Carefully made, the entire exposure cuts no\nmusculo-aponeurotic fibers; therefore, when the incision is closed, the muscle\nfibers move together and the abdominal wall is as strong after the operation as it\nwas before. Suprapubic incisions (\u201cbikini\u201d incisions) are made at the pubic\nhairline. These incisions\u2014horizontal with a slight convexity\u2014are used for most\ngynecological and obstetrical operations (e.g., for cesarean delivery). The linea\nalba and anterior layers of the rectus sheaths are transected and resected\nsuperiorly, and the rectus muscles are retracted laterally or divided through their\ntendinous parts allowing reattachment without muscle fiber injury. The\niliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves are identified and preserved.\nTransverse incisions through the anterior layer of the rectus sheath and\nrectus abdominis provide good access and cause the least possible damage to\nthe nerve supply of the rectus abdominis. This muscle may be divided\ntransversely without serious damage because a new transverse band forms when\nthe muscle segments are rejoined. Transverse incisions are not made through\nthe tendinous intersections because cutaneous nerves and branches of the\nsuperior epigastric vessels pierce these fibrous regions of the muscle.\nTransverse incisions can be increased laterally as needed to increase exposure\nbut are not utilized for exploratory procedures because superior and inferior\nextension is difficult, for example, for colostomy or ileostomy.\nSubcostal incisions provide access to the gallbladder and biliary ducts on\nthe right side and the spleen on the left.

The fibers of the\naponeuroses interlace in the midline, forming the linea alba, and continue into\nthe aponeuroses of the contralateral muscles. \u2022 The aponeurotic fibers of the\nexternal obliques are also continuous across the midline with those of the\ncontralateral internal oblique muscles. \u2022 Three layers of flat, bilateral digastric\nmuscles encircle the trunk, forming oblique and transverse girdles that enclose\nthe abdominal cavity. \u2022 In the upper two thirds of the abdominal wall, the\naponeurotic layers separate on each side of the linea alba to form longitudinal\nsheaths that contain the rectus muscles. This brings them into a functional\nrelationship with the flat muscles in which the vertical muscles brace the\ngirdles anteriorly. \u2022 In the lower third of the anterior abdominal wall, the\naponeuroses of all three layers of flat muscles pass anterior to the rectus\nmuscles (recti). \u2022 As flexors of the trunk, the recti are the antagonistic partners\nof the deep (extensor) muscles of the back.

This weak area, occurring in relation to\nstructures traversing the body wall, is the site of direct and indirect inguinal and\nfemoral hernias.\nINGUINAL CANAL\nThe inguinal canal is formed in relation to the relocation of the testis during\nfetal development. The inguinal canal in adults is an oblique passage,\napproximately 4 cm long, directed inferomedially through the inferior part of the\nanterolateral abdominal wall. It lies parallel and superior to the medial half of the\ninguinal ligament (see Figs. 5.14 and 5.15). The main occupant of the inguinal\ncanal is the spermatic cord in males and the round ligament of the uterus in\nfemales. These are functionally and developmentally distinct structures that\noccur in the same location. The inguinal canal also contains blood and lymphatic\nvessels, the ilio-inguinal nerve, and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve\n(n. to cremaster\u2014see Fig. 7.29A) in both sexes. The inguinal canal has an\nopening at each end:\nThe deep (internal) inguinal ring is the entrance to the inguinal canal. It is\nlocated superior to the middle of the inguinal ligament and lateral to the\ninferior epigastric artery (Fig. 5.14). It is the beginning of an evagination in\nthe transversalis fascia that forms an opening like the entrance to a cave\n(Figs. 5.7B, 5.13, and 5.15). Through this opening, the extraperitoneal ductus\ndeferens (vas deferens) and testicular vessels in males (or round ligament of\nthe uterus in females) and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve pass to\nenter the inguinal canal. The transversalis fascia itself continues into the\ncanal, forming the innermost covering (internal fascia) of the structures\ntraversing the canal.\nThe superficial (external) inguinal ring is the exit by which the spermatic\ncord in males, or the round ligament in females, and ilio-inguinal nerve\nemerge from the inguinal canal (Figs. 5.7A, 5.14, and 5.15).

The inguinal triangle separates these formations from the structures of\nthe femoral sheath (femoral vessels and femoral canal) that traverse the medial\npart of the subinguinal space. Most groin hernias in males pass superior to the\niliopubic tract (inguinal hernias), whereas most pass inferior to it in females\n(femoral hernias).

The testes develop in the extraperitoneal\nconnective tissue in the superior lumbar region of the posterior abdominal wall\n(Fig. 5.16A). The male gubernaculum is a fibrous tract connecting the primordial\ntestis to the anterolateral abdominal wall at the site of the future deep ring of the\ninguinal canal. A peritoneal diverticulum, the processus vaginalis, traverses the\ndeveloping inguinal canal, carrying muscular and fascial layers of the\nanterolateral abdominal wall before it as it enters the primordial scrotum. By the\n12th week, the testis is in the pelvis, and by 28 weeks (7th month), it lies close to\nthe developing deep inguinal ring (Fig. 5.16B). The testis begins to pass through\nthe inguinal canal during the 28th week and takes approximately 3 days to\ntraverse it. Approximately 4 weeks later, the testis enters the scrotum (Fig.\n5.16C). As the testis, its duct (ductus deferens), and its vessels and nerves\nrelocate, they are ensheathed by musculofascial extensions of the anterolateral\nabdominal wall, which account for the presence of their derivatives in the adult\nscrotum: the internal and external spermatic fasciae and cremaster muscle (Fig.\n5.15). The stalk of the processus vaginalis normally degenerates; however, its\ndistal saccular part forms the tunica vaginalis, the serous sheath of the testis and\nepididymis (Moore et al., 2016).\n1016"

The\npampiniform plexus is part of the thermoregulatory system of the testis (along\nwith the cremasteric and dartos muscles) helping to keep this gland at a constant\ntemperature. The veins of each pampiniform plexus converge superiorly,\nforming a right testicular vein, which enters the inferior vena cava (IVC), and a\nleft testicular vein, which enters the left renal vein.\nThe lymphatic drainage of the testis follows the testicular artery and vein to\nthe right and left lumbar (caval/aortic) and pre-aortic lymph nodes (see Fig.\n5.19). The autonomic nerves of the testis arise as the testicular plexus of nerves\non the testicular artery, which contains sympathetic fibers from the T10(\u2212T11)\nsegment of the spinal cord, visceral afferent fibers, and perhaps vagal\nparasympathetic fibers. Autonomic fibers may also reach the testis via the\ndeferential plexus.\nEPIDIDYMIS\nThe epididymis is an elongated structure on the posterior surface of the testis\n(Fig. 5.20). Efferent ductules of the testis transport newly developed sperms to\nthe epididymis from the rete testis. The epididymis is formed by minute\nconvolutions of the duct of the epididymis, so tightly compacted that they\nappear solid (Fig. 5.21). The duct becomes progressively smaller as it passes\nfrom the head of the epididymis on the superior part of the testis to its tail. In the\nlengthy course of this duct, the sperms are stored and continue to mature. The\nepididymis consists of the following:\nHead of the epididymis: the superior expanded part that is composed of\nlobules formed by the coiled ends of 12\u201314 efferent ductules.\nBody of the epididymis: major part consisting of the tightly convoluted duct\nof the epididymis.\nTail of the epididymis: tapering continuation with the ductus deferens, the\nduct that transports the sperms from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct\nfor expulsion via the urethra during ejaculation (see Chapter 6, Pelvis and\n1030"

It is a\nvestige of the site of attachment of the umbilical cord and is the reference point\nfor the transumbilical plane (Fig. 5.22). This puckered indentation of skin in the\ncenter of the anterior abdominal wall is typically at the level of the IV disc\nbetween the L3 and L4 vertebrae. However, its height on the wall varies\nconsiderably, and is lower when abdominal subcutaneous fat is abundant.\nRegardless of its level, the umbilicus lies within the T10 dermatome. The\nepigastric fossa (pit of the stomach) is a slight depression in the epigastric\nregion, just inferior to the xiphoid process. This fossa is particularly noticeable\nwhen a person is in the supine position because the abdominal organs spread out,\ndrawing the anterolateral abdominal wall posteriorly in this region. The pain\ncaused by pyrosis (\u201cheartburn,\u201d resulting from reflux of gastric acid into the\nesophagus) is often felt at this site. The 7th\u201310th costal cartilages unite on each\nside of the epigastric fossa, their medial borders forming the costal margin.\nAlthough the abdominal cavity extends higher, the costal margin is the\ndemarcation between the thoracic and abdominal portions of the body wall.\nWhen a person is in the supine position, observe the rise and fall of the\nabdominal wall with respiration: superiorly with inspiration and inferiorly with\nexpiration. The rectus abdominis muscles can be palpated and observed when a\nsupine person is asked to raise their head and shoulders against resistance.\n1031"

About 95% of\nundescended testes occur unilaterally. If a testis has not descended or is not\nretractable (capable of being drawn down), the condition is cryptorchidism (G.\norchis, testis + L. from G. kryptos, hidden).

However, some lymphatic vessels follow\nthe course of the round ligament through the inguinal canal.

Peritoneal fluid lubricates the peritoneal surfaces,\nenabling the viscera to move over each other without friction, and allowing the\nmovements of digestion. In addition to lubricating the surfaces of the viscera, the\nperitoneal fluid contains leukocytes and antibodies that resist infection.\nLymphatic vessels, particularly on the inferior surface of the constantly active\ndiaphragm, absorb the peritoneal fluid. The peritoneal cavity is completely\nclosed in males. However, there is a communication pathway in females to the\nexterior of the body through the uterine tubes, uterine cavity, and vagina. This\ncommunication constitutes a potential pathway of infection from the exterior.\nEmbryology of Peritoneal Cavity\nWhen it is initially formed, the gut (embryonic digestive tube) is the same length\nas the developing body. It undergoes exuberant growth, however, to provide the\nlarge absorptive surface required by nutrition. By the end of the 10th week of\ndevelopment, the gut is much longer than the body that contains it. For this\nincrease in length to occur, the gut must gain freedom of movement relative to\nthe body wall at an early stage, while still maintaining the connection with it\nnecessary for innervation and blood supply. This growth (and later, the activity\nof the gut) is accommodated by the development of a serous cavity within the\ntrunk that houses the increasingly lengthy and convoluted gut in a relatively\ncompact space. The rate of growth of the gut initially outpaces the development\nof adequate space within the trunk (body), and for a time, the rapidly lengthening\ngut extends outside the developing anterior body wall (see the Clinical Box\n\u201cBrief Review of Embryological Rotation of the Midgut,\u201d p. 481).\nEarly in its development, the embryonic body cavity (intraembryonic\ncoelom) is lined with mesoderm, the primordium of the peritoneum. At a slightly\nlater stage, the primordial abdominal cavity is lined with parietal peritoneum\nderived from mesoderm, which forms a closed sac. The lumen of the peritoneal\nsac is the peritoneal cavity. As the organs develop, they invaginate (protrude) to\nvarying degrees into the peritoneal sac, acquiring a peritoneal covering, the\nvisceral peritoneum. A viscus (organ) such as the kidney protrudes only partially\ninto the peritoneal cavity; hence, it is primarily retroperitoneal, always remaining\nexternal to the peritoneal cavity and posterior to the peritoneum lining the\nabdominal cavity.

Generally, viscera that vary relatively\nlittle in size and shape, such as the kidneys, are retroperitoneal, whereas viscera\nthat undergo marked changes in shape owing to filling, emptying, and peristalsis,\nsuch as the stomach, are invested with visceral peritoneum. Intraperitoneal\nviscera with a mesentery, such as most of the small intestine, are mobile, the\ndegree of which varies with the length of the mesentery. Although the liver and\nspleen do not change shape as a result of intrinsic activity (although they may\nslowly change in size when engorged with blood), their need for a covering of\nvisceral peritoneum is dictated by the need to accommodate passive changes in\nposition imposed by the adjacent, highly active diaphragm.\nAs organs protrude into the peritoneal sac, their vessels, nerves, and\nlymphatics remain connected to their extraperitoneal (usually retroperitoneal)\nsources or destinations so that these connecting structures lie between the layers\nof the peritoneum forming their mesenteries. Initially, the entire primordial gut is\nsuspended in the center of the peritoneal cavity by a posterior mesentery attached\nto the midline of the posterior body wall. As the organs grow, they gradually\nreduce the size of the peritoneal cavity until it is only a potential space between\nthe parietal and visceral layers of peritoneum. As a consequence, several parts of\nthe gut come to lie against the posterior abdominal wall, and their posterior\nmesenteries become gradually reduced because of pressure from overlying\norgans (Fig. 5.24). For example, during development, the growing coiled mass\nof small intestine pushes the part of the gut that will become the descending\ncolon to the left side and presses its mesentery against the posterior abdominal\nwall. The mesentery is held there until the layer of peritoneum that formed the\nleft side of the mesentery and the part of the visceral peritoneum of the colon\nlying against the body wall fuse with the parietal peritoneum of the body wall.\nAs a result, the colon becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall on the left\nside with peritoneum covering only its anterior aspect. The descending colon (as\nwell as the ascending colon on the right side) has thus become secondarily\nretroperitoneal, having once been intraperitoneal (Moore et al., 2016).\n1048"

If the abdomen is drawn in as the chest expands\n(paradoxical abdominothoracic rhythm) and muscle rigidity is present, either\nperitonitis or pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) may be present. Because\nthe intense pain worsens with movement, people with peritonitis commonly lie\nwith their knees flexed to relax their anterolateral abdominal muscles. They also\nbreathe shallowly (and hence more rapidly), reducing the intra-abdominal\npressure and pain. The suction effect of the diaphragm during respiration draws\nfluid (e.g., from a perforated viscus) into the subphrenic spaces. Hence,\nsubphrenic abscess is a frequent complication of peritonitis.\n Peritoneal Adhesions and Adhesiotomy\nIf the peritoneum is damaged, by a stab wound, for example, or infected, the\nperitoneal surfaces become inflamed, making them sticky with fibrin. As\nhealing occurs, the fibrin may be replaced with fibrous tissue, forming abnormal\nattachments between the visceral peritoneum of adjacent viscera, or between the\nvisceral peritoneum of an organ and the parietal peritoneum of the adjacent\nabdominal wall. Adhesions (scar tissue) may also form after an abdominal\noperation (e.g., owing to a ruptured appendix) and limit the normal movements\nof the viscera. This tethering may cause chronic pain or emergency\ncomplications such as intestinal obstruction when the intestine becomes twisted\naround an adhesion (volvulus).\nAdhesiolysis refers to the surgical separation of adhesions. Adhesions are\noften found during dissection of cadavers (see, e.g., the adhesion binding the\nspleen to the diaphragm in Fig. 5.39B).\n Abdominal Paracentesis\nMost cases of peritonitis are secondary, having a surgical cause. Ascites can\nresult from cirrhosis of the liver or in association with malignancy. In rare\ncases, individuals with chronic ascites from a condition such as cirrhosis will\ndevelop primary peritonitis in which the ascites becomes infected without a\nsurgical cause.\n1060"

In the supine position, the stomach commonly lies in the right and left\nupper quadrants, or epigastric, umbilical, and left hypochondrium and flank\nregions (Fig. 5.36A). In the erect position, the stomach moves inferiorly. In\nasthenic (thin, weak) individuals, the body of the stomach may extend into the\npelvis (Fig. 5.36B).\n1076"

(C and E\ncourtesy of Dr. E. L. Lansdown, Professor of Medical Imaging,\nUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.)\nCardia: the part surrounding the cardial orifice (opening), the superior\nopening or inlet of the stomach. In the supine position, the cardial orifice\nusually lies posterior to the 6th left costal cartilage, 2\u20134 cm from the median\nplane at the level of the T11 vertebra.\nFundus: the dilated superior part that is related to the left dome of the\ndiaphragm, limited inferiorly by the horizontal plane of the cardial orifice.\nThe cardial notch is between the esophagus and the fundus. The fundus may\nbe dilated by gas, fluid, food, or any combination of these. In the supine\nposition, the fundus usually lies posterior to the left 6th rib in the plane of the\nMCL (Fig. 5.36A).\nBody: the major part of the stomach between the fundus and pyloric antrum.\nPyloric part: the funnel-shaped outflow region of the stomach; its wider\npart, the pyloric antrum, leads into the pyloric canal, its narrower part (Fig.\n5.37A\u2013E). The pylorus (G., gatekeeper) is the distal, sphincteric region of\nthe pyloric part. It is a marked thickening of the circular layer of smooth\nmuscle that controls discharge of the stomach contents through the pyloric\norifice (inferior opening or outlet of the stomach) into the duodenum (Fig.\n5.37D).\nIntermittent emptying of the stomach occurs when intragastric pressure\novercomes the resistance of the pylorus. The pylorus is normally tonically\ncontracted so that the pyloric orifice is reduced, except when emitting chyme\n(semifluid mass). At irregular intervals, gastric peristalsis pushes the chyme\nthrough the pyloric canal and orifice into the small intestine for further mixing,\ndigestion, and absorption.\nIn the supine position, the pyloric part of the stomach lies at the level of the\ntranspyloric plane, midway between the jugular notch superiorly and the pubic\ncrest inferiorly (Fig. 5.36A). The plane transects the 8th costal cartilages and the\nL1 vertebra. When erect, its location varies from the L2 through L4 vertebra.\nThe pyloric orifice is approximately 1.25 cm right of the midline.\nThe stomach also features two curvatures (Fig. 5.37A\u2013C):\n1080"

It\npasses inferiorly to the left from the junction of the 5th intercostal space and\nMCL and then curves to the right, passing deep to the 9th or 10th left\ncartilage as it continues medially to reach the pyloric antrum.\nBecause of the unequal lengths of the lesser curvature on the right and the\ngreater curvature on the left, in most people the shape of the stomach resembles\nthe letter J.\nINTERIOR OF STOMACH\nThe smooth surface of the gastric mucosa is reddish brown during life, except in\nthe pyloric part, where it is pink. In life, it is covered by a continuous mucous\nlayer that protects its surface from the gastric acid the stomach\u2019s glands secrete.\nWhen contracted, the gastric mucosa is thrown into longitudinal ridges or\nwrinkles called gastric folds (gastric rugae) (Fig. 5.38A, B); they are most\nmarked toward the pyloric part and along the greater curvature. During\nswallowing, a temporary groove or furrow-like gastric canal forms between the\nlongitudinal gastric folds along the lesser curvature. It can be observed\nradiographically and endoscopically. The gastric canal forms because of the firm\nattachment of the gastric mucosa to the muscular layer, which does not have an\noblique layer at this site. Saliva and small quantities of masticated food and other\nfluids drain along the gastric canal to the pyloric canal when the stomach is\nmostly empty.

            "Text": "curves anteriorly to join the jejunum at the duodenojejunal flexure, supported by\nthe attachment of a suspensory muscle of the duodenum (ligament of Treitz).\nThis muscle is composed of a slip of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a\nfibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the third and fourth parts of the\nduodenum. Contraction of this muscle widens the angle of the duodenojejunal\nflexure, facilitating movement of the intestinal contents. The suspensory muscle\npasses posterior to the pancreas and splenic vein and anterior to the left renal\nvein.\nThe arteries of the duodenum arise from the celiac trunk and the superior\nmesenteric artery (Fig. 5.44). The celiac trunk, via the gastroduodenal artery\nand its branch, the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, supplies the\nduodenum proximal to the entry of the bile duct into the descending part of the\nduodenum. The superior mesenteric artery, through its branch, the inferior\npancreaticoduodenal artery, supplies the duodenum distal to the entry of the\nbile duct. The pancreaticoduodenal arteries lie in the curve between the\nduodenum and the head of the pancreas and supply both structures. The\nanastomosis of the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (i.e.,\nbetween the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries) occurs between the entry of\nthe bile duct and the junction of the descending and inferior parts of the\nduodenum. An important transition in the blood supply of the digestive tract\noccurs here: proximally, extending orad (toward the mouth) to and including the\nabdominal part of the esophagus, the blood is supplied to the digestive tract by\nthe celiac trunk; distally, extending aborad (away from the mouth) to the left\ncolic flexure, the blood is supplied by the SMA. The basis of this transition in\nblood supply is embryological; this is the junction of the foregut and midgut.\nThe veins of the duodenum follow the arteries and drain into the hepatic\nportal vein, some directly and others indirectly, through the superior mesenteric\nand splenic veins (Fig. 5.41).\nThe lymphatic vessels of the duodenum follow the arteries. The anterior\nlymphatic vessels drain into the pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes, located along\nthe superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, and into the pyloric lymph\nnodes, which lie along the gastroduodenal artery (Fig. 5.46). The posterior\nlymphatic vessels pass posterior to the head of the pancreas and drain into the\nsuperior mesenteric lymph nodes. Efferent lymphatic vessels from the\nduodenal lymph nodes drain into the celiac lymph nodes.\n1096"

The SMV\ndrains blood from the same portions of the intestine into the\nhepatic portal vein.\nThe superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies the jejunum and ileum via\njejunal and ileal arteries (Fig. 5.49B).\nThe SMA usually arises from the abdominal aorta at the level of the L1\nvertebra, approximately 1 cm inferior to the celiac trunk, and runs between the\nlayers of the mesentery, sending 15\u201318 branches to the jejunum and ileum (see\nalso Figs. 5.54 and 5.55).

It was believed that when the cecum is\ndistended or when it contracts, the lips and frenula actively tighten, closing the\nvalve to prevent reflux from the cecum into the ileum. However, direct\nobservation by endoscopy in living persons does not support this description.\nThe circular muscle is poorly developed around the orifice; therefore, the valve\nis unlikely to have any sphincteric action that controls passage of the intestinal\ncontents from the ileum into the cecum. The orifice is usually closed by tonic\ncontraction, however, appearing as an ileal papilla on the cecal side (Fig.\n5.53B). The papilla probably serves as a relatively passive flap valve, preventing\nreflux from the cecum into the ileum as contractions occur to propel contents up\nthe ascending colon and into the transverse colon (Magee and Dalley, 1986).\nThe appendix (vermiform appendix; L. vermis, worm-like) is a blind\nintestinal diverticulum (6\u201310 cm in length) that contains masses of lymphoid\ntissue. It arises from the posteromedial aspect of the cecum inferior to the\nileocecal junction.

It passes\nsuperiorly on the right side of the abdominal cavity from the cecum to the right\nlobe of the liver, where it turns to the left at the right colic flexure (hepatic\nflexure). This flexure lies deep to the 9th and 10th ribs and is overlapped by the\ninferior part of the liver.\nThe ascending colon is narrower than the cecum and is secondarily\nretroperitoneal along the right side of the posterior abdominal wall. The\nascending colon is usually covered by peritoneum anteriorly and on its sides;\nhowever, in approximately 25% of people, it has a short mesentery. The\nascending colon is separated from the anterolateral abdominal wall by the greater\nomentum. A deep vertical groove lined with parietal peritoneum, the right\nparacolic gutter, lies between the lateral aspect of the ascending colon and the\nadjacent abdominal wall (see Fig. 5.49A).\nThe arterial supply to the ascending colon and right colic flexure is from\nbranches of the SMA, the ileocolic and right colic arteries (Figs. 5.54 and 5.55;\nTable 5.9). These arteries anastomose with each other and with the right branch\nof the middle colic artery, the first of a series of anastomotic arcades that is\ncontinued by the left colic and sigmoid arteries to form a continuous arterial\nchannel, the marginal artery (juxtacolic artery). This artery parallels and\nextends the length of the colon close to its mesenteric border.\nVenous drainage from the ascending colon flows through tributaries of the\nSMV, the ileocolic and right colic veins (Fig. 5.56A). The lymphatic drainage\npasses first to the epicolic and paracolic lymph nodes, next to the ileocolic and\nintermediate right colic lymph nodes, and from them to the superior mesenteric\nlymph nodes (Fig. 5.56B). The nerve supply to the ascending colon is derived\nfrom the superior mesenteric nerve plexus (Fig. 5.56C).\nThe transverse colon is the third, longest, and most mobile part of the large\nintestine (Fig. 5.52). It crosses the abdomen from the right colic flexure to the\nleft colic flexure, where it turns inferiorly to become the descending colon. The\nleft colic flexure (splenic flexure) is usually more superior, more acute, and less\nmobile than the right colic flexure. It lies anterior to the inferior part of the left\nkidney and attaches to the diaphragm through the phrenicocolic ligament (see\nFig. 5.26). The transverse colon and its mesentery, the transverse mesocolon,\nloop down, often inferior to the level of the iliac crests (Fig. 5.57B). The\nmesentery is adherent to or fused with the posterior wall of the omental bursa.\nThe root of the transverse mesocolon (see Fig. 5.49A) lies along the inferior\nborder of the pancreas and is continuous with the parietal peritoneum posteriorly.\n1115"

Thus, peritoneum covers the colon anteriorly and\nlaterally and binds it to the posterior abdominal wall. Although retroperitoneal,\nthe descending colon, especially in the iliac fossa, has a short mesentery in\napproximately 33% of people; however, it is usually not long enough to cause\nvolvulus (twisting) of the colon. As it descends, the colon passes anterior to the\nlateral border of the left kidney. As with the ascending colon, the descending\ncolon has a paracolic gutter (the left one) on its lateral aspect (see Fig. 5.49A).\nThe sigmoid colon, characterized by its S-shaped loop of variable length,\nlinks the descending colon and the rectum (Fig. 5.52). The sigmoid colon\nextends from the iliac fossa to the third sacral (S3) vertebra, where it joins the\nrectum.

People experiencing severe chronic anxiety are most prone to the\ndevelopment of peptic ulcers. They often have gastric acid secretion rates that\nare markedly higher than normal between meals. It is thought that the high acid\nin the stomach and duodenum overwhelms the bicarbonate normally produced\nby the duodenum and reduces the effectiveness of the mucous lining, leaving it\nvulnerable to H. pylori. The bacteria erode the protective mucous lining of the\nstomach, inflaming the mucosa and making it vulnerable to the effects of the\ngastric acid and digestive enzymes (pepsin) produced by the stomach.\nIf the ulcer erodes into the gastric arteries, it can cause life-threatening\nbleeding. Because the secretion of acid by parietal cells of the stomach is\nlargely controlled by the vagus nerves, vagotomy (surgical section of the vagus\nnerves) was performed historically to reduce the production of acid in some\npeople with chronic or recurring ulcers. The procedure has become relatively\nrare due to testing for and treatment of H. pylori. Vagotomy may also be\nperformed in conjunction with resection of an ulcerated area to reduce acid\nsecretion. Truncal vagotomy (surgical section of the vagal trunks) was rarely\nperformed because the innervation of other abdominal structures was also\nsacrificed (Fig. B5.11A). Proximal gastric vagotomy denervated the stomach\nbut the vagal branches to the pylorus, liver and biliary ducts, intestines, and\nceliac plexus were preserved (Fig. B5.11B). Selective proximal vagotomy\nattempted to denervate even more specifically the area in which the parietal\ncells are located, hoping to affect the acid-producing cells while sparing other\ngastric function (motility) stimulated by the vagus nerve (Fig. B5.11C).\n1126"

It is attached to the umbilical vesicle (yolk sac) by the omphalo-\nenteric duct (yolk stalk). As it returns to the abdominal cavity, the midgut\nrotates 270\u00b0 around the axis of the SMA (Fig. B5.14B, C). As the relative size\nof the liver and kidneys decreases, the midgut returns to the abdominal cavity as\nincreased space becomes available. As the parts of the intestine reach their\ndefinitive positions, their mesenteric attachments undergo modification (Fig.\nB5.14D, E). Some mesenteries shorten and others disappear (e.g., most of\nduodenal mesentery) as most of the duodenum and pancreas and the ascending\nand descending colons become secondarily retroperitoneal. Some of the\nconsequences of normal rotation of the midgut include the following: (1) the\nduodenum passes posterior to the SMA; (2) the transverse colon and mesocolon\nare transversely oriented, passe anterior to the SMA, and divide the peritoneal\ncavity into supra- and infracolic compartments; (3) the ascending and\ndescending colons lie on the right and left sides, respectively, and are\nretroperitoneal; (4) most of the ileum occupies the left superolateral part of the\ninfracolic compartment; and (5) most of the ileum, cecum, and appendix occupy\nthe right inferolateral part of the infracolic compartment.Malrotation of the\nmidgut (intestine) results in several congenital anomalies such as volvulus\n(twisting) of the intestine (Moore et al., 2016).\n1131"

An inflamed appendix in this position is more difficult to\nremove, especially laparoscopically. The appendix may project inferiorly\ntoward or across the pelvic brim. The anatomical position of the appendix\ndetermines the symptoms and the site of muscular spasm and tenderness when\nthe appendix is inflamed.

In older people, the\nobstruction usually results from a fecalith (coprolith), a concretion that forms\naround a center of fecal matter. When secretions from the appendix cannot\nescape, the appendix swells, stretching the visceral peritoneum. The pain of\nappendicitis usually commences as a vague pain in the peri-umbilical region\nbecause afferent pain fibers enter the spinal cord at the T10 level (see Fig.\nB5.12). Later, severe pain in the right lower quadrant results from irritation of\nthe parietal peritoneum lining the posterior abdominal wall (usually formed by\nthe psoas and iliacus muscles in the region of the appendix).

While typically\nthe inflamed appendix is deep to the McBurney point, the site of maximal pain\nand tenderness indicates the actual location.\nLaparoscopic appendectomy has become a standard procedure selectively\nutilized for removing the appendix. The peritoneal cavity is first inflated with\ncarbon dioxide gas, distending the abdominal wall, to provide viewing and\nworking space. The laparoscope is passed through a small incision in the\nanterolateral abdominal wall (e.g., near or through the umbilicus).

The terminating ileum is\ndelivered through and sutured to the periphery of an opening in the anterolateral\nabdominal wall, allowing the egress of its contents. Similarly, following a\npartial colectomy, a colostomy or sigmoidostomy is performed to create an\nartificial cutaneous opening for the terminal part of the colon (Fig. B5.16B). An\nostomy may be permanent or temporary. Sometimes surgeons create a\ntemporary ostomy to allow the bowel to heal after resection and anastomosis.\nThe ostomy prevents fecal contents from going through the anastomosis; thus, if\nthe anastomosis has a small imperfection causing a leak, the result is not\ncatastrophic peritonitis.\n1138"

            "Text": "Prenatally, the spleen is a hematopoietic (blood-forming) organ, but after\nbirth, it is involved primarily in identifying, removing, and destroying expended\nred blood cells (RBCs) and broken-down platelets and in recycling iron and\nglobin. The spleen serves as a blood reservoir, storing RBCs and platelets, and,\nto a limited degree, can provide a sort of \u201cself-transfusion\u201d as a response to the\nstress imposed by hemorrhage. In spite of its size and the many useful and\nimportant functions it provides, it is not a vital organ (not necessary to sustain\nlife).\nTo accommodate these functions, the spleen is a soft, vascular (sinusoidal)\nmass with a relatively delicate fibroelastic capsule (Fig. 5.58E). The thin capsule\nis covered with a layer of visceral peritoneum that entirely surrounds the spleen\nexcept at the splenic hilum, where the splenic branches of the splenic artery and\nvein enter and leave (Fig. 5.58D). Consequently, it is capable of marked\nexpansion and some relatively rapid contraction.\nThe spleen is a mobile organ although it normally does not descend inferior\nto the costal (rib) region; it rests on the left colic flexure (Fig. 5.58A, B). It is\nassociated posteriorly with the left 9th\u201311th ribs (its long axis is roughly parallel\nto the 10th rib) and separated from them by the diaphragm and the\ncostodiaphragmatic recess\u2014the cleft-like extension of the pleural cavity\nbetween the diaphragm and the lower part of the thoracic cage. The relations of\nthe spleen are as follows:\nAnteriorly, the stomach.\nPosteriorly, the left part of the diaphragm, which separates it from the pleura,\nlung, and ribs 9\u201311.\nInferiorly, the left colic flexure.\nMedially, the left kidney.\nThe spleen varies considerably in size, weight, and shape; however, it is\nusually approximately 12 cm long and 7 cm wide. (A nonmetric memory device\nexploits odd numbers: the spleen is 1 inch thick, 3 inches wide, 5 inches long,\nand weighs 7 ounces.)\nThe diaphragmatic surface of the spleen is convexly curved to fit the\nconcavity of the diaphragm and curved bodies of the adjacent ribs (Fig.\n5.58A\u2013C). The close relationship of the spleen to the ribs that normally protect it\ncan be a detrimental one in the presence of rib fractures (see the Clinical Box\n\u201cRupture of Spleen,\u201d p. 505).

Normally, the spleen does not extend inferior\nto the left costal margin; thus, it is seldom palpable through the anterolateral\nabdominal wall unless it is enlarged. When it is hardened and enlarged to\napproximately three times its normal size, it moves inferior to the left costal\nmargin, and its superior (notched) border lies inferomedially (see the Clinical\nBox \u201cSplenectomy and Splenomegaly,\u201d p. 505). The notched border is helpful\nwhen palpating an enlarged spleen because, when the person takes a deep breath,\nthe notches can often be palpated.\nThe spleen normally contains a large quantity of blood that is expelled\nperiodically into the circulation by the action of the smooth muscle in its capsule\nand trabeculae. The large size of the splenic artery (or vein) indicates the volume\nof blood that passes through the spleen\u2019s capillaries and sinuses. The thin\nfibrous capsule of the spleen is composed of dense, irregular, fibroelastic\nconnective tissue that is thickened at the splenic hilum (Fig. 5.58E). Internally,\nthe trabeculae (small fibrous bands), arising from the deep aspect of the capsule,\ncarry blood vessels to and from the parenchyma or splenic pulp, the substance\nof the spleen.\nThe spleen contacts the posterior wall of the stomach and is connected to its\ngreater curvature by the gastrosplenic ligament and to the left kidney by the\nsplenorenal ligament. These ligaments, containing splenic vessels, are attached\nto the hilum of the spleen on its medial aspect (Fig. 5.58D). The splenic hilum is\noften in contact with the tail of the pancreas and constitutes the left boundary of\nthe omental bursa.\nThe arterial supply of the spleen is from the splenic artery, the largest\nbranch of the celiac trunk (Fig. 5.59A). It follows a tortuous course posterior to\nthe omental bursa, anterior to the left kidney, and along the superior border of\nthe pancreas. Between the layers of the splenorenal ligament, the splenic artery\ndivides into five or more branches that enter the hilum. The lack of anastomosis\nof these arterial vessels within the spleen results in the formation of vascular\nsegments of the spleen: two in 84% of spleens and three in the others, with\nrelatively avascular planes between them, enabling subtotal splenectomy (see the\nClinical Box \u201cSplenectomy and Splenomegaly,\u201d p. 505).\n1147"

The anterior surface of the neck, covered with peritoneum, is adjacent to the\npylorus of the stomach. The SMV joins the splenic vein posterior to the neck to\nform the hepatic portal vein (Fig. 5.60).\nThe body of the pancreas continues from the neck and lies to the left of the\nsuperior mesenteric vessels, passing over the aorta and L2 vertebra, continuing\njust above the transpyloric plane posterior to the omental bursa. The anterior\nsurface of the body of the pancreas is covered with peritoneum and lies in the\nfloor of the omental bursa and forms part of the stomach bed (see Fig. 5.39A, B).\nThe posterior surface of the body is devoid of peritoneum and is in contact with\nthe aorta, SMA, left suprarenal gland, left kidney, and renal vessels (Fig. 5.59A).\nThe tail of the pancreas lies anterior to the left kidney, where it is closely\nrelated to the splenic hilum and the left colic flexure. The tail is relatively mobile\nand passes between the layers of the splenorenal ligament with the splenic\nvessels (Fig. 5.58D).\nThe main pancreatic duct begins in the tail of the pancreas and runs\nthrough the parenchyma of the gland to the pancreatic head: here it turns\ninferiorly and is closely related to the bile duct (Fig. 5.59A, B). The main\npancreatic duct and bile duct usually unite to form the short, dilated\nhepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater), which opens into the descending part of\nthe duodenum at the summit of the major duodenal papilla (Fig. 5.59B, C).

In such cases, the accessory duct carries most of the pancreatic juice.\nThe arterial supply of the pancreas is derived mainly from the branches of\nthe markedly tortuous splenic artery. Multiple pancreatic arteries form several\narcades with pancreatic branches of the gastroduodenal and superior mesenteric\narteries (Fig. 5.60A). As many as 10 branches may pass from the splenic artery\nto the body and tail of the pancreas. The anterior and posterior superior\npancreaticoduodenal arteries, branches of the gastroduodenal artery, and the\nanterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, branches of the\nSMA, form anteriorly and posteriorly placed arcades that supply the head of the\npancreas.\nVenous drainage from the pancreas occurs via corresponding pancreatic\nveins, tributaries of the splenic and superior mesenteric parts of the hepatic portal\nvein; most empty into the splenic vein (Fig. 5.60B).\nThe pancreatic lymphatic vessels follow the blood vessels (Figs. 5.46,\n5.61A, and 5.71). Most vessels end in the pancreaticosplenic lymph nodes,\nwhich lie along the splenic artery. Some vessels end in the pyloric lymph nodes.\nEfferent vessels from these nodes drain to the superior mesenteric lymph nodes\nor to the celiac lymph nodes via the hepatic lymph nodes.\nThe nerves of the pancreas are derived from the vagus and abdominopelvic\nsplanchnic nerves passing through the diaphragm (Fig. 5.61B). The\nparasympathetic and sympathetic fibers reach the pancreas by passing along the\narteries from the celiac plexus and superior mesenteric plexus (see also\n\u201cSummary of Innervation of Abdominal Viscera,\u201d p. 527). In addition to\nsympathetic fibers that pass to blood vessels, sympathetic and parasympathetic\nfibers are distributed to pancreatic acinar cells and islets.

Although\ncommonly said to be the anatomical units of the liver, hepatic \u201clobules\u201d are not\nstructural entities; instead, the lobular pattern is a physiological consequence of\npressure gradients and is altered by disease. Because the bile duct is not central,\nthe hepatic lobule does not represent a functional unit like acini of other glands.\nHowever, the hepatic lobule is a firmly established concept and is useful for\ndescriptive purposes.\nThe hepatocytes secrete bile into the bile canaliculi formed between them.\nThe canaliculi drain into the small interlobular biliary ducts and then into large\ncollecting bile ducts of the intrahepatic portal triad, which merges to form the\nhepatic ducts (Fig. 5.69B). The right and left hepatic ducts drain the right and\nleft (parts of the) liver, respectively. Shortly after leaving the porta hepatis, these\nhepatic ducts unite to form the common hepatic duct, which is joined on the\nright side by the cystic duct to form the bile duct (part of the extrahepatic portal\ntriad of the lesser omentum), which conveys the bile to the duodenum.\nBILE DUCT\nThe bile duct (formerly called the common bile duct) forms in the free edge of\nthe lesser omentum by the union of the cystic duct and common hepatic duct\n(Figs. 5.65 and 5.69B).

On the left\nside of the descending part of the duodenum, the bile duct comes into contact\nwith the main pancreatic duct. These ducts run obliquely through the wall of this\npart of the duodenum, where they unite, forming a dilation, the hepatopancreatic\nampulla (Fig. 5.69C). The distal end of the ampulla opens into the duodenum\nthrough the major duodenal papilla (see Fig. 5.45C). The circular muscle around\nthe distal end of the bile duct is thickened to form the sphincter of the bile duct\n(L. ductus choledochus) (Fig. 5.69C).

The mucosa of the neck spirals into the\nspiral fold (spiral valve) (Fig. 5.69B). The spiral fold helps keep the cystic duct\nopen; thus, bile can easily be diverted into the gallbladder when the distal end of\nthe bile duct is closed by the sphincter of the bile duct and/or hepatopancreatic\nsphincter, or bile can pass to the duodenum as the gallbladder contracts. The\nspiral fold also offers additional resistance to sudden dumping of bile when the\nsphincters are closed, and intra-abdominal pressure is suddenly increased, as\nduring a sneeze or cough. The cystic duct passes between the layers of the lesser\nomentum, usually parallel to the common hepatic duct, which it joins to form the\nbile duct.\nThe arterial supply of the gallbladder and cystic duct is from the cystic\nartery (Figs. 5.71, 5.72, and 5.74A). The cystic artery commonly arises from the\nright hepatic artery in the triangle between the common hepatic duct, cystic duct,\nand visceral surface of the liver, the cystohepatic triangle (of Calot) (Fig. 5.72).\nVariations occur in the origin and course of the cystic artery (Fig. 5.74B, C).\n1179"

These small and usually multiple veins enter the liver\ndirectly or drain through the hepatic portal vein to the liver, after joining the\nveins draining the hepatic ducts and proximal bile duct (Fig. 5.72). The veins\nfrom the fundus and body of the gallbladder pass directly into the visceral\nsurface of the liver and drain into the hepatic sinusoids. Because this is drainage\nfrom one capillary (sinusoidal) bed to another, it constitutes an additional\n(parallel) portal system.\nThe lymphatic drainage of the gallbladder is to the hepatic lymph nodes\n(Fig. 5.71), often through cystic lymph nodes located near the neck of the\ngallbladder. Efferent lymphatic vessels from these nodes pass to the celiac lymph\nnodes.\nThe nerves to the gallbladder and cystic duct (Fig. 5.72) pass along the\ncystic artery from the celiac (nerve) plexus (sympathetic and visceral afferent\n[pain] fibers) and the vagus nerve (parasympathetic).

Consequently, it is not\npalpable and is well protected from all but the most severe penetrating trauma.\nThe pancreas, like the liver, has a considerable functional reserve. For all these\nreasons, the pancreas, as an exocrine organ, is not commonly a primary cause of\nclinical problems (discounting diabetes, an endocrine disorder of the islet cells).\nMost exocrine pancreatic problems are secondary to biliary problems.\nPancreatic injury can result from sudden, severe, forceful compression of the\nabdomen, such as the force of impalement on a steering wheel in an automobile\naccident. Because the pancreas lies transversely, the vertebral column acts as an\nanvil, and the traumatic force may rupture the friable pancreas.\nRupture of the pancreas frequently tears its duct system, allowing pancreatic\njuice to enter the parenchyma of the gland and to invade adjacent tissues.\nDigestion of pancreatic and other tissues by pancreatic juice is very painful.\n Subtotal Pancreatectomy\nPancreatectomy, partial or complete surgical removal of the pancreas, is most\ncommonly performed when pancreatic tumors are detected (see \u201cPancreatic\nCancer\u201d below). However, subtotal or partial pancreatectomy is utilized to\nremove ruptured portions of the pancreas and for the treatment of chronic\npancreatitis after nonsurgical options have failed. Pancreatitis is a disease in\nwhich the pancreas becomes inflamed. Pancreatic damage happens when the\ndigestive enzymes are activated before they are released into the small intestine\nand begin attacking the pancreas.

The\nposterolateral abdominal wall has been incised between the\nmuscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall and the muscles of\nthe back. The kidney and perinephric fat surrounding it inside\nthe renal fascia are exposed. See Figure. 5.95A for an earlier\nstage of this dissection. B. This transverse section of the kidney\nshows the relationships of the muscles and fascia. Because the\nrenal fascia surrounds the kidney as a separate sheath, it must be\nincised in any surgical operation on the kidney, whether from an\nanterior or a posterior approach.\nThe collagen bundles, renal fascia, and perinephric and paranephric fat,\nalong with the tethering provided by the renal vessels and ureter, hold the\nkidneys in a relatively fixed position. However, movement of the kidneys occurs\nduring respiration and when changing from the supine to the erect position, and\nvice versa. Normal renal mobility is approximately 3 cm, approximately the\nheight of one vertebral body. Superiorly, the renal fascia is continuous with the\nfascia on the inferior surface of the diaphragm (diaphragmatic fascia); thus, the\nprimary attachment of the suprarenal glands is to the diaphragm. Inferiorly, the\nanterior and posterior layers of renal fascia are only loosely united, if attached at\nall. (See the Clinical Boxes \u201cPerinephric Abscess\u201d and \u201cNephroptosis,\u201d p. 523.)\nKIDNEYS\nThe ovoid kidneys remove excess water, salts, and wastes of protein metabolism\nfrom the blood while returning nutrients and chemicals to the blood.

The renal hilum is the entrance to a space within\nthe kidney, the renal sinus. Structures that serve the kidneys (vessels, nerves,\nand structures that drain urine from the kidney) enter and exit the renal sinus\nthrough the renal hilum. The hilum of the left kidney lies near the transpyloric\nplane, approximately 5 cm from the median plane (Fig. 5.78).

They run\ninferiorly from the apices of the renal pelves at the hila of the kidneys, passing\nover the pelvic brim at the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries.

From the back, the surface\nmarking of the ureter is a line joining a point 5 cm lateral to the L1 spinous\nprocess and the posterior superior iliac spine (Fig. 5.78). The ureters occupy a\nsagittal plane that intersects the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar\nvertebrae. When examining the ureters radiographically using contrast medium\n(Figs. 5.81 and 5.82), the ureters normally demonstrate relative constrictions in\nthree places: (1) at the junction of the ureters and renal pelves, (2) where the\nureters cross the brim of the pelvic inlet, and (3) during their passage through the\nwall of the urinary bladder (Fig. 5.82).

The\npyramidal right gland is more apical (situated over the superior pole) relative to\nthe left kidney, lies anterolateral to the right crus of the diaphragm, and makes\ncontact with the IVC anteromedially (Fig. 5.79) and the liver anterolaterally. The\ncrescent-shaped left gland is medial to the superior half of the left kidney and is\nrelated to the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and the left crus of the diaphragm.\nEach gland has a hilum, where the veins and lymphatic vessels exit the\ngland, whereas the arteries and nerves enter the glands at multiple sites. The\nmedial borders of the suprarenal glands are 4\u20135 cm apart. In this area, from right\nto left, are the IVC, right crus of the diaphragm, celiac ganglion, celiac trunk,\nSMA, and the left crus of the diaphragm.\nEach suprarenal gland has two parts: the suprarenal cortex and suprarenal\nmedulla (Fig. 5.83, inset); these parts have different embryological origins and\ndifferent functions.\nThe suprarenal cortex derives from mesoderm and secretes corticosteroids\nand androgens. These hormones cause the kidneys to retain sodium and water in\nresponse to stress, increasing the blood volume and blood pressure. They also\naffect muscles and organs such as the heart and lungs.\nThe suprarenal medulla is a mass of nervous tissue permeated with\ncapillaries and sinusoids that derives from neural crest cells associated with the\nsympathetic nervous system (see Fig. 5.87). The chromaffin cells of the medulla\nare related to sympathetic ganglion (postsynaptic) neurons in both derivation\n(neural crest cells) and function. These cells secrete catecholamines (mostly\nepinephrine) into the bloodstream in response to signals from presynaptic\nneurons. Powerful medullary hormones, epinephrine (adrenaline) and\nnorepinephrine (noradrenaline), activate the body to a flight-or-fight status in\nresponse to traumatic stress.

Symptoms of intermittent pain in\nthe renal region, relieved by lying down, appear to result from traction on the\nrenal vessels. The lack of inferior support for the kidneys in the lumbar region is\none of the reasons transplanted kidneys are placed in the iliac fossa of the\ngreater pelvis. Other reasons for this placement are the availability of major\nblood vessels and convenient access to the nearby bladder.\n Renal Transplantation\nRenal transplantation is the preferred treatment for selected cases of chronic\nrenal failure.

The median root\nis a branch of the celiac plexus, and the lateral roots arise from the lesser and\nleast splanchnic nerves, sometimes with a contribution from the first lumbar\nganglion of the sympathetic trunk.\nThe inferior mesenteric plexus surrounds the inferior mesenteric artery and\ngives offshoots to its branches. It receives a medial root from the intermesenteric\nplexus and lateral roots from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic trunks. An\ninferior mesenteric ganglion may also appear just superior to the root of the\ninferior mesenteric artery.\nThe intermesenteric plexus is part of the aortic plexus of nerves between\nthe superior and the inferior mesenteric arteries. It gives rise to renal, testicular\nor ovarian, and ureteric plexuses.\nThe superior hypogastric plexus is continuous with the intermesenteric\nplexus and the inferior mesenteric plexus and lies anterior to the inferior part of\nthe abdominal aorta and extends inferiorly across its bifurcation (Table 5.11).\nRight and left hypogastric nerves join the superior hypogastric plexus to the\ninferior hypogastric plexus. The superior hypogastric plexus supplies ureteric\nand testicular plexuses and a plexus on each common iliac artery.\nThe inferior hypogastric plexuses are mixed sympathetic and\nparasympathetic plexuses formed on each side as the hypogastric nerves from\nthe superior hypogastric plexus merge with the pelvic splanchnic nerves. The\nright and left plexuses are situated on the sides of the rectum, cervix of the\nuterus, and urinary bladder. The plexuses receive small branches from the\nsuperior sacral sympathetic ganglia and the sacral parasympathetic outflow from\nS2 through S4 sacral spinal nerves (pelvic [parasympathetic] splanchnic nerves).\nExtensions of the inferior hypogastric plexus send autonomic fibers along the\nblood vessels, which form visceral plexuses on the walls of the pelvic viscera\n(e.g., rectal and vesical plexuses).\nINTRINSIC PLEXUSES: THE ENTERIC NERVOUS\nSYSTEM\nIntrinsic ganglionated plexuses of the GI tract, extending from the midesophagus\nthrough the internal anal sphincter and along the pancreatobiliary duct system,\nconstitute the enteric nervous system (ENS).

The fascia lining the posterior abdominal wall is continuous with\nthe transversalis fascia that lines the transversus abdominis muscle. It is\ncustomary to name the fascia according to the structure it covers.\nThe psoas fascia covering the psoas major muscle (psoas sheath) is attached\nmedially to the lumbar vertebrae and pelvic brim. The psoas fascia (sheath) is\nthickened superiorly to form the medial arcuate ligament (Fig. 5.92). The psoas\nfascia fuses laterally with the quadratus lumborum and thoracolumbar fascias\n(Fig. 5.96B). Inferior to the iliac crest, the psoas fascia is continuous with the\npart of the iliac fascia covering the iliacus.\nThe thoracolumbar fascia is an extensive fascial complex attached to the\nvertebral column medially that, in the lumbar region, has posterior, middle, and\nanterior layers with muscles enclosed between them (Fig. 5.96B, C). It is thin\nand transparent where it covers the thoracic parts of the deep muscles, but it is\nthick and strong in the lumbar region. The enclosure of the vertical deep back\nmuscles (erector spinae) by the posterior and middle layers of the thoracolumbar\nfascia on the posterior aspect of the trunk is comparable to the enclosure of the\nrectus abdominis by the rectus sheath on the anterior aspect (Fig. 5.96A). This\nposterior sheath is even more formidable than the rectus sheath, however,\nbecause of the thickness of its posterior layer and the central attachment to the\nlumbar vertebrae, as opposed to the rectus sheaths, which lack bony support\nwhere they fuse to each other at the linea alba. The lumbar part of this posterior\nsheath, extending between the 12th rib and the iliac crest, attaches laterally to the\ninternal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, as does the rectus sheath.\nHowever, in contrast to the rectus sheath, the thoracolumbar fascia is not\nattached to the external oblique; it is attached to the latissimus dorsi (Fig. 5.96B,\nC).\n1264"

The IVC, the largest vein in the body, has no\nvalves except for a variable, nonfunctional one at its orifice in the right atrium of\nthe heart. The IVC returns poorly oxygenated blood from the lower limbs, most\nof the back, the abdominal walls, and the abdominopelvic viscera. Blood from\nthe abdominal viscera passes through the portal venous system and the liver\nbefore entering the IVC via the hepatic veins.\nThe inferior vena cava (IVC) begins anterior to the L5 vertebra by the\nunion of the common iliac veins. The union occurs approximately 2.5 cm to the\nright of the median plane, inferior to the aortic bifurcation and posterior to the\nproximal part of the right common iliac artery (see Fig. 5.76). The IVC ascends\non the right side of the bodies of the L3\u2013L5 vertebrae and on the right psoas\nmajor to the right of the aorta. The IVC leaves the abdomen by passing through\nthe caval opening in the diaphragm and enters the thorax at the T8 vertebral\nlevel. Because it is formed one vertebral level inferior to the aortic bifurcation,\nand traverses the diaphragm four vertebral levels superior to the aortic hiatus, the\noverall length of the IVC is 7 cm greater than that of the abdominal aorta,\nalthough most of the additional length is intrahepatic. The IVC collects poorly\noxygenated blood from the lower limbs and nonportal blood from the abdomen\nand pelvis. Almost all the blood from the gastrointestinal tract is collected by the\nhepatic portal system and passes through the hepatic veins to the IVC.\nThe tributaries of the IVC correspond to the paired visceral and parietal\nbranches of the abdominal aorta.

Pain\nresulting from irritation of the diaphragmatic pleura or the diaphragmatic\nperitoneum is referred to the shoulder region, the area of skin supplied by the\nC3\u2013C5 segments of the spinal cord (see the Clinical Box \u201cVisceral Referred\nPain\u201d earlier in this chapter). These segments also contribute anterior rami to\nthe phrenic nerves. Irritation of peripheral regions of the diaphragm, innervated\nby the inferior intercostal nerves, is more localized, being referred to the skin\nover the costal margins of the anterolateral abdominal wall.\n1275"

The\ncommon cause of this injury is severe trauma to the thorax or abdomen during a\nmotor vehicle accident. Most diaphragmatic ruptures are on the left side (95%)\nbecause the substantial mass of the liver, intimately associated with the\ndiaphragm on the right side, provides a physical barrier.\nA nonmuscular area of variable size called the lumbocostal triangle usually\noccurs between the costal and lumbar parts of the diaphragm (see Figs. 5.92 and\n5.98). This part of the diaphragm is normally formed only by fusion of the\nsuperior and inferior fascias of the diaphragm. When a traumatic diaphragmatic\nhernia occurs, the stomach, small intestine and mesentery, transverse colon, and\nspleen may herniate through this area into the thorax.\nHiatal (hiatus) hernia, a protrusion of part of the stomach into the thorax\nthrough the esophageal hiatus, was discussed earlier in this chapter. The\nstructures that pass through the esophageal hiatus (vagal trunks, left inferior\nphrenic vessels, esophageal branches of the left gastric vessels) may be injured\nin surgical procedures on the esophageal hiatus (e.g., repair of a hiatus hernia).\n Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia\nIn congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), part of the stomach and intestine\nherniate through a large posterolateral defect (foramen of Bochdalek) in the\nregion of the lumbocostal trigone of the diaphragm (Fig. B5.37). Herniation\nalmost always occurs on the left owing to the presence of the liver on the right.\nThis type of hernia results from the complex development of the diaphragm.\nPosterolateral defect of the diaphragm is the only relatively common congenital\nanomaly of the diaphragm, occurring approximately once in 2,200 newborn\ninfants (Moore, Persaud, and Torchia, 2016).

TB of the vertebral\ncolumn is quite common. An infection may spread through the blood to the\nvertebrae (hematogenous spread), particularly during childhood. An abscess\nresulting from tuberculosis in the lumbar region tends to spread from the\nvertebrae into the psoas fascia (sheath), where it produces a psoas abscess (Fig.\nB5.38). As a consequence, the psoas fascia thickens to form a strong stocking-\nlike tube.

Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in\nadvanced stages invades the muscles and nerves of the posterior abdominal\nwall, producing excruciating pain because of the close relationship of the\npancreas to the posterior abdominal wall.\n Partial Lumbar Sympathectomy\nThe treatment of some patients with arterial disease in the lower limbs may\ninclude a partial lumbar sympathectomy, the surgical removal of two or more\nlumbar sympathetic ganglia by division of their rami communicantes. Surgical\naccess to the sympathetic trunks is commonly through a lateral extraperitoneal\napproach because the sympathetic trunks lie retroperitoneally in the\nextraperitoneal fatty tissue (see Fig. 5.98). The surgeon splits the muscles of the\nanterior abdominal wall and moves the peritoneum medially and anteriorly to\nexpose the medial edge of the psoas major, along which the sympathetic trunk\nlies. The left trunk is often overlapped slightly by the aorta. The right\nsympathetic trunk is covered by the IVC. The intimate relationship of the\nsympathetic trunks to the aorta and IVC also makes these large vessels\nvulnerable to injury during lumbar sympathectomy. Consequently, the surgeon\ncarefully retracts them to expose the sympathetic trunks that usually lie in the\ngroove between the psoas major laterally and the lumbar vertebral bodies\nmedially. These trunks are often obscured by fat and lymphatic tissue.

The pelvic cavity is the inferiormost part of the\nabdominopelvic cavity. Anatomically, the pelvis is the part of the body\nsurrounded by the pelvic girdle (bony pelvis), part of the appendicular skeleton\nof the lower limb (Fig. 6.1).\nFIGURE 6.1. Pelvis and perineum. A, B. The pelvis (green) is\nthe space within the pelvic girdle, overlapped externally by the\nabdominal and gluteal regions, perineum, and lower back.\nConsequently, the pelvis has no external surface area. The\ngreater pelvis (light green) is pelvic by virtue of its bony\nboundaries but is abdominal in terms of its contents. The lesser\npelvis (dark green) provides the bony framework (skeleton) for\nthe pelvic cavity and deep perineum.\nThe pelvis is subdivided into greater and lesser pelves. The greater pelvis is\nsurrounded by the superior pelvic girdle. The greater pelvis is occupied by\ninferior abdominal viscera, affording them protection similar to the way the\nsuperior abdominal viscera are protected by the inferior thoracic cage. The lesser\npelvis is surrounded by the inferior pelvic girdle, which provides the skeletal\nframework for both the pelvic cavity and the perineum\u2014compartments of the\ntrunk separated by the musculofascial pelvic diaphragm. Externally, the pelvis is\ncovered or overlapped by the inferior anterolateral abdominal wall anteriorly, the\ngluteal region of the lower limb posterolaterally, and the perineum inferiorly.\n1295"

The perineum includes the anus and external genitalia: the\npenis and scrotum of the male and the vulva of the female.\n1The term perineum has been used in different ways, in different languages, and\nin different circumstances. In its most restricted sense, and in obstetrics, it has\nbeen used to refer to the area superficial to the perineal body, between the vulva\nor scrotum and the anus or to the perineal body itself. In an intermediate sense, it\nhas included only the perineal region, a superficial (surface) area bounded by the\nthighs laterally, the mons pubis anteriorly, and the coccyx posteriorly. In its\nwidest sense, as used in Terminologia Anatomica (the international anatomical\nterminology), and in this book, it refers to the region of the body that includes all\nstructures of the anal and urogenital triangles, superficial and deep, extending as\nfar superiorly as the inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm.\nPELVIC GIRDLE\nThe pelvic girdle is a basin-shaped ring of bones that connects the vertebral\ncolumn to the two femurs. The primary functions of the pelvic girdle are to\nbear the weight of the upper body when sitting and standing.\ntransfer that weight from the axial to the lower appendicular skeleton for\nstanding and walking.\nprovide attachment for the powerful muscles of locomotion and posture and\nthose of the abdominal wall, withstanding the forces generated by their\nactions.\nConsequently, the pelvic girdle is strong and rigid, especially compared to\nthe pectoral (shoulder) girdle. Other functions of the pelvic girdle are to\ncontain and protect the pelvic viscera (inferior parts of the urinary tracts and\nthe internal reproductive organs) and the inferior abdominal viscera (e.g.,\nintestines), while permitting passage of their terminal parts (and, in females,\na full-term fetus) via the perineum.\nprovide support for the abdominopelvic viscera and gravid (pregnant) uterus.\n1296"

The terms pelvis, lesser pelvis, and\npelvic cavity are commonly used incorrectly, as if they were synonymous terms.\nOrientation of Pelvic Girdle\nWhen a person is in the anatomical position, the right and left anterior superior\niliac spines (ASISs) and the anterior aspect of the pubic symphysis lie in the\nsame vertical plane (Fig. 6.2B, C). When a pelvic girdle in this position is\nviewed anteriorly (Fig. 6.2A), the tip of the coccyx appears close to the center of\nthe pelvic inlet, and the pubic bones and pubic symphysis constitute more of a\nweight-bearing floor than an anterior wall.

Consequently, the curved axis of the pelvis intersects\nthe axis of the abdominal cavity at an oblique angle.\nPelvic Girdle Sexual Differences\nDistinction between male and female skeletons is most evident in the pelvic\ngirdle. The pelvic girdles of males and females differ in several respects (Fig.\n6.3; Table 6.1).

The\niliolumbar ligaments are accessory ligaments to this mechanism (Fig. 6.6).\nInferiorly, the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments are joined by fibers extending\nfrom the posterior margin of the ilium (between the posterior superior and\nposterior inferior iliac spines) and the base of the coccyx to form the massive\nsacrotuberous ligament (Fig. 6.6). This ligament passes from the posterior ilium\nand lateral sacrum and coccyx to the ischial tuberosity, transforming the sciatic\nnotch of the hip bone into a large sciatic foramen. The sacrospinous ligament,\npassing from the lateral sacrum and coccyx to the ischial spine, further\nsubdivides this foramen into greater and lesser sciatic foramina.\nUsually, movement at the sacro-iliac joint is limited by interlocking of the\narticulating bones and the sacro-iliac ligaments to slight gliding and rotary\nmovements (Fig. 6.5D). When landing after a high jump or when weight lifting\nin the standing position, exceptional force is transmitted through the bodies of\nthe lumbar vertebrae to the superior end of the sacrum. Because this transfer of\nweight occurs anterior to the axis of the sacro-iliac joints, the superior end of the\nsacrum is pushed inferiorly and anteriorly. However, rotation of the superior\nsacrum is counterbalanced by the strong sacrotuberous and sacrospinous\nligaments, which anchor the inferior end of the sacrum to the ischium,\npreventing its superior and posterior rotation (Figs. 6.5D and 6.6). By allowing\nonly slight upward movement of the inferior end of the sacrum relative to the hip\nbones, resilience is provided to the sacro-iliac region when the vertebral column\nsustains sudden increases in force or weight.\nPUBIC SYMPHYSIS\nThe pubic symphysis consists of a fibrocartilaginous interpubic disc and\nsurrounding ligaments uniting the bodies of the pubic bones in the median plane\n(Fig. 6.7).

This change increases the circumference of the lesser pelvis\nand contributes to increased flexibility of the pubic symphysis. Increased levels\nof sex hormones and the presence of the hormone relaxin cause the pelvic\nligaments to relax during the latter half of pregnancy, allowing increased\nmovement at the pelvic joints. Relaxation of the sacro-iliac joints and pubic\nsymphysis permits as much as a 10\u201315% increase in diameters (mostly\ntransverse, including the interspinous distance; Fig. B6.2A), facilitating passage\nof the fetus through the pelvic canal. The coccyx is also able to move\nposteriorly.\nThe one diameter that remains unaffected is the true (obstetrical) diameter\nbetween the sacral promontory and the posterosuperior aspect of the pubic\nsymphysis (Fig. B6.2A, B). Relaxation of sacro-iliac ligaments causes the\ninterlocking mechanism of the sacro-iliac joint to become less effective,\npermitting greater rotation of the pelvis and contributing to the lordotic (hollow\nback, saddle back) posture often assumed during pregnancy with the change in\nthe center of gravity. Relaxation of ligaments is not limited to the pelvis, and\nthe possibility of joint dislocation increases during late pregnancy.\nSpondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis\nSpondylolysis is a defect allowing part of a vertebral arch (the posterior\nprojection from the vertebral body that surrounds the spinal canal and bears the\narticular, transverse, and spinal processes) to be separated from its body.\nSpondylolysis of vertebra L5 results in the separation of the vertebral body from\nthe part of its vertebral arch bearing the inferior articular processes (Fig.\nB6.4A).

Active contraction of the (voluntary)\npuborectalis portion is important in maintaining fecal continence immediately\nafter rectal filling or during peristalsis when the rectum is full and the\ninvoluntary sphincter muscle is inhibited (relaxed).\nThe levator ani must relax to allow urination and defecation. The increased\nintra-abdominal pressure for defecation is provided by contraction of the\n(thoracic) diaphragm and muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall. Acting\ntogether, the parts of the levator ani elevate the pelvic floor after their relaxation\nand the consequent descent of the pelvic diaphragm that occurs during urination\nand defecation.\nPeritoneum and Peritoneal Cavity of Pelvis\nThe parietal peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity continues inferiorly into the\npelvic cavity but does not reach the pelvic floor. Instead, it reflects onto the\npelvic viscera, remaining separated from the pelvic floor by the pelvic viscera\nand surrounding pelvic fascia (Table 6.3). The pelvic viscera are not completely\nensheathed by peritoneum, lying inferior to it for the main part. Only their\nsuperior and superolateral surfaces are covered with peritoneum. Only the\nuterine tubes (except for their ostia, which are open) are intraperitoneal and\nsuspended by a mesentery. The ovaries, although suspended in the peritoneal\ncavity by a mesentery, are not covered with glistening peritoneum; instead, a\nspecial, relatively dull epithelium of cuboidal cells (germinal epithelium) covers\nthem.\nTABLE 6.3.

The\nperitoneum passes over the fundus of the uterus and descends the entire posterior\naspect of the uterus onto the posterior vaginal wall before reflecting superiorly\nonto the anterior wall of the inferior rectum (rectal ampulla). The \u201cpocket\u201d thus\nformed between the uterus and the rectum is the recto-uterine pouch (cul-de-\nsac of Douglas) (6 in Table 6.3C). The median recto-uterine pouch is often\ndescribed as being the inferiormost extent of the peritoneal cavity in the female,\nbut often, its lateral extensions on each side of the rectum, the pararectal fossae,\nare deeper.\nProminent peritoneal ridges, the recto-uterine folds, formed by underlying\nfascial ligaments demarcate the lateral boundaries of the pararectal fossae (Table\n6.3A). As the peritoneum passes up and over the uterus in the middle of the\npelvic cavity, a double peritoneal fold, the broad ligament of the uterus, extends\nbetween the uterus and the lateral pelvic wall on each side, forming a partition\nthat separates the paravesical fossae and pararectal fossae of each side. The\nuterine tubes, ovaries, ligaments of the ovaries, and round ligaments of the uterus\nare enclosed within the broad ligaments. Subdivisions of the broad ligament\nrelated to these structures are discussed with the uterus later in this chapter.\nRecall that in females, the pelvic peritoneal cavity communicates with the\nexternal environment via the uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina.\nIn males\u2014and in females who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the\nuterus)\u2014the central peritoneum descends a short distance (as much as 2 cm)\ndown the posterior surface (base) of the bladder and then reflects superiorly onto\nthe anterior surface of the inferior rectum, forming the rectovesical pouch. The\nfemale recto-uterine pouch is normally deeper (extends farther caudally) than the\nmale rectovesical pouch (7 in Table 6.3).\nIn males, a gentle peritoneal fold or ridge, the ureteric fold, is formed as the\nperitoneum passes up and over the ureter and ductus (vas) deferens (secretory\nduct of the testis) on each side of the posterior bladder, separating the paravesical\nand pararectal fossae (see Fig. 6.30). In this regard, it is the male equivalent of\nthe broad ligament of the uterus. Posterior to the ureteric folds and lateral to the\ncentral rectovesical pouch, the peritoneum often descends far enough caudally to\ncover the superior ends or superior posterior surfaces of the seminal glands\n1329"

Since\nthe posterior part of the urinary bladder rests on the anterior wall\nof the vagina, the paracolpium supports the vagina and\ncontributes to the support of the bladder.\nENDOPELVIC FASCIA: LOOSE AND CONDENSED\nOften, the abundant connective tissue remaining between the parietal and\nvisceral membranous layers is considered to be part of the visceral fascia, but\nsometimes, it is labeled as parietal fascia. It is probably more realistic to consider\nthis remaining fascia simply as extraperitoneal or subperitoneal endopelvic\nfascia (Fig. 6.13A, C), which lies adjacent to both the parietal and visceral\nmembranous fascias. This fascia forms a connective tissue matrix or packing\nmaterial for the pelvic viscera (Fig. 6.13B, D). It varies markedly in density and\ncontent. Some of it is an extremely loose areolar (fatty) tissue, relatively devoid\nof all but minor lymphatics and nutrient vessels. During dissection or surgery,\nthe fingers can be pushed into this loose tissue with ease, creating actual spaces\nby blunt dissection, for example, between the pubis and bladder anteriorly and\nbetween the sacrum and rectum posteriorly. These potential spaces, normally\nconsisting only of a layer of loose fatty tissue, are the retropubic (or prevesical,\nextended posterolaterally as paravesical) and retrorectal (or presacral) spaces,\nrespectively. The presence of loose connective tissue here accommodates the\nexpansion of the urinary bladder and rectal ampulla as they fill.\nAlthough types of endopelvic fascia do not differ much in their gross\nappearance, other parts of the endopelvic fascia have a much more fibrous\nconsistency, containing an abundance of collagen and elastic fibers and a\nscattering of smooth muscle fibers. These parts are often described as \u201cfascial\ncondensations\u201d or pelvic \u201cligaments.\u201d For example, during dissection, if you\ninsert the fingers of one hand into the retropubic space and the fingers of the\nother hand into the presacral space and attempt to bring them together along the\nlateral pelvic wall, you will find that they do not meet or pass from one space to\nthe other.

It gives passage to essentially all the vessels\nand nerves passing from the lateral wall of the pelvis to the pelvic viscera, along\nwith the ureters and, in the male, the ductus deferens.\nAs it extends medially from the lateral wall, the hypogastric sheath divides\ninto three laminae (layers) that pass to or between the pelvic organs, conveying\nneurovascular structures and providing support. Because of the latter function,\nthey are also referred to as ligaments. The anteriormost lamina, the lateral\nligament of the bladder, passes to the bladder, conveying the superior vesical\narteries and veins. The posteriormost lamina (lateral rectal ligament) passes to\nthe rectum, conveying the middle rectal artery and vein.\nIn the male, the middle lamina forms a relatively thin fascial partition, the\nrectovesical septum (Fig. 6.13D), between the posterior surface of the bladder\nand the prostate anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. In the female, the middle\nlamina is markedly more substantial than the other two, passing medially to the\nuterine cervix and vagina as the cardinal ligament (transverse cervical\nligament) (Figs. 6.13B and 6.14A, B).\nIn its superiormost portion, at the base of the peritoneal broad ligament, the\nuterine artery runs medially toward the cervix while the ureters pass immediately\ninferior to them. The ureters pass on each side of the cervix heading anteriorly\ntoward the bladder. This relationship (\u201cwater passing under the bridge\u201d) is an\nespecially important one for surgeons (see the Clinical Box \u201cIatrogenic Injury of\nUreters\u201d). The cardinal ligament, and the way in which the uterus normally\n\u201crests\u201d on top of the bladder, provides the main passive support for the uterus.\nThe perineal muscles provide dynamic support for the uterus by contracting\nduring moments of increased intra-abdominal pressure (sneezing, coughing,\netc.). Passive and dynamic supports together resist the tendency for the uterus to\nfall or be pushed through the hollow tube formed by the vagina (uterine\nprolapse). The cardinal ligament has enough fibrous content to anchor wide\nloops of suture during surgical repairs.\nIn addition to the ischio-anal fossae inferior to the pelvic diaphragm (i.e., in\nthe perineum) (Fig. 6.13A, C), there is a surgically important potential\npelvirectal space in the loose extraperitoneal connective tissue superior to the\npelvic diaphragm (Fig. 6.13D).

These parts of the\nmuscle are important because they encircle and support the urethra, vagina, and\nanal canal. Weakening of the levator ani and pelvic fascia (e.g., tearing of the\nparacolpium), from stretching or tearing during childbirth, may decrease\nsupport for the vagina, bladder, uterus, or rectum or alter the position of the\nneck of the bladder and the urethra. These changes may cause urinary stress\nincontinence, characterized by dribbling of urine when intra-abdominal pressure\nis raised during coughing and lifting, for example, or lead to the prolapse of one\nor more pelvic organs (see the Clinical Boxes \u201cCystocele, Urethrocele, and\nUrinary Incontinence\u201d and \u201cPelvic Organ Prolapse\u201d).

Before birth, the umbilical arteries are the main\ncontinuation of the internal iliac arteries, passing along the lateral pelvic wall\nand then ascending the anterior abdominal wall to and through the umbilical ring\ninto the umbilical cord.\nPrenatally, the umbilical arteries conduct oxygen- and nutrient-deficient\nblood to the placenta for replenishment. When the umbilical cord is cut, the\ndistal parts of these vessels no longer function and become occluded distal to\nbranches that pass to the bladder. The occluded parts form fibrous cords, the\nmedial umbilical ligaments (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17A, B). The ligaments raise folds\nof peritoneum (medial umbilical folds) on the deep surface of the anterior\nabdominal wall (see Chapter 2, Back).\nPostnatally, the patent parts of the umbilical arteries run antero-inferiorly\nbetween the urinary bladder and the lateral wall of the pelvis.\nObturator Artery. The origin of the obturator artery is variable; usually, it\narises close to the origin of the umbilical artery, where it is crossed by the ureter.\nIt runs antero-inferiorly on the obturator fascia on the lateral wall of the pelvis\nand passes between the obturator nerve and vein (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17A, B).\nWithin the pelvis, the obturator artery gives off muscular branches, a nutrient\nartery to the ilium, and a pubic branch. The pubic branch arises just before the\nobturator artery leaves the pelvis. It ascends on the pelvic surface of the pubis to\nanastomose with its fellow of the opposite side and the pubic branch of the\ninferior epigastric artery, a branch of the external iliac artery.\nIn a common variation (20%), an aberrant or accessory obturator artery\narises from the inferior epigastric artery and descends into the pelvis along the\nusual route of the pubic branch (Figs. 6.15 and 6.16). Surgeons performing\nhernia repairs must keep this common variation in mind. The extrapelvic\ndistribution of the obturator artery is described with the lower limb (Chapter 7).\nInferior Vesical Artery. The inferior vesical artery occurs consistently\nonly in males (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17A). In females, it may occur\u2014with nearly\nequal frequency\u2014as a separate branch of the internal iliac artery or as a branch\nof the uterine artery (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17B).\nUterine Artery. The uterine artery is an additional branch of the internal\niliac artery in females, usually arising separately and directly from the internal\niliac artery (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17B). It may arise from the umbilical artery.\nDevelopmentally, it is the homolog of the artery to the ductus deferens in males.\nIt descends on the lateral wall of the pelvis, anterior to the internal iliac artery,\n1344"

The middle rectal artery may arise independently\nfrom the internal iliac artery, or it may arise in common with the inferior vesical\nartery or the internal pudendal artery (Figs. 6.16 and 6.17).\nInternal Pudendal Artery. The internal pudendal artery, larger in males\nthan in females, passes inferolaterally, anterior to the piriformis muscle and\nsacral plexus. It leaves the pelvis between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles\nby passing through the inferior part of the greater sciatic foramen. The internal\npudendal artery then passes around the posterior aspect of the ischial spine or the\nsacrospinous ligament and enters the ischio-anal fossa through the lesser sciatic\nforamen.\nThe internal pudendal artery, along with the internal pudendal veins and\nbranches of the pudendal nerve, passes through the pudendal canal in the lateral\nwall of the ischio-anal fossa (Fig. 6.11B). As it exits the canal, medial to the\nischial tuberosity, the internal pudendal artery divides into its terminal branches,\nthe perineal artery and dorsal arteries of the penis or clitoris.\nInferior Gluteal Artery. The inferior gluteal artery is the larger terminal\nbranch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery (Fig. 6.18A) but may\narise from the posterior division (Fig. 6.17). It passes posteriorly between the\nsacral nerves (usually S2 and S3) and leaves the pelvis through the inferior part\nof the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis muscle (Fig. 6.16). It\nsupplies the muscles and skin of the buttocks and the posterior surface of the\nthigh.\nPosterior Division of Internal Iliac Artery. When the internal iliac artery\ndivides into anterior and posterior divisions, the posterior division typically gives\nrise to the following three parietal arteries (Fig. 6.17A, B):\nIliolumbar artery: This artery runs superolaterally in a recurrent fashion\n(turning sharply backward relative to its source) to the iliac fossa. Within the\nfossa, the artery divides into an iliac branch, which supplies the iliacus\nmuscle and ilium, and a lumbar branch, which supplies the psoas major and\nquadratus lumborum muscles.\nLateral sacral arteries: Superior and inferior lateral sacral arteries may arise\nas independent branches or via a common trunk. The lateral sacral arteries\npass medially and descend anterior to the sacral anterior rami, giving off\nspinal branches, which pass through the anterior sacral foramina and supply\n1346"

As it\npasses inferiorly, the ovarian artery adheres to the parietal peritoneum and runs\nanterior to the ureter on the posterior abdominal wall, usually giving branches to\nit. As the ovarian artery enters the lesser pelvis, it crosses the origin of the\nexternal iliac vessels. It then runs medially, dividing into an ovarian branch and\na tubal branch, which supply the ovary and uterine tube, respectively (Fig.\n6.18B). These branches anastomose with the corresponding branches of the\nuterine artery.\nMEDIAN SACRAL ARTERY\nThe median sacral artery is a small unpaired artery that usually arises from the\nposterior surface of the abdominal aorta, just superior to its bifurcation, but it\nmay arise from its anterior surface (Fig. 6.16). This vessel descends in or near\nthe midline anterior to the bodies of the last one or two lumbar vertebrae and the\nsacrum and coccyx. During pelvic laparoscopic procedures, it provides a useful\nindication of the midline on the posterior wall of the pelvis. Its terminal branches\nparticipate in a series of anastomotic loops. Before the median sacral artery\nenters the lesser pelvis, it sometimes gives rise to a pair of L5 arteries.\nAs it descends over the sacrum, the median sacral artery gives off small\nparietal (lateral sacral) branches that anastomose with the lateral sacral arteries.\nIt also gives rise to small visceral branches to the posterior part of the rectum,\nwhich anastomose with the superior and middle rectal arteries. The median\nsacral artery represents the caudal end of the embryonic dorsal aorta, which\nreduced in size as the tail-like caudal eminence of the embryo disappeared.\nSUPERIOR RECTAL ARTERY\n1347"

These intercommunicating networks of veins are\nclinically important. The various plexuses within the lesser pelvis (rectal,\nvesical, prostatic, uterine, and vaginal) unite and are drained mainly by\ntributaries of the internal iliac veins, but some of them drain through the superior\nrectal vein into the inferior mesenteric vein of the hepatic portal system (Fig.\n6.19A) or through lateral sacral veins into the internal vertebral venous plexus\n(see Chapter 2, Back).

However, there are no veins accompanying the\numbilical arteries between the pelvis and the umbilicus, and the iliolumbar\nveins from the iliac fossae of the greater pelvis usually drain into the common\niliac veins instead.

In addition, subplexuses in the male are also associated\nwith the prostate and seminal glands. In females, subplexuses are also associated\nwith the cervix of the uterus and the lateral fornices of the vagina.\nPelvic splanchnic nerves arise in the pelvis from the anterior rami of spinal\nnerves S2\u2013S4 of the sacral plexus (Figs. 6.21\u20136.23). They convey presynaptic\nparasympathetic fibers derived from the S2\u2013S4 spinal cord segments, which\nmake up the sacral outflow of the parasympathetic (craniosacral) nervous\nsystem, and visceral afferent fibers from cell bodies in the spinal ganglia of the\ncorresponding spinal nerves. The greatest contribution of these fibers is usually\nfrom the S3 nerve.\nThe hypogastric/pelvic system of plexuses, receiving sympathetic fibers via\nlumbar splanchnic nerves and parasympathetic fibers via pelvic splanchnic\nnerves, innervate the pelvic viscera. Although the sympathetic component\nlargely produces vasomotion as elsewhere, here, it also inhibits peristaltic\ncontraction of the rectum and stimulates contraction of the internal genital\norgans during orgasm, producing ejaculation in the male.\nBecause the pelvis does not include a cutaneous area, pelvic sympathetic\nfibers do not produce pilomotion or vasomotion functions. The parasympathetic\nfibers distributed within the pelvis stimulate contraction of the rectum and\nbladder for defecation and urination, respectively. Parasympathetic fibers in the\nprostatic plexus penetrate the pelvic floor to reach the erectile bodies of the\nexternal genitalia, producing erection.\nVISCERAL AFFERENT INNERVATION IN PELVIS\nVisceral afferent fibers travel with autonomic nerve fibers, although the sensory\nimpulses are conducted centrally, retrograde to the efferent impulses conveyed\nby the autonomic fibers. All visceral afferent fibers conducting reflexive\nsensation (information that does not reach consciousness) travel with\nparasympathetic fibers. Therefore, in the case of the pelvis, they travel through\nthe pelvic and inferior hypogastric plexuses and the pelvic splanchnic nerves to\nthe spinal sensory ganglia of spinal nerves S2\u2013S4.\n1358"

Most arterial blood is delivered to the lesser pelvis by the\ninternal iliac arteries, which commonly bifurcate into an anterior division\n(providing all the visceral branches) and a posterior division (usually\nexclusively parietal). \u2022 Postnatally, the umbilical arteries become occluded\ndistal to the origin of the superior vesical arteries and, in the male, the arteries\nto the ductus deferens. \u2022 The inferior vesical (males) and uterine arteries\n(females) supply the inferior bladder and pelvic urethra.

The ureters are retroperitoneal; their superior abdominal\nportions are described in Chapter 5, Abdomen. As the ureters cross the\nbifurcation of the common iliac artery (or the beginning of the external iliac\nartery), they pass over the pelvic brim, thus leaving the abdomen and entering\nthe lesser pelvis (Fig. 6.24A, B). The pelvic parts of the ureters run on the lateral\nwalls of the pelvis, parallel to the anterior margin of the greater sciatic notch,\nbetween the parietal pelvic peritoneum and the internal iliac arteries. Opposite\nthe ischial spine, they curve anteromedially, superior to the levator ani, and enter\nthe urinary bladder. The inferior ends of the ureters are surrounded by the vesical\nvenous plexus (Fig. 6.19B, C).\nThe ureters pass obliquely through the muscular wall of the urinary bladder\nin an inferomedial direction, entering the outer surface of the bladder\napproximately 5 cm apart, but their internal openings into the lumen of the\nempty bladder are separated by only half that distance. This oblique passage\nthrough the bladder wall forms a one-way \u201cflap valve,\u201d the internal pressure of\nthe filling bladder causing the intramural passage to collapse. In addition,\ncontractions of the bladder musculature act as a sphincter preventing the reflux\nof urine into the ureters when the bladder contracts, increasing internal pressure\nduring micturition. Urine passes down the ureters by means of peristaltic\ncontractions, a few drops being transported at intervals of 12\u201320 seconds (Fig.\n6.24B).\nIn males, the only structure that passes between the ureter and the\nperitoneum is the ductus deferens (see Fig. 6.34); it crosses the ureter within the\nureteric fold of peritoneum.

The body of the\nbladder is the major portion of the bladder between the apex and the fundus.\nThe fundus and inferolateral surfaces meet inferiorly at the neck of the bladder.\nThe bladder bed is formed by the structures that directly contact it. On each\nside, the pubic bones and fascia covering the levator ani and superior obturator\ninternus muscle lie in contact with the inferolateral surfaces of the bladder (Fig.\n6.28C). Only the superior surface is covered by peritoneum. Consequently, in\nmales, the fundus is separated from the rectum centrally by only the fascial\nrectovesical septum and laterally by the seminal glands and ampullae of the\nductus deferentes (Fig. 6.27A). In females, the fundus is directly related to the\nsuperior anterior wall of the vagina (Fig. 6.27B). The bladder is enveloped by a\nloose connective tissue visceral fascia.\nThe walls of the bladder are composed chiefly of the detrusor muscle.\nToward the neck of the male bladder, the muscle fibers form the involuntary\ninternal urethral sphincter. This sphincter contracts during ejaculation to\nprevent retrograde ejaculation (ejaculatory reflux) of semen into the bladder.\nSome fibers run radially and assist in opening the internal urethral orifice. In\nmales, the muscle fibers in the neck of the bladder are continuous with the\nfibromuscular tissue of the prostate, whereas in females, these fibers are\ncontinuous with muscle fibers in the wall of the urethra.\n1375"

The ureteric orifices are encircled by loops\nof detrusor musculature that tighten when the bladder contracts to assist in\npreventing reflux of urine into the ureter. The uvula of the bladder is a slight\nelevation of the trigone. It is usually more prominent in older men owing to\nenlargement of the posterior lobe of the prostate (see Fig. 6.30A).\nArterial Supply and Venous Drainage of Bladder. The main arteries\nsupplying the bladder are branches of the internal iliac arteries (see Table 6.4).\nThe superior vesical arteries supply anterosuperior parts of the bladder. In\nmales, the inferior vesical arteries supply the fundus and neck of the bladder. In\nfemales, the vaginal arteries replace the inferior vesical arteries and send small\nbranches to postero-inferior parts of the bladder (see Fig. 6.17B). The obturator\nand inferior gluteal arteries also supply small branches to the bladder.\nThe veins draining blood from the bladder correspond to the arteries and are\ntributaries of the internal iliac veins. In males, the vesical venous plexus is\ncontinuous with the prostatic venous plexus (see Fig. 6.19C), and the combined\nplexus complex envelops the fundus of the bladder and prostate, the seminal\nglands, the ductus deferentes, and the inferior ends of the ureters. It also receives\nblood from the deep dorsal vein of the penis, which drains into the prostatic\nvenous plexus. The vesical venous plexus is the venous network that is most\ndirectly associated with the bladder itself. It mainly drains through the inferior\nvesical veins into the internal iliac veins; however, it may drain through the\nsacral veins into the internal vertebral venous plexuses. In females, the vesical\nvenous plexus envelops the pelvic part of the urethra and the neck of the bladder,\nreceives blood from the dorsal vein of the clitoris, and communicates with the\nvaginal or uterovaginal venous plexus (Fig. 6.19B).\nInnervation of Bladder. Sympathetic fibers are conveyed from inferior\nthoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord levels to the vesical (pelvic) plexuses\nprimarily through the hypogastric plexuses and nerves, whereas parasympathetic\nfibers from sacral spinal cord levels are conveyed by the pelvic splanchnic\nnerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus (Fig. 6.29). The parasympathetic\nfibers are motor to the detrusor muscle and inhibitory to the internal urethral\nsphincter of the male bladder. Consequently, when visceral afferent fibers are\nstimulated by stretching, the bladder contracts reflexively, the internal urethral\nsphincter relaxes (in males), and urine flows into the urethra. With toilet training,\nwe learn to suppress this reflex when we do not wish to void. The sympathetic\ninnervation that stimulates ejaculation simultaneously causes contraction of the\n1376"

During filling, the neck of\nthe bladder is tonically contracted so the internal urethral orifice is small and\nhigh. During emptying, the neck of the bladder is relaxed so the orifice is wide\nand low. The most prominent feature of the prostatic urethra is the urethral\ncrest, a median ridge between bilateral grooves, the prostatic sinuses (Fig.\n6.30). The secretory prostatic ducts open into the prostatic sinuses. The seminal\ncolliculus is a rounded eminence in the middle of the urethral crest with a slit-\nlike orifice that opens into a small cul-de-sac, the prostatic utricle. The utricle is\nthe vestigial remnant of the embryonic uterovaginal canal, the surrounding walls\nof which, in the female, constitute the primordium of the uterus and a part of the\nvagina (Moore et al., 2016). The ejaculatory ducts open into the prostatic urethra\nvia minute, slit-like openings located adjacent to and occasionally just within the\norifice of the prostatic utricle.

The musculature surrounding the internal urethral orifice of the\nfemale bladder is not organized into an internal sphincter. The female external\nurethral orifice is located in the vestibule of the vagina, the cleft between the\nlabia minora of the external genitalia, directly anterior to the vaginal orifice\n(ostium). The urethra lies anterior to the vagina (forming an elevation in the\nanterior vaginal wall; see Fig. 6.39B). Its axis is parallel to that of the vagina\n(Fig. 6.27B). The urethra passes with the vagina through the pelvic diaphragm,\nexternal urethral sphincter, and perineal membrane.\nUrethral glands are present, particularly in the superior part of the urethra.\nOne group of glands on each side, the para-urethral glands, are homologs to the\nprostate. These glands have a common para-urethral duct, which opens (one on\neach side) near the external urethral orifice. The external urethral sphincter is\nlocated in the perineum and is discussed in that section.\nArterial Supply and Venous Drainage of Female Urethra.

Visceral afferents from most of the urethra run in the pelvic\nsplanchnic nerves, but the termination receives somatic afferents from the\npudendal nerve.

Ureteric\ncalculi may cause complete or intermittent obstruction of urinary flow. The\nobstruction may occur anywhere along the ureter, but it occurs most often at the\nthree sites where the ureters are normally relatively constricted (Fig. 6.24A): (1)\nat the junction of the ureters and renal pelves, (2) where they cross the external\niliac artery and pelvic brim, and (3) during their passage through the wall of the\nurinary bladder (Fig. B6.7B).\nThe presence of calculi can often be confirmed by an abdominal radiograph,\nan intravenous urogram.

When intra-abdominal pressure increases (as when relaxing the\npelvic floor and \u201cbearing down\u201d to compress the bladder during urination), the\nbase of the bladder and upper urethra is pushed against the anterior wall of the\nvagina, which lacking support will in turn bulge into the vaginal lumen and may\nprotrude through the vaginal orifice into the vestibule\u2014cystocele (herniation of\nthe urinary bladder) (Fig. B6.8). Even in the absence of a cystocele, weakened\nsupport to the vagina or pelvic floor may result in a lack of support of the\nurethra, which runs in close proximity to (essentially \u201cembedded against\u201d) the\nanterior vaginal wall.

Presynaptic sympathetic fibers originate\nfrom cell bodies in the intermediolateral cell column of the T12\u2013L2 (or L3)\nspinal cord segments. They traverse the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic\ntrunks to become components of lumbar (abdominopelvic) splanchnic nerves\nand the hypogastric and pelvic plexuses (see Fig. 6.29).\nPresynaptic parasympathetic fibers from S2 and S3 spinal cord segments\ntraverse pelvic splanchnic nerves, which also join the inferior hypogastric/pelvic\nplexuses. Synapses with postsynaptic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons\noccur within the plexuses, en route to or near the pelvic viscera. As part of an\norgasm, the sympathetic system stimulates contraction of the internal urethral\nsphincter to prevent retrograde ejaculation. Simultaneously, it stimulates rapid\nperistaltic-like contractions of the ductus deferens, and the combined contraction\nof and secretion from the seminal glands and prostate that provide the vehicle\n(semen), and the expulsive force to discharge the sperms during ejaculation.

Its tone during sitting and standing and active contraction during\nperiods of increased intra-abdominal pressure (sneezing, coughing, etc.) is\ntransmitted through the surrounding pelvic organs and the endopelvic fascia in\nwhich they are embedded. Passive support of the uterus is provided by its\nposition\u2014the way in which the normally anteverted and anteflexed uterus rests\non top of the bladder (Fig. 6.43A). When intra-abdominal pressure is increased,\nthe uterus is pressed against the bladder. The cervix is the least mobile part of the\nuterus because of the passive support provided by attached condensations of\nendopelvic fascia (ligaments), which may also contain smooth muscle (Figs.\n6.13 and 6.14):\nCardinal (transverse cervical) ligaments extend from the supravaginal cervix\nand lateral parts of the fornix of the vagina to the lateral walls of the pelvis\n(Fig. 6.14).\nUterosacral ligaments pass superiorly and slightly posteriorly from the sides\nof the cervix to the middle of the sacrum; they are palpable during a rectal\nexamination.\nTogether, these passive and active supports keep the uterus centered in the\npelvic cavity and resist the tendency for the uterus to fall or be pushed through\nthe vagina (see the Clinical Box \u201cDisposition of Uterus\u201d).\nRelations of Uterus.

The anesthesia bathes the spinal nerve roots, including\nthe pain fibers from the uterine cervix and superior vagina and the afferent\nfibers from the pudendal nerve. Therefore, the entire birth canal, pelvic floor,\nand majority of the perineum are anesthetized, but the lower limbs are not\nusually affected. The pain fibers from the uterine body (superior to the pelvic\npain line) ascend to the inferior thoracic\u2013superior lumbar levels. These and the\nfibers superior to them are not affected by the anesthetic, so the mother is aware\nof her uterine contractions. The spinal epidural space does not continue into the\ncranial cavity (see Fig. 8.28C in Chapter 8, Head), so the anesthetic agent\ncannot ascend beyond the foramen magnum.\nSpinal anesthesia, in which the anesthetic agent is introduced through the\ndura and arachnoid mater with a needle into the spinal subarachnoid space at the\nL3\u2013L4 vertebral level (B in Fig. B6.27), produces complete anesthesia inferior\nto approximately the waist level. The perineum, pelvic floor, and birth canal are\nanesthetized, and motor and sensory functions of the entire lower limbs, as well\nas sensation of uterine contractions, are temporarily blocked. Spinal anesthesia\noften is used for limited-duration procedures, such as postpartum sterilization or\nforceps delivery, or for the second stage of labor. Depending on the agent used,\nits effects last for 30\u2013250 minutes. If labor is extended or the level of anesthesia\nis inadequate, it may be difficult or impossible to re-administer the anesthesia.\nBecause the anesthetic agent is heavier than cerebrospinal fluid, it remains in\nthe inferior spinal subarachnoid space while the patient is inclined. The\nanesthetic agent circulates into the cerebral subarachnoid space in the cranial\ncavity when the patient lies flat following the delivery. Consequently, a severe\n\u201cspinal headache\u201d is a potential complication with spinal anesthesia that cannot\noccur with epidural anesthesia.\nWith both epidural and spinal anesthesia, there is a risk that cerebrospinal\nfluid can leak out of the subarachnoid space. With an epidural, this happens\nwhen the needle inadvertently pierces the dura and arachnoid mater. With a\nspinal block, the needle deliberately pierces the dura and arachnoid. As\ncerebrospinal fluid leaks out, it decreases pressure within the canal, which can\nlead to a severe headache. In severe cases, the headache can be treated using an\nautologous blood patch, in which a small amount of the patient\u2019s blood is\ninjected into the epidural space to fill the hole made by the needle.\n1449"

The\nsubcutaneous tissue of the perineum, like that of the inferior anterior\nabdominal wall, consists of a superficial fatty layer and a deep membranous\nlayer, the (superficial) perineal fascia (Colles fascia).\nIn females, the fatty layer of subcutaneous tissue of the perineum makes\nup the substance of the labia majora and mons pubis and is continuous anteriorly\nand superiorly with the fatty layer of subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen\n(Camper fascia) (Fig. 6.53A, C). In males, the fatty layer is greatly diminished in\nthe urogenital triangle, being replaced altogether in the penis and scrotum with\nsmooth (dartos) muscle. It is continuous between the penis or scrotum and thighs\nwith the fatty layer of subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen (Fig. 6.53B, D). In\nboth sexes, the fatty layer of subcutaneous tissue of the perineum is continuous\nposteriorly with the ischio-anal fat pad in the anal region (Fig. 6.53E).\nThe membranous perineal fascia does not extend into the anal triangle. It is\nattached posteriorly to the posterior margin of the perineal membrane and\nperineal body (Fig. 6.53A, B).

The female urethral sphincter complex\nis shown.\nCurrent Concept of Deep Perineal Pouch and External Urethral\nSphincter. In the female, the posterior edge of the perineal membrane is\ntypically occupied by a mass of smooth muscle in the place of the deep\ntransverse perineal muscles (Wendell-Smith, 1995). Immediately superior to the\nposterior half of the perineal membrane, the flat, sheet-like, deep transverse\nperineal muscle, when developed (typically only in males), offers dynamic\nsupport for the pelvic viscera. As described by Oelrich (1980), however, the\nurethral sphincter muscle is not a flat, planar structure, and the only \u201csuperior\nfascia\u201d is the intrinsic fascia of the external urethral sphincter muscle.\nContemporary views consider the inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm to be\nthe superior boundary of the deep pouch (Fig. 6.53C, D\u2013E). In both views, the\nstrong perineal membrane is the inferior boundary (floor) of the deep pouch,\nseparating it from the superficial pouch. The perineal membrane is indeed, with\nthe perineal body, the final passive support of the pelvic viscera.\nThe male external urethral sphincter is more like a tube or trough than a\ndisc. In the male, only the inferior part of the muscle forms an encircling\ninvestment (a true sphincter) for the intermediate part of the urethra inferior to\nthe prostate (Fig. 6.54B). Its larger, trough-like part extends vertically to the\nneck of the bladder as part of the isthmus of the prostate, displacing glandular\ntissue and investing the prostatic urethra anteriorly and anterolaterally only (see\nalso Fig. 6.38). Apparently, the muscular primordium is established around the\nwhole length of the urethra before development of the prostate. As the prostate\ndevelops from urethral glands, the posterior and posterolateral muscle atrophies\nor is displaced by the prostate. Whether this part of the muscle compresses or\ndilates the prostatic urethra is a matter of some controversy.\nThe female external urethral sphincter is more properly a \u201curogenital\nsphincter\u201d (Oelrich, 1983). Here, too, a part forms a true anular sphincter around\nthe urethra (Fig. 6.54C), with several additional parts extending from it: a\nsuperior part, extending to the neck of the bladder; a subdivision described as\nextending inferolaterally to the ischial ramus on each side (the compressor\nurethrae muscle); and yet another band-like part, which encircles both the vagina\nand the urethra (urethrovaginal sphincter).

It extends from the superior aspect of the pelvic diaphragm to the\nanus (Figs. 6.55B and 6.56). The anal canal (2.5\u20133.5 cm long) begins as the\nrectal ampulla narrows proximal to the level of the U-shaped sling formed by the\npuborectalis muscle (Fig. 6.12). The anal canal ends at the anus, the external\noutlet of the alimentary tract. The anal canal, surrounded by internal and external\nanal sphincters, descends postero-inferiorly between the anococcygeal ligament\nand the perineal body. The canal is collapsed except during passage of feces.\nBoth sphincters must relax before defecation can occur.\nThe internal anal sphincter (Figs. 6.55A and 6.56) is an involuntary\nsphincter surrounding the superior two thirds of the anal canal. It is a thickening\nof the circular muscle layer. Its contraction (tonus) is stimulated and maintained\nby sympathetic fibers from the superior rectal (peri-arterial) and hypogastric\nplexuses. Its contraction is inhibited by parasympathetic fiber stimulation, both\nintrinsically in relation to peristalsis and extrinsically by fibers conveyed by the\npelvic splanchnic nerves. This sphincter is tonically contracted most of the time\nto prevent leakage of fluid or flatus; however, it relaxes (is inhibited) temporarily\nin response to distension of the rectal ampulla by feces or gas, requiring\nvoluntary contraction of the puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter if\ndefecation or flatulence is to be prevented. The ampulla relaxes after initial\ndistension (when peristalsis subsides) and tonus returns until the next peristalsis,\nor until a threshold level of distension occurs, at which point inhibition of the\nsphincter is continuous until distension is relieved.\nThe external anal sphincter is a large voluntary sphincter that forms a\nbroad band on each side of the inferior two thirds of the anal canal (Figs. 6.52E,\n6.55, and 6.56).

These columns contain the terminal\nbranches of the superior rectal artery and vein. The anorectal junction,\nindicated by the superior ends of the anal columns, is where the rectum joins the\nanal canal. At this point, the wide rectal ampulla abruptly narrows as it traverses\nthe pelvic diaphragm. The inferior ends of the anal columns are joined by anal\nvalves. Superior to the valves are small recesses called anal sinuses. When\ncompressed by feces, the anal sinuses exude mucus, which aids in evacuation of\nfeces from the anal canal.\nThe inferior comb-shaped limit of the anal valves forms an irregular line, the\npectinate line (dentate line) (Fig. 6.59), that indicates the junction of the\nsuperior part of the anal canal (visceral; derived from the embryonic hindgut)\nand the inferior part (somatic; derived from the embryonic proctodeum).\nFIGURE 6.59.

This\ntransition reflects the embryological development of the\nanorectum.\nThe anal canal superior to the pectinate line differs from the part inferior to\nthe pectinate line in its histology, arterial supply, innervation, and venous and\nlymphatic drainage (Fig. 6.59). These differences result from the different\nembryological origins of the superior and inferior parts of the anal canal (Moore\net al., 2016).\nArterial Supply of Anal Canal. The superior rectal artery supplies the anal\ncanal superior to the pectinate line (Figs. 6.32A and 6.59). The two inferior\nrectal arteries supply the anal canal inferior to the pectinate line as well as the\nsurrounding muscles and peri-anal skin (Figs. 6.32, 6.58, and 6.59; Table 6.8).\nThe middle rectal arteries assist with the blood supply to the anal canal by\nforming anastomoses with the superior and inferior rectal arteries.\nVenous and Lymphatic Drainage of Anal Canal. The internal rectal\nvenous plexus drains in both directions from the level of the pectinate line.\nSuperior to the pectinate line, the internal rectal plexus drains chiefly into the\nsuperior rectal vein (a tributary of the inferior mesenteric vein) and the portal\nsystem (Figs. 6.32B and 6.59). Inferior to the pectinate line, the internal rectal\nplexus drains into the inferior rectal veins (tributaries of the caval venous\nsystem) around the margin of the external anal sphincter. The middle rectal veins\n(tributaries of the internal iliac veins) mainly drain the muscularis externa of the\nampulla and form anastomoses with the superior and inferior rectal veins. In\naddition to the abundant venous anastomoses, the rectal plexuses receive\nmultiple arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) from the superior and middle rectal\narteries.\nThe normal submucosa of the anorectal junction is markedly thickened and\nin section has the appearance of a cavernous (erectile) tissue, owing to the\npresence of the sacculated veins of the internal rectal venous plexus. The\nvascular submucosa is especially thickened in the left lateral, right anterolateral,\nand right posterolateral positions, forming anal cushions, or threshold pads, at\nthe point of closure of the anal canal. Because these cushions contain plexuses of\nsaccular veins capable of directly receiving arterial blood via multiple AVAs,\nthey are variably pliable and turgid and form a sort of flutter valve that\ncontributes to the normally water- and gas-tight closure of the anal canal.\n1476"

Inferior to the pectinate line, the\nlymphatic vessels drain superficially into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes,\nas does most of the perineum.\nInnervation of Anal Canal. The nerve supply to the anal canal superior to\nthe pectinate line is visceral innervation from the inferior hypogastric plexus,\ninvolving sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral afferent fibers (Figs. 6.33\nand 6.59). Sympathetic fibers maintain the tonus of the internal anal sphincter.\nParasympathetic fibers inhibit the tonus of the internal sphincter and evoke\nperistaltic contraction for defecation. The superior part of the anal canal, like the\nrectum superior to it, is inferior to the pelvic pain line (see Table 6.3). All\nvisceral afferents travel with the parasympathetic fibers to spinal sensory ganglia\nS2\u2013S4. Superior to the pectinate line, the anal canal is sensitive only to\nstretching, which evokes sensations at both the conscious and unconscious\n(reflex) levels. For example, distension of the rectal ampulla inhibits (relaxes)\nthe tonus of the internal sphincter.\nThe nerve supply of the anal canal inferior to the pectinate line is somatic\ninnervation derived from the inferior anal (rectal) nerves, branches of the\npudendal nerve.

It relies on specific\nmeasurements of nine defined points, with the point of reference being the\nhymenal ring. According to this system, there are four degrees of prolapse:\n1. Prolapse of the organ halfway to the hymen\n2. Prolapse of the organ to the hymen\n3. Prolapse of the organ past the hymen\n4. Maximum descent of the organ\nTreatment for pelvic organ prolapse includes pelvic floor (e.g., Kegel)\nexercises, pessaries (devices that are inserted into the vagina to support the\nprolapsed organs), and various surgical interventions.\n Episiotomy\nDuring vaginal surgery and labor, an episiotomy (surgical incision of the\nperineum and inferoposterior vaginal wall) may be made to enlarge the vaginal\norifice, with the intention of decreasing excessive traumatic tearing of the\nperineum and uncontrolled jagged tears of the perineal muscles. Once routinely\nperformed, episiotomies are now markedly less commonly performed in vaginal\ndeliveries in the United States (Gabbe et al., 2007).

The rationale of the median incision is that the scar produced\nas the wound heals will not be greatly different from the fibrous tissue\nsurrounding it.

The urethra is not uniform in its caliber: the external\nurethral orifice and intermediate part are narrowest. Attempting\nto approach this \u201cstraight line\u201d position as much as possible\nfacilitates passage of a catheter or other transurethral device.\nThe spongy (penile) urethra begins at the distal end of the intermediate part\nof the urethra and ends at the male external urethral orifice, which is slightly\nnarrower than any of the other parts of the urethra. The lumen of the spongy\nurethra is approximately 5 mm in diameter; however, it is expanded in the bulb\nof the penis to form the intrabulbar fossa and in the glans penis to form the\nnavicular fossa.

C. CT scan at level of\nsuperficial pouch of a male. (Courtesy of Dr. Donald R. Cahill,\nDepartment of Anatomy, Mayo Medical School, Rochester,\nMN.)\nPENIS\nThe penis is the male copulatory organ and, by conveying the urethra, provides\nthe common outlet for urine and semen (Figs. 6.60, 3.61, and 3.62). The penis\nconsists of a root, body, and glans. It is composed of three cylindrical cavernous\nbodies of erectile tissue: the paired corpora cavernosa dorsally and the single\ncorpus spongiosum ventrally. In the anatomical position, the penis is erect;\nwhen the penis is flaccid, its dorsum is directed anteriorly. Each cavernous body\nhas an outer fibrous covering or capsule, the tunica albuginea (Fig. 6.61C).\nSuperficial to the outer covering is the deep fascia of the penis (Buck fascia),\nthe continuation of the deep perineal fascia that forms a strong membranous\ncovering for the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, binding them\ntogether (Fig. 6.61C, D). The corpus spongiosum contains the spongy urethra.\nThe corpora cavernosa are fused with each other in the median plane, except\nposteriorly where they separate to form the crura of the penis (Figs. 6.60 and\n6.62B). Internally, the cavernous tissue of the corpora is separated (usually\nincompletely) by the septum penis (Fig. 6.61C).\nThe root of the penis, the attached part, consists of the crura, bulb, and\nischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles (Figs. 6.60 and 6.62A, B). The\nroot is located in the superficial perineal pouch, between the perineal membrane\nsuperiorly and the deep perineal fascia inferiorly (see Fig. 6.53B, D). The crura\nand bulb of the penis consist of erectile tissue. Each crus is attached to the\ninferior part of the internal surface of the corresponding ischial ramus (see Fig.\n1495"

The enlarged posterior part of the bulb\nof the penis is penetrated superiorly by the urethra, continuing from its\nintermediate part (Figs. 6.60 and 6.62B).\nThe body of the penis is the free pendulous part that is suspended from the\npubic symphysis. Except for a few fibers of the bulbospongiosus muscle near the\nroot of the penis and the ischiocavernosus muscle that embrace the crura, the\nbody of the penis has no muscles (Fig. 6.62).\nThe penis consists of thin skin, connective tissue, blood and lymphatic\nvessels, fascia, the corpora cavernosa, and corpus spongiosum containing the\nspongy urethra (Fig. 6.61C). Distally, the corpus spongiosum expands to form\nthe conical glans penis, or head of the penis (Figs. 6.61A, B, D and 6.62B). The\nmargin of the glans projects beyond the ends of the corpora cavernosa to form\nthe corona of the glans. The corona overhangs an obliquely grooved\nconstriction, the neck of the glans, which separates the glans from the body of\nthe penis. The slit-like opening of the spongy urethra, the external urethral\norifice (meatus), is near the tip of the glans penis.\nThe skin of the penis is thin, darkly pigmented relative to adjacent skin and\nconnected to the tunica albuginea by loose connective tissue. At the neck of the\nglans, the skin and fascia of the penis are prolonged as a double layer of skin, the\nprepuce (foreskin), which in uncircumcised males covers the glans penis to a\nvariable extent (Fig 6.61E). The frenulum of the prepuce is a median fold that\npasses from the deep layer of the prepuce to the urethral surface of the glans\n(Fig. 6.61A, D).\nThe suspensory ligament of the penis is a condensation of deep fascia that\narises from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis (Fig. 6.63). The ligament\npasses inferiorly and splits to form a sling that is attached to the deep fascia of\nthe penis at the junction of its root and body.

They give off numerous branches that open directly\ninto the cavernous spaces. When the penis is flaccid, these arteries are coiled,\nrestricting blood flow; they are called helicine arteries of the penis (G. helix, a\ncoil).\nVenous Drainage of Penis. Blood from the cavernous spaces is drained by a\nvenous plexus that joins the deep dorsal vein of the penis in the deep fascia\n(Figs. 6.61C and 6.63). This vein passes between the laminae of the suspensory\nligament of the penis, inferior to the inferior pubic ligament and anterior to the\nperineal membrane, to enter the pelvis, where it drains into the prostatic venous\nplexus. Blood from the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the penis drains into the\nsuperficial dorsal vein(s), which drain(s) into the superficial external pudendal\nvein. Some blood also passes to the internal pudendal vein.\nInnervation of Penis.

Some physicians recommend that men perform a self-\nexamination of their testicles monthly after puberty and report any testicular or\nscrotal changes. It is normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other.\nMost commonly, the left testis lies at a more inferior level than the right one.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, although testicular cancer can\noccur at any age, about half of all cases occur between the ages of 20 and 34.\nThe lifetime risk of developing testicular cancer is 1 in 263, making it a\nrelatively uncommon type of cancer. The risk of dying from testicular cancer is\nabout 1 in 5,000. Testicular cancer can be treated and usually cured, especially\nwhen found early in the course of the disease.\n Hypospadias\nHypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the penis, occurring in 1 in\n300 newborns. In the simplest and most common form, glanular hypospadias,\nthe external urethral orifice is on the ventral aspect of the glans penis. In other\ninfants, the defect is in the body of the penis (penile hypospadias) (Fig.\nB6.33A) or in the perineum (penoscrotal or scrotal hypospadias) (Fig. B6.33B).\nHence, the external urethral orifice is on the urethral surface of the penis. The\nembryological basis of penile and penoscrotal hypospadias is failure of the\nurogenital folds to fuse on the ventral surface of the penis, completing the\nformation of the spongy urethra. It is believed that hypospadias is associated\nwith an inadequate production of androgens by the fetal testes. Differences in\nthe timing and degree of hormonal insufficiency probably account for the\n1507"

The prepuce is usually sufficiently elastic for it to be retracted over\nthe glans. In some males, it fits tightly over the glans and cannot be retracted\neasily (phimosis) if at all. As there are modified sebaceous glands in the\nprepuce, the oily secretions of cheesy consistency (smegma) from them\naccumulate in the preputial sac, the space between the glans and prepuce,\ncausing irritation.\nIn some males, retraction of the prepuce over the corona of the glans penis\nconstricts the neck of the glans so much that there is interference with the\ndrainage of blood and tissue fluid. In persons with this condition\n(paraphimosis), the glans may enlarge so much that the prepuce cannot be\ndrawn over it. Circumcision is commonly performed in such cases.\nCircumcision, surgical excision of the prepuce, is the most commonly\nperformed minor surgical operation on male infants. Following circumcision,\nthe glans penis is exposed (see Fig. 6.61B). Although it is a religious practice in\nIslam and Judaism, it is often done routinely for nonreligious reasons (a\npreference usually explained in terms of tradition or hygiene) in North America.\nIn adults, circumcision is usually performed when phimosis or paraphimosis\noccurs.\n Impotence and Erectile Dysfunction\nInability to obtain an erection (impotence) may result from several causes.\nWhen a lesion of the prostatic plexus or cavernous nerves results in an inability\nto achieve an erection, a surgically implanted, semirigid or inflatable penile\nprosthesis may assume the role of the erectile bodies, providing the rigidity\nnecessary to insert and move the penis within the vagina during intercourse.\n1510"

It is considered primarily a developmental vestige.\nHowever, its condition (and that of the frenulum of the labia minora) often\nprovides critical evidence in cases of child abuse and rape.\nBulbs of Vestibule. The bulbs of the vestibule are paired masses of\nelongated erectile tissue, approximately 3 cm in length (Fig. 6.68). The bulbs lie\nalong the sides of the vaginal orifice, superior or deep to (not within) the labia\nminora, immediately inferior to the perineal membrane (see Fig. 6.52D, E).

The greater vestibular glands (Bartholin glands),\napproximately 0.5 cm in diameter, are located in the superficial perineal pouch.\nThey lie on each side of the vestibule of the vagina, posterolateral to the vaginal\norifice and inferior to the perineal membrane; thus, they are in the superficial\nperineal pouch (Fig. 6.52D). The greater vestibular glands are round or oval and\nare partly overlapped posteriorly by the bulbs of the vestibule. Like the bulbs,\nthey are partially surrounded by the bulbospongiosus muscles.

These glands secrete mucus into the vestibule\nof the vagina during sexual arousal (see the Clinical Box \u201cInfection of Greater\nVestibular Glands\u201d).\nThe lesser vestibular glands are small glands on each side of the vestibule\nof the vagina that open into it between the urethral and vaginal orifices.

When patients continue to complain of pain sensation\nafter proper administration of a pudendal or pudendal and ilio-inguinal nerve\nblocks, it is usually the result of overlapping innervation by the perineal branch\nat the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh. Other types of anesthesia for\nchildbirth are explained and compared in the Clinical Box \u201cAnesthesia for\nChildbirth\u201d (earlier in this chapter).\n Exercises for Strengthening of Female\nPerineal Muscles\nThe superficial transverse perineal muscle, bulbospongiosus, and external anal\nsphincter, through their common attachment to the perineal body, form crossing\nbeams over the pelvic outlet to support the perineal body and pelvic diaphragm,\nas in males. In the absence of the functional demands related to urination, penile\nerection, and ejaculation in males, the muscles are commonly relatively\nunderdeveloped in women. However, when developed, they contribute to the\nsupport of the pelvic viscera and help prevent urinary stress incontinence and\npostpartum prolapse of pelvic viscera. Therefore, many gynecologists as well as\nprepartum classes for participatory childbirth recommend that women practice\nKegel exercises (named for A. H. Kegel, a 20th-century U.S. gynecologist)\nusing the perineal muscles, such as successive interruption of the urine flow\nduring urination. Some prepartum childbirth classes teach that in learning to\nvoluntarily contract and relax the perineal muscles, women may be able to resist\nthe tendency to contract the musculature during uterine contractions, allowing a\nless obstructed passage for the fetus and decreasing the likelihood of tearing the\nperineal muscles. The efficacy of this is controversial.\n Vaginismus\nVaginismus is defined as involuntary (reflex) muscle spasms that occur when\nvaginal penetration is attempted (when perineal muscles are distended).\nVaginismus may be limited to specific situations (e.g., sexual intercourse) or in\nall situations in which vaginal penetration is attempted (tampon insertion,\ngynecologic exams). It may cause dyspareunia (painful intercourse); in severe\n1524"

It includes two parts of the lower limb: the\nrounded, prominent posterior region, the buttocks (L. nates, clunes), and the\nlateral, usually less prominent hip region (L. regio coxae), which overlies\nthe hip joint and greater trochanter of the femur. The \u201cwidth of the hips\u201d in\ncommon terminology is a reference to one\u2019s transverse dimensions at the\nlevel of the greater trochanters. The gluteal region is bounded superiorly by\nthe iliac crest, medially by the intergluteal cleft (natal cleft), and inferiorly\nby the skin fold (groove) underlying the buttocks, the gluteal fold (L. sulcus\nglutealis). The gluteal muscles, overlying the pelvic girdle, constitute the\nbulk of this region.\n2. The femoral region (thigh) is the region of the free lower limb that lies\nbetween the gluteal, abdominal, and perineal regions proximally and the\nknee region distally. It includes most of the femur (thigh bone). The\ntransition from the trunk to the free lower limb occurs abruptly in the\ninguinal region (groin). Here, the boundary between the abdominal and\nperineal regions and the femoral region is demarcated by the inguinal\nligament anteriorly and the ischiopubic ramus of the hip bone (part of the\npelvic girdle or skeleton of the pelvis) medially. Posteriorly, the gluteal fold\nseparates the gluteal and femoral regions (see Fig. 7.47A).\n3. The knee region (L. regio genus) includes the prominences (condyles) of the\ndistal femur and proximal tibia, head of the fibula, and patella (knee cap,\nwhich lies anterior to the distal end of the femur), as well as the joints\nbetween these bony structures. The posterior region of the knee (L. poples)\nincludes a well-defined, fat-filled hollow, transmitting neurovascular\nstructures, called the popliteal fossa.\n4. The leg region (L. regio cruris) is the part that lies between the knee and the\nnarrow, distal part of the leg. It includes most of the tibia (shin bone) and\nfibula (calf bone).

At the knees, the distal end of each\nfemur articulates with the patella and tibia of the corresponding leg. Weight is\ntransferred from the knee joint to the ankle joint by the tibia. The fibula does not\narticulate with the femur and therefore does not bear or transfer weight. The role\nof the fibula is to provide for muscle attachment and contribute to the formation\nof the ankle joint.\nAt the ankle, the weight borne by the tibia is transferred to the talus (Fig.\n7.4). The talus is the keystone of a longitudinal arch formed by the tarsal and\nmetatarsal bones of each foot that distributes the weight evenly between the heel\nand forefoot when standing, creating a flexible but stable bony platform to\nsupport the body.\nHip Bone\nThe mature hip bone (L. os coxae) is the large, flat pelvic bone formed by the\nfusion of three primary bones\u2014ilium, ischium, and pubis\u2014at the end of the\nteenage years. Each of the three bones is formed from its own primary center of\nossification; five secondary centers of ossification appear later.\nAt birth, the three primary bones are joined by hyaline cartilage; in children,\nthey are incompletely ossified (Fig. 7.5). At puberty, the three bones are still\nseparated by a Y-shaped triradiate cartilage centered in the acetabulum,\nalthough the two parts of the ischiopubic rami fuse by the 9th year (Fig. 7.5B).\nThe bones begin to fuse between 15 and 17 years of age; fusion is complete\nbetween 20 and 25 years of age. Little or no trace of the lines of fusion of the\nprimary bones is visible in older adults (Fig. 7.6).

The auricular surface of the ilium\narticulates with a corresponding surface of the sacrum to form\nthe sacro-iliac joint.\nBecause much of the medial aspect of the hip bones/bony pelvis is primarily\nconcerned with pelvic and perineal structures and functions (Chapter 6, Pelvis\nand Perineum) or their union with the vertebral column (Chapter 2, Back), it is\ndescribed more thoroughly in those chapters. Aspects of the hip bones concerned\nwith lower limb structures and functions, mainly involving their lateral aspects,\nare described in this chapter.\nIlium\nThe ilium forms the largest part of the hip bone and contributes the superior part\nof the acetabulum (Fig. 7.5B). The ilium has thick medial portions (columns) for\nweight bearing and thin, wing-like, posterolateral portions, the alae (L. wings),\nthat provide broad surfaces for the fleshy attachment of muscles (Fig. 7.3).\nThe body of the ilium joins the pubis and ischium to form the acetabulum.\nAnteriorly, the ilium has stout anterior superior and anterior inferior iliac\nspines that provide attachment for ligaments and tendons of lower limb muscles\n(Fig. 7.6).\nBeginning at the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), the long curved and\nthickened superior border of the ala of the ilium, the iliac crest, extends\nposteriorly, terminating at the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). The crest\nserves as a protective \u201cbumper\u201d and is an important site of aponeurotic\nattachment for thin, sheet-like muscles and deep fascia.

The superior part of\nthe body of the ischium fuses with the pubis and ilium, forming the postero-\ninferior aspect of the acetabulum. The ramus of the ischium joins the inferior\nramus of the pubis to form a bar of bone, the ischiopubic ramus (Fig. 7.6A),\nwhich constitutes the inferomedial boundary of the obturator foramen. The\nposterior border of the ischium forms the inferior margin of a deep indentation,\nthe greater sciatic notch. The large, triangular ischial spine at the inferior\nmargin of this notch provides ligamentous attachment. This sharp demarcation\nseparates the greater sciatic notch from a more inferior, smaller, rounded, and\nsmooth-surfaced indentation, the lesser sciatic notch. The lesser sciatic notch\nserves as a trochlea or pulley for a muscle that emerges from the bony pelvis.\nThe rough bony projection at the junction of the inferior end of the body of the\nischium and its ramus is the large ischial tuberosity. The body\u2019s weight rests on\nthis tuberosity when sitting, and it provides the proximal, tendinous attachment\nof posterior thigh muscles.\nPUBIS\nThe pubis forms the anteromedial part of the hip bone, contributing the anterior\npart of the acetabulum, and provides proximal attachment for muscles of the\nmedial thigh. The pubis is divided into a flattened medially placed body and\nsuperior and inferior rami that project laterally from the body (Fig. 7.6).\nMedially, the symphysial surface of the body of the pubis articulates with\nthe corresponding surface of the body of the contralateral pubis by means of the\npubic symphysis (Fig. 7.3A).

The posterior margin of the superior ramus of the pubis has a sharp\nraised edge, the pecten pubis, which forms part of the pelvic brim (see Chapter\n6, Pelvis and Perineum).\nOBTURATOR FORAMEN\nThe obturator foramen is a large oval or irregularly triangular opening in the\nhip bone. It is bounded by the pubis and ischium and their rami. Except for a\nsmall passageway for the obturator nerve and vessels (obturator canal), the\nobturator foramen is closed by the thin, strong obturator membrane. The\npresence of the foramen minimizes bony mass (weight) while its closure by the\nobturator membrane still provides extensive surface area on both sides for fleshy\nmuscle attachment.\nACETABULUM\nThe acetabulum (L., shallow vinegar cup) is the large cup-shaped cavity or\nsocket on the lateral aspect of the hip bone that articulates with the head of the\nfemur to form the hip joint (Fig. 7.6A). All three primary bones forming the hip\nbone contribute to the formation of the acetabulum (Fig. 7.5).\nThe margin of the acetabulum is incomplete inferiorly at the acetabular\nnotch, which makes the fossa resemble a cup with a piece of its lip missing (Fig.\n7.6A). The rough depression in the floor of the acetabulum extending superiorly\nfrom the acetabular notch is the acetabular fossa. The acetabular notch and\nfossa also create a deficit in the smooth lunate surface of the acetabulum, the\narticular surface receiving the head of the femur.\nANATOMICAL POSITION OF HIP BONE\nSurfaces, borders, and relationships of the hip bone are described assuming that\nthe body is in the anatomical position.

When the femur is viewed along the long axis of the\nfemoral shaft, so that the proximal end is superimposed over the\ndistal end (F), it can be seen that the axis of the head and neck of\nthe femur forms a 12\u00b0 angle with the transverse axis of the\nfemoral condyles (angle of torsion).\nThe superior (proximal) end of the femur consists of a head, neck, and two\ntrochanters (greater and lesser). The round head of the femur makes up two\nthirds of a sphere that is covered with articular cartilage, except for a medially\nplaced depression or pit, the fovea for the ligament of the head. In early life,\nthe ligament gives passage to an artery supplying the epiphysis of the head. The\nneck of the femur is trapezoidal, with its narrow end supporting the head and its\nbroader base being continuous with the shaft. Its average diameter is three\nquarters that of the femoral head.\nThe proximal femur is \u201cbent\u201d (L-shaped) so that the long axis of the head\nand neck projects superomedially at an angle to that of the obliquely oriented\nshaft (Fig. 7.7A, B).

The angle of inclination allows greater mobility of\nthe femur at the hip joint because it places the head and neck more perpendicular\nto the acetabulum in the neutral position. The abductors and rotators of the thigh\nattach mainly to the apex of the angle (the greater trochanter) so they are pulling\non a lever (the short limb of the L) that is directed more laterally than vertically.\nThis provides increased leverage for the abductors and rotators of the thigh and\nallows the considerable mass of the abductors of the thigh to be placed superior\nto the femur (in the gluteal region) instead of lateral to it, freeing the lateral\naspect of the femoral shaft to provide an increased area for the fleshy attachment\nof the extensors of the knee.\nThe angle of inclination also allows the obliquity of the femur within the\n1550"

This is advantageous for bipedal walking; however, it\nimposes considerable strain on the neck of the femur. Consequently, fractures of\nthe femoral neck can occur in older people as a result of a slight stumble if the\nneck has been weakened by osteoporosis (pathologic reduction of bone mass).\nThe torsion of the proximal lower limb (femur) that occurred during\ndevelopment does not conclude with the long axis of the superior end of the\nfemur (head and neck) parallel to the transverse axis of the inferior end (femoral\ncondyles). When the femur is viewed superiorly (so that one is looking along the\nlong axis of the shaft), it is apparent that the two axes lie at an angle (the torsion\nangle or angle of declination), the mean of which is 7\u00b0 in males and 12\u00b0 in\nfemales. The torsion angle, combined with the angle of inclination, allows\nrotatory movements of the femoral head within the obliquely placed acetabulum\nto convert into flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, and rotational\nmovements of the thigh.\nWhere the femoral neck and shaft join, there are two large, blunt elevations,\nthe trochanters (Fig. 7.7A, B, and F). The abrupt, conical, and rounded lesser\ntrochanter (G., a runner) extends medially from the posteromedial part of the\njunction of the neck and shaft of the femur to give tendinous attachment to the\nprimary flexor of the thigh (the iliopsoas).\nThe greater trochanter is a large, laterally placed bony mass that projects\nsuperiorly and posteriorly where the neck joins the femoral shaft, providing\nattachment and leverage for abductors and rotators of the thigh. The site where\nthe neck and shaft join is indicated by the intertrochanteric line, a roughened\nridge formed by the attachment of a powerful ligament (iliofemoral ligament).\nThe intertrochanteric line runs from the greater trochanter and winds around the\nlesser trochanter to continue posteriorly and inferiorly as a less distinct ridge, the\nspiral line.\nA similar but smoother and more prominent ridge, the intertrochanteric\ncrest, joins the trochanters posteriorly. The rounded elevation on the crest is the\nquadrate tubercle. In anterior and posterior views (Fig. 7.7A, B), the greater\ntrochanter is in line with the femoral shaft.

Superiorly, the lateral lip blends\nwith the broad, rough gluteal tuberosity, and the medial lip continues as a\nnarrow, rough spiral line.\nThe spiral line extends toward the lesser trochanter and then passes to the\nanterior surface of the femur, where it is continuous with the intertrochanteric\nline. A prominent intermediate ridge, the pectineal line, extends from the central\npart of the linea aspera to the base of the lesser trochanter. Inferiorly, the linea\naspera divides into medial and lateral supracondylar lines, which lead to the\nmedial and lateral femoral condyles (Fig. 7.7B).\nThe medial and lateral femoral condyles make up nearly the entire inferior\n(distal) end of the femur. The two condyles are on the same horizontal level\nwhen the bone is in the anatomical position, so that if an isolated femur is placed\nupright with both condyles contacting the floor or tabletop, the femoral shaft will\nassume the same oblique position it occupies in the living body (about 9\u00b0 from\nvertical in males and slightly greater in females).\nThe femoral condyles articulate with menisci (crescentic plates of cartilage)\nand tibial condyles to form the knee joint (Fig. 7.4). The menisci and tibial\ncondyles glide as a unit across the inferior and posterior aspects of the femoral\ncondyles during flexion and extension.

It and the\nadjacent medial surface are subcutaneous throughout their lengths and are\ncommonly known as the \u201cshin.\u201d Their periosteal covering and overlying skin are\nvulnerable to bruising. At the superior end of the anterior border, a broad, oblong\ntibial tuberosity provides distal attachment for the patellar ligament, which\nstretches between the inferior margin of the patella and the tibial tuberosity.\nThe tibial shaft is thinnest at the junction of its middle and distal thirds. The\ndistal end of the tibia is smaller than the proximal end, flaring only medially. The\nmedial expansion extends inferior to the rest of the shaft as the medial\nmalleolus. The inferior surface of the shaft and the lateral surface of the medial\nmalleolus articulate with the talus and are covered with articular cartilage (Fig.\n7.4).\nThe interosseous border of the tibia is sharp where it gives attachment to\nthe interosseous membrane that unites the two leg bones (Fig. 7.10). Inferiorly,\nthe sharp border is replaced by a groove, the fibular notch, that accommodates\nand provides fibrous attachment to the distal end of the fibula.\nOn the posterior surface of the proximal part of the tibial shaft is a rough\ndiagonal ridge, called the soleal line, which runs inferomedially to the medial\nborder. This line is formed in relationship to the aponeurotic origin of the soleus\nmuscle approximately one third of the way down the shaft. Immediately distal to\n1558"

From it, the nutrient canal runs inferiorly in the tibia\nbefore it opens into the medullary (marrow) cavity.\nFIBULA\nThe slender fibula lies posterolateral to the tibia and is firmly attached to it by\nthe tibiofibular syndesmosis, which includes the interosseous membrane (Fig.\n7.10). The fibula has no function in weight bearing. It serves mainly for muscle\nattachment, providing distal attachment (insertion) for one muscle and proximal\nattachment (origin) for eight muscles. The fibers of the tibiofibular syndesmosis\nare arranged to resist the resulting net downward pull on the fibula.\nThe distal end enlarges and is prolonged laterally and inferiorly as the\nlateral malleolus. The malleoli form the outer walls of a rectangular socket\n(mortise), which is the superior component of the ankle joint (Fig. 7.4A), and\nprovide attachment for the ligaments that stabilize the joint. The lateral malleolus\nis more prominent and posterior than the medial malleolus and extends\napproximately 1 cm more distally.\nThe proximal end of the fibula consists of an enlarged head superior to a\nsmall neck (Fig. 7.10). The head has a pointed apex and articulates with the\nfibular facet on the posterolateral, inferior aspect of the lateral tibial condyle.\nThe shaft of the fibula is twisted and marked by the sites of muscular\nattachments.

Only one bone, the talus, articulates with the leg bones.\nThe talus (L., ankle bone) has a body, neck, and head (Fig. 7.12D). The\nsuperior surface, or trochlea of the talus, is gripped by the two malleoli (Fig.\n7.4) and receives the weight of the body from the tibia.

The sustentaculum tali\n(L., talar shelf), the shelf-like support of the head of the talus, projects from the\nsuperior border of the medial surface of the calcaneus (Fig. 7.12B, E). The\nposterior part of the calcaneus has a massive, weight-bearing prominence, the\ncalcaneal tuberosity (L. tuber calcanei), which has medial, lateral, and\nanterior tubercles. Only the medial tubercle contacts the ground during\nstanding.\nThe navicular (L., little ship) is a flattened, boat-shaped bone located\nbetween the head of the talus posteriorly and the three cuneiforms anteriorly\n(Fig. 7.12). The medial surface of the navicular projects inferiorly to form the\nnavicular tuberosity, an important site for tendon attachment because the\nmedial border of the foot does not rest on the ground, as does the lateral border.\nInstead, it forms a longitudinal arch of the foot, which must be supported\ncentrally. If this tuberosity is too prominent, it may press against the medial part\nof the shoe and cause foot pain.\nThe cuboid, approximately cubical in shape, is the most lateral bone in the\ndistal row of the tarsus (Fig. 7.12A, D). Anterior to the tuberosity of the cuboid\non the lateral and inferior surfaces of the bone is a groove for the tendon of the\nfibularis (peroneus) longus muscle.\nThe three cuneiform bones (Fig. 7.12A, D, and E) are the medial (1st),\nintermediate (2nd), and lateral (3rd).

Injuries\nto the hips make up <3% of lower limb injuries. In general, most injuries result\nfrom acute trauma during contact sports such as hockey and football and from\noveruse during endurance sports such as marathon races.\nAdolescents are most vulnerable to these injuries because of the demands of\nsports on their maturing musculoskeletal systems. The cartilaginous models of\nthe bones in the developing lower limbs are transformed into bone by\nendochondral ossification (see Fig. 7.2E, F). Because the process is not\ncompleted until early adulthood, cartilaginous epiphysial plates still exist during\nthe teenage years, when physical activity often peaks and involvement in\ncompetitive sports is most common.\nThe epiphysial plates are discs of hyaline cartilage between the metaphysis\nand epiphysis of a mature long bone that permit the bone to grow longer.\nDuring growth spurts, bones actually grow faster than the attached muscle. The\ncombined stress on the epiphysial plates resulting from physical activity and\nrapid growth may result in irritation and injury of the plates and developing\n1566"

The strain may fracture the anterior cortex of the tibia. Indirect\nviolence applied to the tibial shaft when the bone turns with the foot fixed\nduring a fall may produce a fracture (e.g., when a person is tackled in football).\nIn addition, severe torsion during skiing may produce a diagonal fracture\n(Fig. B7.4C) of the tibial shaft at the junction of the middle and inferior thirds,\nas well as a fracture of the fibula. Diagonal fractures are often associated with\nlimb shortening caused by overriding of the fractured ends. Frequently during\nskiing, a fracture results from a high-speed forward fall, which angles the leg\nover the rigid ski boot, producing a \u201cboot-top fracture\u201d (Fig. B7.4D, E).\n \n  Fractures Involving Epiphysial\nPlates\nThe primary ossification center for the superior end of the tibia appears shortly\nafter birth and joins the shaft of the tibia during adolescence (usually 16\u201318\nyears of age). Tibial fractures in children are more serious if they involve the\nepiphysial plates because continued normal growth of the bone may be\njeopardized. The tibial tuberosity usually forms by inferior bone growth from\nthe superior epiphysial center at approximately 10 years of age, but a separate\ncenter for the tibial tuberosity may appear at approximately 12 years of age.\nDisruption of the epiphysial plate at the tibial tuberosity may cause\ninflammation of the tuberosity and chronic recurring pain during adolescence\n(Osgood-Schlatter disease), especially in young athletes (Fig. B7.5).\n1575"

This is possible\nbecause the blood received by the saphenous veins is continuously shunted from\nthese superficial veins in the subcutaneous tissue to the deep veins internal to the\ndeep fascia by means of many perforating veins.\nThe perforating veins penetrate the deep fascia close to their origin from the\nsuperficial veins and contain valves that allow blood to flow only from the\nsuperficial veins to the deep veins (Fig. 7.15A, D). The perforating veins pass\nthrough the deep fascia at an oblique angle so that when muscles contract and the\npressure increases inside the deep fascia, the perforating veins are compressed.\nCompression of these veins also prevents blood from flowing from the deep to\nthe superficial veins. This pattern of venous blood flow\u2014from superficial to\ndeep\u2014is important for proper venous return from the lower limb because it\nenables muscular contractions to propel blood toward the heart against gravity\n(musculovenous pump; see Fig. 1.26 in Chapter 1, Overview and Basic\nConcepts).\nDEEP VEINS OF LOWER LIMB\nDeep veins accompany all the major arteries and their branches.

Medial and lateral plantar veins from\nthe plantar aspect of the foot form the posterior tibial and fibular veins\nposterior to the medial and lateral malleoli (Fig. 7.15C\u2013E). All three deep veins\nfrom the leg flow into the popliteal vein posterior to the knee, which becomes\nthe femoral vein in the thigh. Veins accompanying the perforating arteries of the\nprofunda femoris vein drain blood from the thigh muscles and terminate in the\nprofunda femoris vein (deep vein of thigh), which joins the terminal portion of\nthe femoral vein (Fig. 7.15C, E). The femoral vein passes deep to the inguinal\nligament to become the external iliac vein.\nBecause of the effect of gravity, blood flow is slower when a person stands\nquietly. During exercise, blood received by the deep veins from the superficial\nveins is propelled by muscular contraction to the femoral and then the external\niliac veins. Flow in the reverse direction is prevented if the valves are competent.\nThe deep veins are more variable and anastomose much more frequently than the\narteries they accompany. Both superficial and deep veins can be ligated if\nnecessary.\nLymphatic Drainage of Lower Limb\nThe lower limb has superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial\nlymphatic vessels converge on and accompany the saphenous veins and their\ntributaries (Fig. 7.16A). The lymphatic vessels accompanying the great\nsaphenous vein end in the vertical group of superficial inguinal lymph nodes.\nMost lymph from these nodes passes directly to the external iliac lymph nodes,\nlocated along the external iliac vein. Some lymph also passes to the deep\ninguinal lymph nodes, located under the deep fascia on the medial aspect of the\nfemoral vein. The lymphatic vessels accompanying the small saphenous vein\nenter the popliteal lymph nodes, which surround the popliteal vein in the fat of\nthe popliteal fossa (Fig. 7.16B).\nDeep lymphatic vessels from the leg accompany deep veins and also enter\nthe popliteal lymph nodes. Most lymph from these nodes ascends through deep\nlymphatic vessels to the deep inguinal lymph nodes. Lymph from the deep nodes\npasses to the external and common iliac lymph nodes and then enters the lumbar\nlymphatic trunks (Fig. 7.16C).\n1595"

The swing phase occupies approximately\n40% of the walking cycle and the stance phase, 60%. The stance phase of\nwalking is longer than the swing phase because it begins and ends with relatively\nshort periods (each 10% of the cycle) of double support (both feet are contacting\nthe ground) as the weight is transferred from one side to the other, with a more\nextended period of single support (only one foot on the ground bearing all body\nweight) in between as the contralateral limb swings forward. In running, there is\nno period of double support; consequently, the time and percentage of the gait\ncycle represented by the stance phase are reduced.\nWalking is a remarkably efficient activity, taking advantage of gravity and\nmomentum so that a minimum of physical exertion is required. Most energy is\nused (1) in the eccentric contraction of the dorsiflexors during the beginning\n(loading response) phase of stance (Fig. 7.21B) as the heel is lowered to the\nground following heel strike and (2) especially at the end of stance (terminal\nstance; Fig. 7.21D) as the plantarflexors concentrically contract, pushing the\nforefoot (metatarsals and phalanges) down to produce push off, thus providing\nmost of the propulsive force.\nDuring the last part of the stance phase (push off or toe off; Fig. 7.21E), the\ntoes flex to grip the ground and augment the push off initiated from the ball of\nthe foot (sole underlying the heads of the medial two metatarsals). The long\nflexors and intrinsic muscles of the foot stabilize the forefoot and toes so that the\neffect of plantarflexion at the ankle and flexion of the toes is maximized.\nThe swing phase also involves flexion of the hip so that the free limb\naccelerates faster than the forward movement of the body. During initial swing\n(Fig. 7.21F), the knee flexes almost simultaneously, owing to momentum\n(without expenditure of energy), followed by dorsiflexion (lifting the forefoot\nup) at the ankle joint. The latter two movements have the effect of shortening the\nfree limb so that it will clear the ground as it swings forward. By midswing,\n1610"

Because the unsupported side of the hip tends to drop\nduring the swing phase (which would negate the effect of limb shortening),\nabductor muscles on the supported side contract strongly during the single\nsupport part of the stance phase (Fig. 7.21F, G), pulling on the fixed femur to\nresist the tilting and keep the pelvis level. The same muscles also rotate\n(advance) the contralateral side of the pelvis forward, concurrent with the swing\nof its free limb.\nOf course, all these actions alternate from side to side with each step. The\nextensors of the hip normally make only minor contributions to level walking.\nPrimarily, the hip is passively extended by momentum during stance, except\nwhen accelerating or walking fast, and becomes increasingly active with increase\nin slope (steepness) during walking uphill or upstairs. Concentric hip flexion and\nknee extension are used during the swing phase of level walking and so are not\nweight-bearing actions; however, they are affected by body weight when their\neccentric contraction is necessary for deceleration or walking downhill or\ndownstairs.\nStabilization and resilience are important during locomotion. The invertors\nand evertors of the foot are principal stabilizers of the foot during the stance\nphase.

            "Text": "Organization of Proximal Lower Limb\nDuring evolution, the development of a prominent gluteal region is closely\nassociated with the assumption of bipedalism and an erect posture. The\nprominent gluteal region is unique to humans. Modification of the shape of the\nfemur necessary for bipedal walking and running (specifically the \u201cbending\u201d of\nthe bone, creating the angle of inclination and the trochanters) allows the\nsuperior placement of the abductors of the thigh into the gluteal region.\nThe remaining thigh muscles are organized into three compartments by\nintermuscular septa that pass deeply between the muscle groups from the inner\nsurface of the fascia lata to the linea aspera of the femur (see Fig. 7.14D). The\ncompartments are anterior or extensor, medial or adductor, and posterior or\nflexor, so named on the basis of their location or action at the knee joint.\nGenerally, the anterior group is innervated by the femoral nerve, the medial\ngroup by the obturator nerve, and the posterior group by the tibial portion of the\nsciatic nerve. Although the compartments vary in absolute and relative size\ndepending on the level, the anterior compartment is the largest overall and\nincludes the femur.\nTo facilitate continuity and follow an approach commonly used in dissection\ncourses, the anterior and medial compartments of the thigh are addressed\ninitially, followed by continuous examination of the posterior aspect of the\nproximal limb: gluteal region and posterior thigh. This approach is then\ncontinued by consideration of the popliteal fossa and leg.\nAnterior Thigh Muscles\nThe large anterior compartment of the thigh contains the anterior thigh\nmuscles, the flexors of the hip (Fig. 7.22A\u2013D) and extensors of the knee (Fig.\n7.22E\u2013I). For attachments, nerve supply, and main actions of these muscles, see\nTables 7.3.I and 7.3.II.

Damage to one or more of the listed spinal cord segments or to the motor\nnerve roots arising from them results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.\nThe major muscles of the anterior compartment tend to atrophy (diminish)\nrapidly with disease, and physical therapy is often necessary to restore strength,\ntone, and symmetry with the opposite limb after immobilization of the thigh or\nleg.\nPECTINEUS\nThe pectineus is a flat quadrangular muscle located in the anterior part of the\nsuperomedial aspect of the thigh (Fig. 7.22A, B; Table 7.3.I). It often appears to\nbe composed of two layers, superficial and deep, and these are generally\ninnervated by two different nerves. Because of the dual nerve supply and the\nmuscle\u2019s actions (the pectineus adducts and flexes the thigh and assists in medial\nrotation of the thigh), it is actually a transitional muscle between the anterior and\nmedial compartments.\nILIOPSOAS\nThe iliopsoas, the chief flexor of the thigh, is the most powerful of the hip\nflexors with the longest range. Although it is one of the body\u2019s most powerful\nmuscles, it is relatively hidden, with most of its mass located in the posterior\nwall of the abdomen and greater pelvis. Its broad lateral part, the iliacus, and its\nlong medial part, the psoas major, arise from the iliac fossa and lumbar\nvertebrae, respectively (Fig. 7.22C; Table 7.3.I). Thus, it is the only muscle\nattached to the vertebral column, pelvis, and femur. It is in a unique position not\nonly to produce movement but to stabilize (fixate). However, it can also\nperpetuate and even contribute to deformity and disability when it is malformed\n(especially if it is shortened), dysfunctional, or diseased.\nConcentric contraction of the iliopsoas typically moves the free limb,\nproducing flexion at the hip to lift the limb and initiate its forward swing during\nwalking (i.e., during the preswing and initial swing phases) as the opposite limb\naccepts weight (Fig. 7.21E, F) or to elevate the limb during climbing. However,\nit is also capable of moving the trunk. Bilateral contraction of the iliopsoas\nmuscles initiates flexion of the trunk at the hip on the fixed thigh\u2014as when\n1615"

It passes lateral to medial across the supero-anterior part of the thigh\n(Fig. 7.22D; Table 7.3.I). The sartorius lies superficially in the anterior\ncompartment, within its own relatively distinct fascial sheath. It descends\ninferiorly as far as the medial side of the knee.\nThe sartorius, the longest muscle in the body, acts across two joints. It flexes\nthe hip joint and participates in flexion of the knee joint. It also weakly abducts\nthe thigh and laterally rotates it. The actions of both sartorius muscles bring the\nlower limbs into the cross-legged sitting position. None of the actions of the\nsartorius is strong; therefore, it is mainly a synergist, acting with other thigh\nmuscles that produce these movements.\nQUADRICEPS FEMORIS\nThe quadriceps femoris (L., four-headed femoral muscle) forms the main bulk\nof the anterior thigh muscles and collectively constitutes the largest and one of\nthe most powerful muscles in the body. It covers almost all the anterior aspect\nand sides of the femur (Fig. 7.22E\u2013I). The quadriceps femoris (usually shortened\nto quadriceps) consists of four parts: (1) rectus femoris, (2) vastus lateralis, (3)\nvastus intermedius, and (4) vastus medialis. Collectively, the quadriceps is a\ntwo-joint muscle capable of producing action at both the hip and knee.\nThe quadriceps is the great extensor of the leg. Concentric contraction of the\nquadriceps to extend the knee against gravity is important during rising from\nsitting or squatting, during climbing and walking up stairs, and for acceleration\nand projection (running and jumping) when it is lifting or moving the body\u2019s\nweight. Consequently, it may be three times stronger than its antagonistic muscle\ngroup, the hamstrings.\nIn level walking, the quadriceps muscles become active during the\n1616"

The quadriceps is primarily responsible for absorbing the jarring\nshock of heel strike, and its activity continues as the weight is assumed during\nthe early stance phase (loading response). It also functions as a fixator during\nbent-knee sports, such as skiing and tennis, and contracts eccentrically during\ndownhill walking and descending stairs.\nThe tendons of the four parts of the quadriceps unite in the distal portion of\nthe thigh to form a single, strong, broad quadriceps tendon (Fig. 7.22F). The\npatellar ligament (L. ligamentum patellae) is the continuation of the quadriceps\ntendon in which the patella, the largest sesamoid bone in the body, is embedded.\nDistally, the patellar ligament is attached to the tibial tuberosity.\nThe medial and lateral vasti muscles also attach independently to the patella\nand form aponeuroses, the medial and lateral patellar retinacula, which\nreinforce the joint capsule of the knee joint on each side of the patella en route to\nattachment to the anterior border of the tibial plateau. The retinacula also play a\nrole in keeping the patella aligned over the patellar surface of the femur.\nThe patella provides a bony surface that is able to withstand the\ncompression placed on the quadriceps tendon during kneeling and the friction\noccurring when the knee is flexed and extended during running. The patella also\nprovides additional leverage for the quadriceps in placing the tendon more\nanteriorly, farther from the joint\u2019s axis, causing it to approach the tibia from a\nposition of greater mechanical advantage. The inferiorly directed apex of the\npatella indicates the level of the joint plane of the knee when the leg is extended\nand the patellar ligament is taut (Fig. 7.23C).\nFIGURE 7.23.

We are providing only\na few important examples useful to primary care health professionals.\nRectus Femoris. The rectus femoris received its name because it runs straight\ndown the thigh (L. rectus, straight). Because of its attachments to the hip bone\nand tibia via the patellar ligament (Fig. 7.22E, F), it crosses two joints; hence, it\nis capable of flexing the thigh at the hip joint and extending the leg at the knee\njoint. The rectus femoris is the only part of the quadriceps that crosses the hip\njoint, and as a hip flexor, it acts with and like the iliopsoas during the preswing\nand initial swing phases of walking (Fig. 7.22F; Table 7.2).\nThe ability of the rectus femoris to extend the knee is compromised during\nhip flexion, but it does contribute to the extension force during the toe off phase\nof walking, when the thigh is extended. It is particularly efficient in movements\ncombining knee extension and hip flexion from a position of hip hyperextension\nand knee flexion, as in the preparatory position for kicking a soccer ball. The\nrectus femoris is susceptible to injury and avulsion from the anterior inferior iliac\nspine during kicking, hence the name \u201ckicking muscle.\u201d A loss of function of the\nrectus femoris may reduce thigh flexion strength by as much as 17%.\nVastus Muscles. The names of the three large vastus muscles (pl., vasti)\nindicate their position around the femoral shaft (Fig. 7.22E\u2013I; Table 7.3.II):\nVastus lateralis, the largest component of the quadriceps, lies on the lateral\nside of the thigh.\nVastus medialis covers the medial side of the thigh.\nVastus intermedius lies deep to the rectus femoris, between the vastus\nmedialis and vastus lateralis.\n1618"

Three adductors (longus, brevis,\nand magnus) are used in all movements in which the thighs are adducted (e.g.,\npressed together when riding a horse).\nThey are also used to stabilize the stance when standing on both feet, to\ncorrect a lateral sway of the trunk, or when there is a side-to-side shift of the\nsurface on which one is standing (rocking a boat, standing on a balance board).\nThese muscles are also used in kicking with the medial side of the foot in soccer\nand in swimming. Finally, they contribute to flexion of the extended thigh and\nextension of the flexed thigh when running or against resistance.\nThe adductors as a group constitute a large muscle mass. Although they are\nimportant in many activities, it has been shown that a reduction of as much as\n70% in their function will result in only a slight to moderate impairment of hip\nfunction (Markhede and Stener, 1981).\nTesting of the medial thigh muscles is performed while the person is lying\nsupine with the knee straight. The individual adducts the thigh against resistance,\nand if the adductors are normal, the proximal ends of the gracilis and adductor\nlongus can easily be palpated.\nADDUCTOR HIATUS\nThe adductor hiatus is an opening or aperture between the aponeurotic distal\nattachment of the adductor part of the adductor magnus and the tendinous distal\nattachment of the hamstring part (Fig. 7.24E). The adductor hiatus transmits the\nfemoral artery and vein from the adductor canal in the thigh to the popliteal fossa\nposterior to the knee. The opening is located just lateral and superior to the\nadductor tubercle of the femur.\nNeurovascular Structures and Relationships in\n1624"

Such an\nabscess may be palpated or observed in the inguinal region, just inferior or\nsuperior to the inguinal ligament, and may be mistaken for an indirect inguinal\nhernia or a femoral hernia, an enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes, or a\nsaphenous varix. The lateral border of the psoas is commonly visible in\nradiographs of the abdomen; an obscured psoas shadow may be an indication of\nabdominal pathology.\n Paralysis of Quadriceps\nA person with paralyzed quadriceps muscles cannot extend the leg against\nresistance. They commonly walk with a forward lean, pressing on the distal end\nof the thigh with their hand as the heel contacts the ground to prevent\ninadvertent flexion of the knee joint.\nWeakness of the vastus medialis or vastus lateralis, resulting from arthritis\nor trauma to the knee joint, can result in abnormal patellar movement and loss\nof joint stability.\n1640"

In the superior part of its course, the sciatic nerve passes deep to the\ngluteus maximus (Fig. 7.36).\nThe main actions of the gluteus maximus are extension and lateral rotation of\nthe thigh. When the distal attachment of the gluteus maximus is fixed, the\nmuscle extends the trunk on the lower limb. Although it is the strongest extensor\nof the hip, it acts mostly when force is necessary (rapid movement or movement\nagainst resistance). The gluteus maximus functions primarily between the flexed\nand standing (straight) positions of the thigh, as when rising from the sitting\nposition, straightening from the bending position, walking uphill and upstairs,\nand running. It is used only briefly during casual walking and usually not at all\n1658"

If you climb stairs and put your hands on your buttocks, you will feel the\ngluteus maximus contract strongly.\nBecause the iliotibial tract crosses the knee and attaches to the anterolateral\ntubercle of the tibia (Gerdy) (Figs. 7.35J and 7.37A, B), the gluteus maximus\nand tensor fasciae latae together are also able to assist in making the extended\nknee stable, but they are not usually called on to do so during normal standing.\nBecause the iliotibial tract attaches to the femur via the lateral intermuscular\nseptum, it does not have the freedom necessary to produce motion at the knee.\nTesting the gluteus maximus is performed when the person is prone with the\nlower limb straight.

The gluteus medius can be palpated\ninferior to the iliac crest, posterior to the tensor fasciae latae, which is also\ncontracting during abduction of the thigh.\nTENSOR FASCIAE LATAE\nThe tensor fasciae latae is a fusiform muscle approximately 15 cm long that is\nenclosed between two layers of fascia lata (Figs. 7.35C, J, 7.37, and 7.38). Its\nattachments, innervation, and action are provided in Table 7.6.\nThe tensor fasciae latae and the superficial and anterior part of the gluteus\nmaximus share a common distal attachment to the anterolateral tubercle of the\ntibia via the iliotibial tract, which acts as a long aponeurosis for the muscles.\nHowever, unlike the gluteus maximus, the tensor fasciae latae is served by the\nsuperior gluteal neurovascular bundle. Despite its gluteal innervation and shared\nattachment, this tensor is primarily a flexor of the thigh because of its anterior\nlocation; however, it generally does not act independently.\nTo produce flexion, the tensor fasciae latae acts in concert with the iliopsoas\nand rectus femoris. When the iliopsoas is paralyzed, the tensor fasciae latae\nundergoes hypertrophy in an attempt to compensate for the paralysis. It also\nworks in conjunction with other abductor/medial rotator muscles (gluteus medius\nand minimus) (Fig. 7.40).

The rounded common tendon\nof these heads attaches to the head of the fibula and can easily be seen and felt as\nit passes the knee, especially when the knee is flexed against resistance.\nThe long head of the biceps femoris crosses and provides protection for the\nsciatic nerve after it descends from the gluteal region into the posterior aspect of\nthe thigh (Figs. 7.39A and 7.42A\u2013C). When the sciatic nerve divides into its\nterminal branches, the lateral branch (common fibular nerve) continues this\nrelationship, running with the biceps tendon.\nThe short head of the biceps femoris arises from the lateral lip of the\ninferior third of the linea aspera and supracondylar ridge of the femur (Fig.\n7.41B, H). Whereas the hamstrings have a common nerve supply from the tibial\ndivision of the sciatic nerve, the short head of the biceps is innervated by the\nfibular division (Table 7.7). Because each of the two heads of the biceps femoris\nhas a different nerve supply, a wound in the posterior thigh with nerve injury\nmay paralyze one head and not the other.\nWhen the knee is flexed to 90\u00b0, the tendons of the lateral hamstring (biceps),\nas well as the iliotibial tract, pass to the lateral side of the tibia.

These superficial nerves supply the\nskin over the iliac crest, between the posterior superior iliac spines, and over the\niliac tubercles. Consequently, these nerves are vulnerable to injury when bone is\ntaken from the ilium for grafting.\nDEEP GLUTEAL NERVES\nThe deep gluteal nerves are the superior and inferior gluteal nerves, sciatic\nnerve, nerve to quadratus femoris, posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, nerve\nto obturator internus, and pudendal nerve (Figs. 7.39A and 7.43; Table 7.8). All\nof these nerves are branches of the sacral plexus and leave the pelvis through the\ngreater sciatic foramen. Except for the superior gluteal nerve, they all emerge\ninferior to the piriformis.\nSuperior Gluteal Nerve. The superior gluteal nerve runs laterally between\nthe gluteus medius and minimus with the deep branch of the superior gluteal\nartery. It divides into a superior branch that supplies the gluteus medius and an\ninferior branch that continues to pass between the gluteus medius and the gluteus\nminimus to supply both muscles and the tensor fasciae latae.\nSee the clinical box \u201cInjury to Superior Gluteal Nerve.\u201d\nInferior Gluteal Nerve. The inferior gluteal nerve leaves the pelvis\nthrough the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis and superficial to\nthe sciatic nerve, accompanied by multiple branches of the inferior gluteal artery\nand vein. The inferior gluteal nerve also divides into several branches, which\nprovide motor innervation to the overlying gluteus maximus.\n1675"

The sciatic nerve is the most lateral structure\nemerging through the greater sciatic foramen inferior to the piriformis.\nMedial to the sciatic nerve are the inferior gluteal nerve and vessels, the\ninternal pudendal vessels, and the pudendal nerve. The sciatic nerve runs\ninferolaterally under cover of the gluteus maximus, midway between the greater\ntrochanter and ischial tuberosity. The nerve rests on the ischium and then passes\nposterior to the obturator internus, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus\nmuscles. The sciatic nerve is so large that it receives a named branch of the\ninferior gluteal artery, the artery to the sciatic nerve.\nThe sciatic nerve supplies no structures in the gluteal region. It supplies the\nposterior thigh muscles, all leg and foot muscles, and the skin of most of the leg\nand foot. It also supplies the articular branches to all joints of the lower limb.\nThe sciatic nerve is really two nerves, the tibial nerve, derived from anterior\n(preaxial) divisions of the anterior rami, and the common fibular nerve, derived\nfrom posterior (postaxial) divisions of the anterior rami, which are loosely bound\ntogether in the same connective tissue sheath (Figs. 7.43 and 7.44A).\n1676"

In these cases, the tibial nerve passes inferior\nto the piriformis, and the common fibular nerve pierces this muscle or passes\nsuperior to it (Fig. 7.44B, C).\nNerve to Quadratus Femoris. The nerve to the quadratus femoris leaves the\npelvis anterior to the sciatic nerve and obturator internus and passes over the\nposterior surface of the hip joint (Fig. 7.43). It supplies an articular branch to this\njoint and innervates the inferior gemellus and quadratus femoris muscles.\nPosterior Cutaneous Nerve of Thigh. The posterior cutaneous nerve of\nthe thigh supplies more skin than any other cutaneous nerve (Fig. 7.43). Its\nfibers from the anterior divisions of S2 and S3 supply the skin of the perineum\nvia its perineal branch. Some of the fibers from the posterior divisions of the\nanterior rami of S1 and S2 supply the skin of the inferior part of the buttocks (via\nthe inferior clunial nerves). Other fibers continue inferiorly in branches that\nsupply the skin of the posterior thigh and proximal part of the leg. Unlike most\nnerves bearing the name cutaneous, the main part of this nerve lies deep to the\ndeep fascia (fascia lata), with only its terminal branches penetrating the\nsubcutaneous tissue for distribution to the skin.\nPudendal Nerve. The pudendal nerve is the most medial structure to exit the\npelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It descends inferior to the piriformis,\nposterolateral to the sacrospinous ligament, and enters the perineum through the\nlesser sciatic foramen to supply structures in this region. The pudendal nerve\nsupplies no structures in the gluteal region or posterior thigh and is discussed in\ndetail in Chapter 3, Upper Limb.\nNerve to Obturator Internus.

The superficial branch supplies the gluteus maximus and skin\nover the proximal attachment of this muscle. The deep branch supplies the\ngluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. The superior gluteal\nartery anastomoses with the inferior gluteal and medial circumflex femoral\narteries.\nInferior Gluteal Artery. The inferior gluteal artery arises from the internal\niliac artery and passes posteriorly through the parietal pelvic fascia, between the\nS1 and the S2 (or S2 and S3) nerves.

They perforate the aponeurotic portion of the distal\nattachment of the adductor magnus to enter the posterior compartment. Within\nthe posterior compartment, they typically give rise to muscular branches to the\nhamstrings and anastomotic branches that ascend or descend to unite with those\narising superiorly or inferiorly from the other perforating arteries or the inferior\ngluteal and popliteal artery.\nA continuous anastomotic arterial chain thus extends from the gluteal to\npopliteal regions, which gives rise to additional branches to muscles and to the\nsciatic nerve.

The violent muscular exertion\nrequired to excel in these sports may avulse (tear) part of the proximal\ntendinous attachments of the hamstrings to the ischial tuberosity. Hamstring\nstrains are twice as common as quadriceps strains.\nUsually, thigh strains are accompanied by contusion (bruising) and tearing\nof muscle fibers, resulting in rupture of the blood vessels supplying the muscles.\nThe resultant hematoma is contained by the dense stocking-like fascia lata.\nTearing of hamstring fibers is often so painful when the athlete moves or\nstretches the leg that the person falls and writhes in pain. These injuries often\nresult from inadequate warming up before practice or competition.\nAvulsion (tearing away) of the ischial tuberosity at the proximal attachment\nof the biceps femoris and semitendinosus may result from forcible flexion of the\nhip with the knee extended (e.g., kicking a football).

Immediately after, in the\nstance phase, eccentric contraction of the tibialis anterior controls the lowering\nof the forefoot to the floor following heel strike (see Fig. 7.21A and Table 7.2).\nThe latter is important to a smooth gait and is important to deceleration (braking)\nrelative to running and walking downhill. During standing, the dorsiflexors\nreflexively pull the leg (and thus the center of gravity) anteriorly on the fixed\nfoot when the body starts to lean (the center of gravity begins to shift too far)\nposteriorly. When descending a slope, especially if the surface is loose (sand,\ngravel, or snow), dorsiflexion is used to \u201cdig in\u201d one\u2019s heels.\nTibialis Anterior. The tibialis anterior (TA), the most medial and\nsuperficial dorsiflexor, is a slender muscle that lies against the lateral surface of\nthe tibia (Figs. 7.54 and 7.57). The long tendon of TA begins halfway down the\nleg and descends along the anterior surface of the tibia. Its tendon passes within\nits own synovial sheath deep to the superior and inferior extensor retinacula (Fig.\n7.55) to its attachment on the medial side of the foot. In so doing, its tendon is\nlocated farthest from the axis of the ankle joint, giving it the most mechanical\nadvantage and making it the strongest dorsiflexor. Although antagonists at the\nankle joint, TA and the tibialis posterior (in the posterior compartment) both\ncross the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints to attach to the medial border of the\nfoot.

The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) is the\nmost lateral of the anterior leg muscles (Figs. 7.54 to 7.57). A small part of the\nproximal attachment of the muscle is to the lateral tibial condyle; however, most\nof it attaches to the medial surface of the fibula and the superior part of the\nanterior surface of the interosseous membrane (Fig. 7.56A; Table 7.10).\nThe EDL becomes tendinous superior to the ankle, forming four tendons that\nattach to the phalanges of the lateral four toes. A common synovial sheath\nsurrounds the four tendons of the EDL (plus that of the fibularis tertius) as they\ndiverge on the dorsum of the foot and pass to their distal attachments (Fig.\n7.55B).\nEach tendon of EDL forms a membranous extensor expansion (dorsal\naponeurosis) over the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the toe, which divides\ninto two lateral bands and one central band (Fig. 7.55A). The central band inserts\ninto the base of the middle phalanx, and the lateral slips converge to insert into\nthe base of the distal phalanx.\nTo test the EDL, the lateral four toes are dorsiflexed against resistance; if\nacting normally, the tendons can be seen and palpated.\nFibularis Tertius. The fibularis tertius (FT) is a separated part of EDL,\nwhich shares its synovial sheath (Figs. 7.55 and 7.57). Proximally, the\nattachments and fleshy parts of the EDL and FT are continuous; however,\ndistally, the FT tendon is separate and attaches to the 5th metatarsal, not to a\nphalanx (Fig. 7.56F; Table 7.10). Although FT contributes (weakly) to\ndorsiflexion, it also acts at the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints, contributing\nto eversion (pronation) of the foot. It may play a special proprioceptive role in\nsensing sudden inversion and then contracting reflexively to protect the anterior\ntibiofibular ligament, the most commonly sprained ligament of the body. FT is\nnot always present.\nExtensor Hallucis Longus.

These muscles are\nstrong and heavy because they lift, propel, and accelerate the weight of the body\nwhen walking, running, jumping, or standing on the toes.\nThe calcaneal tendon (L. tendo calcaneus, Achilles tendon) is the most\npowerful (thickest and strongest) tendon in the body. Approximately 15 cm in\nlength, it is a continuation of the flat aponeurosis formed halfway down the calf\nwhere the bellies of the gastrocnemius terminate (Figs. 7.62D, E and 7.63).\nProximally, the aponeurosis receives fleshy fibers of the soleus directly on its\ndeep surface, but distally, the soleus fibers become tendinous. The tendon thus\nbecomes thicker (deeper) but narrower as it descends until it becomes essentially\nround in cross-section superior to the calcaneus. It then widens as it inserts on\nthe posterior surface of the calcaneal tuberosity. The calcaneal tendon typically\nspirals a quarter turn (90\u00b0) during its descent, so that the gastrocnemius fibers\nattach laterally and the soleal fibers attach medially. This arrangement is thought\nto be significant to the tendon\u2019s elastic ability to absorb energy (shock) and\nrecoil, releasing the energy as part of the propulsive force it exerts. Although\nthey share a common tendon, the two muscles of the triceps surae are capable of\nacting alone, and often do so: \u201cYou stroll with the soleus but win the long jump\nwith the gastrocnemius.\u201d\nTo test the triceps surae, the foot is plantarflexed against resistance (e.g., by\n\u201cstanding on the toes,\u201d in which case body weight [gravity] provides resistance).\nIf normal, the calcaneal tendon and triceps surae can be observed and palpated.\nA subcutaneous calcaneal bursa, located between the skin and the calcaneal\ntendon, allows the skin to move over the taut tendon. A deep bursa of the\ncalcaneal tendon (retrocalcaneal bursa), located between the tendon and the\ncalcaneus, allows the tendon to glide over the bone.\nGastrocnemius. The gastrocnemius is the most superficial muscle in the\nposterior compartment and forms the proximal, most prominent part of the calf\n(Figs. 7.62D and 7.63A; Table 7.13.I). It is a fusiform, two-headed, two-joint\n1723"

The heads come together at the inferior margin of the popliteal\nfossa, where they form the inferolateral and inferomedial boundaries of this\nfossa. Because its fibers are largely of the white, fast-twitch (type 2) variety,\ncontractions of the gastrocnemius produce rapid movements during running and\njumping. It is recruited into action only intermittently during symmetrical\nstanding.\nThe gastrocnemius crosses and is capable of acting on both the knee and the\nankle joints; however, it cannot exert its full power on both joints at the same\ntime. It functions most effectively when the knee is extended (and is maximally\nactivated when knee extension is combined with dorsiflexion, as in the sprint\nstart). It is incapable of producing plantarflexion when the knee is fully flexed.\nSoleus. The soleus is located deep to the gastrocnemius and is the\n\u201cworkhorse\u201d of plantarflexion (Figs. 7.62E and 7.63A, B; Table 7.13.I). It is a\nlarge muscle, flatter than the gastrocnemius, that is named for its resemblance to\na sole\u2014the flat fish that reclines on its side on the sea floor. The soleus has a\ncontinuous proximal attachment in the shape of an inverted U to the posterior\naspects of the fibula and tibia and a tendinous arch between them, the tendinous\narch of soleus (L. arcus tendineus soleus) (Figs. 7.62A and 7.63B). The\npopliteal artery and tibial nerve exit the popliteal fossa by passing through this\narch, the popliteal artery simultaneously bifurcating into its terminal branches,\nthe anterior and posterior tibial arteries.\nThe soleus can be palpated on each side of the gastrocnemius when the\nindividual is \u201cstanding on their toes\u201d (weight on forefoot with ankle\nplantarflexed, as in Fig. 7.65A). The soleus may act with the gastrocnemius in\nplantarflexing the ankle joint; it cannot act on the knee joint and acts alone to\nproduce plantarflexion when the knee is flexed (e.g., doing a squat or \u201cduck\nwalk\u201d). Soleus has many parts, each with fiber bundles coursing in different\ndirection.\n1724"

Electromyography (EMG) studies show that during\nsymmetrical standing, the soleus is continuously active.\nPlantaris. The plantaris is a small muscle with a short belly and a long tendon\n(Figs. 7.51, 7.52, 7.54A, and 7.62A, E; Table 7.13.I). This vestigial muscle is\nabsent in 5\u201310% of people and is highly variable in size and form when present\n(most commonly a tapering slip about the size of the small finger). It acts with\nthe gastrocnemius but is insignificant as either a flexor of the knee or a\nplantarflexor of the ankle.\nThe plantaris has been considered to be an organ of proprioception for the\nlarger plantarflexors, as it has a high density of muscle spindles (receptors for\nproprioception). Its long, slender tendon is easily mistaken for a nerve (and\nhence dubbed by some as the \u201cfreshman\u2019s nerve\u201d).\nThe plantaris tendon runs distally between the gastrocnemius and soleus\n(Figs. 7.54A and 7.62B) and occasionally suddenly ruptures with a painful pop\nduring activities such as racquet sports. Because of its minor role, the plantaris\ntendon can be removed for grafting (e.g., during reconstructive surgery of the\ntendons of the hand) without causing disability.\nDEEP MUSCLE GROUP IN POSTERIOR\nCOMPARTMENT\nFour muscles make up the deep group in the posterior compartment of the leg\n(Figs. 7.54, 7.63B, 7.64 to 7.66; Table 7.13.II): popliteus, flexor digitorum\nlongus, flexor hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior. The popliteus acts on the\nknee joint, whereas the other muscles plantarflex the ankle with two continuing\non to flex the toes. However, because of their smaller size and the close\nproximity of their tendons to the axis of the ankle joint, the \u201cnontriceps\u201d\nplantarflexors collectively produce only about 7% of the total force of\nplantarflexion, and in this, the fibularis longus and brevis are most significant.\nWhen the calcaneal tendon is ruptured, these muscles cannot generate the power\nnecessary to lift the body\u2019s weight (i.e., to stand on the toes).\n1726"

Damage to one or more of the listed spinal cord segments or\nto the motor nerve roots arising from them results in paralysis of the muscles concerned.\nThe two muscles of the posterior compartment that pass to the toes are\ncrisscrossed\u2014that is, the muscle attaching medially to the great toe (flexor\nhallucis longus) arises laterally (from the fibula) in the deep subcompartment,\nand the muscle attaching to the lateral four toes (flexor digitorum longus) arises\nmedially (from the tibia) (Figs. 5.60A, G, I; and 5.63B). Their tendons cross in\nthe sole of the foot.\nPopliteus. The popliteus is a thin, triangular muscle that forms the inferior part\nof the floor of the popliteal fossa (Figs. 7.51, 7.52, 7.62A, F, and 7.64; Table\n7.13.II). Proximally, its tendinous attachment to the lateral aspect of the lateral\nfemoral condyle and its broader attachment to the lateral meniscus occur\nbetween the fibrous layer and the synovial membrane of the joint capsule of the\nknee. The apex of its fleshy belly emerges from the joint capsule of the knee\njoint. It has a fleshy distal attachment to the tibia that is covered by investing\nfascia reinforced by a fibrous expansion from the semimembranosus muscle\n(investing fascia of popliteus; Fig. 7.64).\nThe popliteus is insignificant as a flexor of the knee joint per se; but during\nflexion at the knee, it assists in pulling the lateral meniscus of the knee joint\nposteriorly, a movement otherwise produced passively by compression (as it is\nfor the medial meniscus). When a person is standing with the knee partly flexed,\nthe popliteus contracts to assist the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in\npreventing anterior displacement of the femur on the inclined tibial plateau (see\nFig. 7.91C).\n1729"

When\nstanding with the knees locked in the fully extended position, the popliteus acts\nto rotate the femur laterally 5\u00b0 on the tibial plateaus, releasing the knee from its\nclose-packed or locked position so that flexion can occur. When the foot is off\nthe ground and the knee is flexed, the popliteus can aid the medial hamstrings\n(the \u201csemi-muscles\u201d) in rotating the tibia medially beneath the femoral condyles.\nFlexor Hallucis Longus. The flexor hallucis longus (FHL) is a powerful\nflexor of all of the joints of the great toe (Fig. 7.65A, B). Immediately after the\ntriceps surae has delivered the thrust of plantarflexion to the ball of the foot (the\nprominence of the sole underlying the heads of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals), the\nFHL delivers a final thrust via flexion of the great toe for the preswing phase\n(toe off) of the gait cycle (see Fig. 7.21E; Table 7.2). When barefoot, this thrust\nis delivered by the great toe; but with soled shoes on, it becomes part of the\nthrust of plantarflexion delivered by the forefoot.\nThe tendon of the FHL passes posterior to the distal end of the tibia and\noccupies a shallow groove on the posterior surface of the talus, which is\ncontinuous with the groove on the plantar surface of the sustentaculum tali (Figs.\n7.62H\u2013K and 7.65A, B; Table 7.13.II). The tendon then crosses deep to the\ntendon of the flexor digitorum longus in the sole of the foot. As it passes to the\ndistal phalanx of the great toe, the FHL tendon runs between two sesamoid\nbones in the tendons of the flexor hallucis brevis (Fig. 7.65B). These bones\nprotect the tendon from the pressure of the head of the 1st metatarsal bone.\nTo test the FHL, the distal phalanx of the great toe is flexed against\nresistance; if normal, the tendon can be seen and palpated on the plantar aspect\nof the great toe as it crosses the joints of the toe.\nFlexor Digitorum Longus. The flexor digitorum longus (FDL) is smaller\nthan the FHL, even though it moves four digits (Figs. 7.62G\u2013K, 7.63B, and\n7.65A, B; Table 7.13.II). It passes diagonally into the sole of the foot, superficial\nto the tendon of the FHL. However, its direction of pull is realigned by the\nquadratus plantae muscle, which is attached to the posterolateral aspect of the\nFDL tendon as it divides into four tendons (Figs. 7.62H and 7.65B), which in\nturn pass to the distal phalanges of the lateral four digits.\nTo test the FDL, the distal phalanges of the lateral four toes are flexed\nagainst resistance; if they are acting normally, the tendons of the toes can be seen\nand palpated.\nTibialis Posterior.

Distally, the TP attaches primarily to the\nnavicular bone (in close proximity to the high point of the medial longitudinal\narch of the foot) but has attachments to other tarsal and metatarsal bones.\nThe TP is traditionally described as an invertor of the foot. Indeed, when the\nfoot is off the ground, it can act synergistically with the TA to invert the foot,\ntheir otherwise antagonistic functions canceling each other out. However, the\nprimary role of the TP is to support or maintain (fix) the medial longitudinal arch\nduring weight bearing; consequently, the muscle contracts statically throughout\nthe stance phase of gait (see Fig. 7.21A\u2013E; Table 7.2). In so doing, it acts\nindependently of the TA because once the foot is flat on the ground after heel\nstrike, that muscle is relaxed during the stance phase (the dorsiflexion that occurs\nas the body passes over the planted foot is passive), unless braking requires its\neccentric contraction.\nWhile standing (especially on one foot), however, the two muscles may\ncooperate to depress the lateral side of the foot and pull medially on the leg as\nneeded to counteract lateral leaning for balance.\nTo test the TA, the foot is inverted against resistance with the foot in slight\nplantarflexion; if normal, the tendon can be seen and palpated posterior to the\nmedial malleolus.\nNERVES IN POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT\nThe tibial nerve (L4, L5, and S1\u2013S3) is the larger of the two terminal branches\nof the sciatic nerve (Fig. 7.58B; Table 7.11). It runs vertically through the\npopliteal fossa with the popliteal artery, passing between the heads of the\ngastrocnemius, the two structures exiting the fossa by passing deep to the\ntendinous arch of the soleus (Fig. 7.63B).\nThe tibial nerve supplies all muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg\n(Figs. 7.54A and 7.63B; Table 7.11). At the ankle, the nerve lies between the\ntendons of the FHL and the FDL. Postero-inferior to the medial malleolus, the\ntibial nerve divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves. A branch of the\ntibial nerve, the medial sural cutaneous nerve, is usually joined by the sural\ncommunicating branch of the common fibular nerve to form the sural nerve (see\nFigs. 7.50B and 7.51; Table 7.11).

It begins at\nthe distal border of the popliteus, as the popliteal artery passes deep to the\ntendinous arch of the soleus and simultaneously bifurcates into its terminal\nbranches. Close to its origin, the posterior tibial artery gives rise to its largest\nbranch, the fibular artery, which runs lateral and parallel to it, also within the\ndeep subcompartment.\nDuring its descent, the posterior tibial artery is accompanied by the tibial\nnerve and veins. The artery runs posterior to the medial malleolus, from which it\nis separated by the tendons of the TP and FDL (Fig. 7.63B). Inferior to the\nmedial malleolus, it runs between the tendons of the FHL and FDL. Deep to the\nflexor retinaculum and the origin of the abductor hallucis, the posterior tibial\nartery divides into medial and lateral plantar arteries, the arteries of the sole of\nthe foot.\nThe fibular (peroneal) artery, the largest and most important branch of the\nposterior tibial artery, arises inferior to the distal border of the popliteus and the\ntendinous arch of the soleus (Figs. 7.59A, 7.63B, and 7.66; Table 7.12). It\ndescends obliquely toward the fibula and passes along its medial side, usually\nwithin the FHL. The fibular artery gives muscular branches to the popliteus and\nother muscles in both the posterior and the lateral compartments of the leg. It\nalso gives rise to the nutrient artery of the fibula (Fig. 7.66).\nDistally, the fibular artery gives rise to a perforating branch and terminal\nlateral malleolar and calcaneal branches. The perforating branch pierces the\ninterosseous membrane and passes to the dorsum of the foot, where it\nanastomoses with the arcuate artery. The lateral calcaneal branches supply the\nheel, and the lateral malleolar branch joins other malleolar branches to form a\nperi-articular arterial anastomosis of the ankle.\nThe circumflex fibular artery arises from the origin of the anterior or\nposterior tibial artery at the knee and passes laterally over the neck of the fibula\nto the anastomoses around the knee.\n1732"

Palpation of this pulse is commonly performed with the person in the\nprone position with the knee flexed to relax the popliteal fascia and hamstrings.\nThe pulsations are best felt in the inferior part of the fossa where the popliteal\nartery is related to the tibia. Weakening or loss of the popliteal pulse is a sign of\na femoral artery obstruction.\n Popliteal Aneurysm and Hemorrhage\nA popliteal aneurysm (abnormal dilation of all or part of the popliteal artery)\nusually causes edema and pain in the popliteal fossa. A popliteal aneurysm may\nbe distinguished from other masses by palpable pulsations (thrills) and\nabnormal arterial sounds (bruits) detectable with a stethoscope. Because the\nartery lies deep to the tibial nerve, an aneurysm may stretch the nerve or\ncompress its blood supply (vasa vasorum). Pain from such nerve compression is\nusually referred, in this case to the skin overlying the medial aspect of the calf,\nankle, or foot.\nBecause the popliteal artery is closely applied to the popliteal surface of the\nfemur and the joint capsule (see Fig. 7.60), fractures of the distal femur or\ndislocations of the knee may rupture the artery, resulting in hemorrhage.\nFurthermore, because of their proximity and confinement within the popliteal\nfossa, an injury of the artery and vein may result in an arteriovenous fistula\n(communication between an artery and a vein). Failure to recognize these\noccurrences and to act promptly may result in the loss of the leg and foot.\nIf the femoral artery must be ligated, blood can bypass the occlusion\nthrough the genicular anastomosis and reach the popliteal artery distal to the\nligation (see Fig. 7.53).\n Injury to Tibial Nerve\nInjury to the tibial nerve is uncommon because of its deep and protected\nposition in the popliteal fossa; however, the nerve may be injured by deep\nlacerations in the fossa.

Because the septa and deep fascia\nof the leg forming the boundaries of the leg compartments are strong, the\nincreased volume consequent to infection with suppuration (formation of pus)\nincreases intracompartmental pressure.

The swollen muscles are painful and tender to pressure.\n Fibularis Muscles and Evolution of\nHuman Foot\nWhereas the feet of anthropoids (higher primates) are inverted so that they walk\non the outer border of the foot, the feet of humans are relatively everted\n(pronated) so that the soles lie more fully on the ground. This pronation is the\nresult, at least in part, of the medial migration of the distal attachment of the\nfibularis longus across the sole of the foot (Fig. 7.62K) and the development of\na fibularis tertius that is attached to the base of the 5th metatarsal. These\nfeatures are unique to the human foot.\n Injury to Common Fibular Nerve and\nFootdrop\nBecause of its superficial position, the common fibular nerve is the nerve most\noften injured in the lower limb, mainly because it winds subcutaneously around\nthe fibular neck, leaving it vulnerable to direct trauma (see Fig. 7.58A). This\nnerve may also be severed during fracture of the fibular neck or severely\nstretched when the knee joint is injured or dislocated. Severance of the common\nfibular nerve results in flaccid paralysis of all muscles in the anterior and lateral\ncompartments of the leg (dorsiflexors of ankle and evertors of foot). The loss of\ndorsiflexion of the ankle causes footdrop, which is further exacerbated by\nunopposed inversion of the foot. This has the effect of making the limb \u201ctoo\nlong\u201d: the toes do not clear the ground during the swing phase of walking (Fig.\nB7.21A, E).\nThere are several other conditions that may result in a lower limb that is\n\u201ctoo long\u201d functionally, for example, pelvic tilt (see Fig. B7.19C) and spastic\nparalysis or contraction of the soleus.

A neglected puncture wound may lead to an\nextensive deep infection, resulting in swelling, pain, and fever.\nDeep infections of the foot often localize within the compartments between\nthe muscular layers (see Fig. 7.72B). A well-established infection in one of the\nenclosed fascial or muscular spaces usually requires surgical incision and\ndrainage. When possible, the incision is made on the medial side of the foot,\npassing superior to the abductor hallucis to allow visualization of critical\nneurovascular structures, while avoiding production of a painful scar in a\nweight-bearing area.\n Contusion of Extensor Digitorum Brevis\nFunctionally, the EDB and EHB muscles are relatively unimportant. Clinically,\nknowing the location of the belly of the EDB is important for distinguishing it\nfrom abnormal edema. Contusion and tearing of muscle fibers and associated\nblood vessels result in a hematoma (clotted extravasated blood), producing\nedema anteromedial to the lateral malleolus. Most people who have not seen\nthis inflamed muscle assume they have a severely sprained ankle.\n Sural Nerve Grafts\nPieces of the sural nerve are often used for nerve grafts in procedures such as\nrepairing nerve defects resulting from wounds. The surgeon is usually able to\nlocate this nerve in relation to the small saphenous vein (see Fig. 7.76B).\nBecause of the variations in the level of formation of the sural nerve, the\nsurgeon may have to make incisions in both legs and then select the better\nspecimen.\n1777"

Numbers\nin parentheses in A refer to structures identified in B. C. The\norientation drawing shows the level of the section.\nThe lip-shaped acetabular labrum (L. labrum, lip) is a fibrocartilaginous\nrim attached to the margin of the acetabulum, increasing the acetabular articular\narea by nearly 10%. The transverse acetabular ligament, a continuation of the\nacetabular labrum, bridges the acetabular notch (Figs. 7.80 and 7.81C). As a\nresult of the height of the rim and labrum, more than half of the femoral head fits\nwithin the acetabulum (Figs. 7.81C and 7.82). Thus, during dissection, the\nfemoral head must be cut from the acetabular rim to enable disarticulation of the\njoint. Centrally, a deep nonarticular part, called the acetabular fossa, is formed\nmainly by the ischium (Figs. 7.80, 7.81C, and 7.82). This fossa is thin walled\n(often translucent) and continuous inferiorly with the acetabular notch.\nThe articular surfaces of the acetabulum and femoral head are most\ncongruent when the hip is flexed 90\u00b0, abducted 5\u00b0, and rotated laterally 10\u00b0 (the\nposition in which the axis of the acetabulum and the axis of the femoral head and\nneck are aligned), which is the quadruped position!\nIn other words, in assuming the upright position, a relatively small degree of\njoint stability was sacrificed to maximize weight bearing when erect. Even so,\nthe hip joint is our most stable joint, owing also to its complete ball and socket\nconstruction (depth of socket), the strength of its joint capsule, and the\nattachments of muscles crossing the joint, many of which are located at some\ndistance from the center of movement (Palastanga et al., 2011).\nJOINT CAPSULE OF HIP JOINT\nThe hip joints are enclosed within strong joint capsules, formed of a loose\nexternal fibrous layer (fibrous capsule) and an internal synovial membrane (Fig.\n7.81C). Proximally, the fibrous layer attaches to the acetabulum, just peripheral\nto the acetabular rim to which the labrum is attached, and to the transverse\nacetabular ligament (Figs. 7.81C and 7.83A, C, and D). Distally, the fibrous\nlayer attaches to the femoral neck only anteriorly at the intertrochanteric line\nand root of the greater trochanter (Fig. 7.83B). Posteriorly, the fibrous layer\ncrosses the femoral neck proximal to the intertrochanteric crest but is not\nattached to it.\n1788"

Extension\nwinds the spiraling ligaments and fibers more tightly, constricting the capsule\nand drawing the femoral head tightly into the acetabulum (Fig. 7.81B). The\ntightened fibrous layer increases the stability of the joint but restricts extension\nof the joint to 10\u201320\u00b0 beyond the vertical position. Flexion increasingly unwinds\nthe spiraling ligaments and fibers. This permits considerable flexion of the hip\njoint with increasing mobility.\nOf the three intrinsic ligaments of the joint capsule below, it is the first one\nthat reinforces and strengthens the joint:\nAnteriorly and superiorly is the strong, Y-shaped iliofemoral ligament,\nwhich attaches to the anterior inferior iliac spine and the acetabular rim\nproximally and the intertrochanteric line distally (Fig. 7.83A, C).

It is further\nreinforced by overlying tendons of the rectus femoris and iliopsoas muscles\n(Fig. 7.83B, C).\nAnteriorly and inferiorly is the pubofemoral ligament, which arises from\nthe obturator crest of the pubic bone and passes laterally and inferiorly to\nmerge with the fibrous layer of the joint capsule (Fig. 7.83A). This ligament\nblends with the medial part of the iliofemoral ligament and tightens during\nboth extension and abduction of the hip joint.

The ligaments and peri-articular muscles (the\nmedial and lateral rotators of the thigh) play a vital role in maintaining the\nstructural integrity of the joint.\nBoth muscles and ligaments pull the femoral head medially into the\nacetabulum, and they are reciprocally balanced when doing so. The medial\nflexors, located anteriorly, are fewer, weaker, and less mechanically advantaged,\nwhereas the anterior ligaments are strongest. Conversely, the ligaments are\nweaker posteriorly where the medial rotators are abundant, stronger, and more\nmechanically advantaged.\nIn all synovial joints, a synovial membrane lines the internal surfaces of the\nfibrous layer, as well as any intracapsular bony surfaces not lined with articular\ncartilage. Thus, in the hip joint, where the fibrous layer attaches to the femur\ndistant from the articular cartilage covering the femoral head, the synovial\nmembrane of the hip joint reflects proximally along the femoral neck to the\nedge of the femoral head. Longitudinal synovial folds (retinacula) occur in the\nsynovial membrane covering the femoral neck (Fig. 7.81C).

The relative positions of the functional\nmuscle groups producing movements of the hip joint and the\ndirection of the movement are demonstrated.\nThe degree of flexion and extension possible at the hip joint depends on the\nposition of the knee. If the knee is flexed, relaxing the hamstrings, the hip joint\ncan be actively flexed until the thigh almost reaches the anterior abdominal wall\nand can reach it via further passive flexion. Not all of this movement occurs at\nthe hip joint; some results from flexion of the vertebral column. During\nextension of the hip joint, the fibrous layer of the joint capsule, especially the\niliofemoral ligament, is taut; therefore, the hip can usually be extended only\nslightly beyond the vertical except by movement of the bony pelvis (flexion of\nlumbar vertebrae).\nFrom the anatomical position, the range of abduction of the hip joint is\nusually somewhat greater than for adduction. About 60\u00b0 of abduction is possible\nwhen the thigh is extended at the hip joint and more when it is flexed. Lateral\nrotation is much more powerful than medial rotation.\nThe main muscles producing movements of the hip joint are listed in Figure\n7.85B. Note the following:\n1. The iliopsoas is the strongest flexor of the hip.\n2. In addition to its function as an adductor, the adductor magnus also serves as\na flexor (anterior or aponeurotic part) and an extensor (posterior or\nhamstrings part).\n3. Several muscles participate in both flexion and adduction (pectineus and\ngracilis as well all three \u201cadductor\u201d muscles).\n4. In addition to serving as abductors, the anterior portions of the gluteus medius\nand minimus are also medial rotators.\n5. The gluteus maximus serves as the primary extensor from the flexed to the\nstraight (standing) position, and from this point posteriorly, extension is\nachieved primarily by the hamstrings.

They are sometimes called external ligaments to differentiate them from\ninternal ligaments, such as the cruciate ligaments.\nThe patellar ligament, the distal part of the quadriceps femoris tendon, is a\nstrong, thick fibrous band passing from the apex and adjoining margins of the\npatella to the tibial tuberosity (Fig. 7.86A). The patellar ligament is the anterior\nligament of the knee joint. Laterally, it receives the medial and lateral patellar\nretinacula, aponeurotic expansions of the vastus medialis and lateralis and\noverlying deep fascia. The retinacula make up the joint capsule of the knee on\neach side of the patella (Figs. 7.88A and 7.89B) and play an important role in\nmaintaining alignment of the patella relative to the patellar articular surface of\nthe femur. The oblique placement of the femur and/or line of pull of the\nquadriceps femoris muscle relative to the axis of the patellar tendon and tibia,\nassessed clinically as the Q-angle, favors lateral displacement of the patella (Fig.\n7.86).\nThe collateral ligaments of the knee are taut when the knee is fully extended,\ncontributing to stability while standing (Fig. 7.90A, D). As flexion proceeds,\nthey become increasingly slack, permitting and limiting (serving as check\nligaments for) rotation at the knee.\n1803"

The tendon of the biceps femoris is split into two parts by the FCL\n(Fig. 7.90A).\nThe tibial collateral ligament (TCL; medial collateral ligament) is a strong,\nflat, intrinsic (capsular) band that extends from the medial epicondyle of the\nfemur to the medial condyle and the superior part of the medial surface of the\ntibia (Fig. 7.90D, E). At its midpoint, the deep fibers of the TCL are firmly\nattached to the medial meniscus. The TCL, weaker than the FCL, is more often\ndamaged.

Kucharczyk, Professor and Neuroradiologist Senior\nScientist, Department of Medical Resonance Imaging,\nUniversity Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.)\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the weaker of the two cruciate\nligaments, arises from the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia, just posterior to\nthe attachment of the medial meniscus (Fig. 7.91A, B). The ACL has a relatively\npoor blood supply. It extends superiorly, posteriorly, and laterally to attach to the\nposterior part of the medial side of the lateral condyle of the femur (Fig. 7.91C).\nIt limits posterior rolling (turning and traveling) of the femoral condyles on the\ntibial plateau during flexion, converting it to spin (turning in place). It also\nprevents posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia and hyperextension of\nthe knee joint. When the joint is flexed at a right angle, the tibia cannot be pulled\nanteriorly (like pulling out a drawer) because it is held by the ACL.\nThe posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the stronger of the two cruciate\nligaments, arises from the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia (Fig. 7.91A,\nD). The PCL passes superiorly and anteriorly on the medial side of the ACL to\nattach to the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial condyle of the\nfemur (Fig. 7.91B, C). The PCL limits anterior rolling of the femur on the tibial\nplateau during extension, converting it to spin. It also prevents anterior\ndisplacement of the femur on the tibia or posterior displacement of the tibia on\nthe femur and helps prevent hyperflexion of the knee joint. In the weight-bearing\nflexed knee, the PCL is the main stabilizing factor for the femur (e.g., when\nwalking downhill).\nThe menisci of the knee joint are crescentic plates (\u201cwafers\u201d) of\nfibrocartilage on the articular surface of the tibia that deepen the surface and play\na role in shock absorption (Figs. 7.89 and 7.90). The menisci (G. meniskos,\ncrescent) are thicker at their external margins and taper to thin, unattached edges\nin the interior of the joint. Wedge shaped in transverse section, the menisci are\nfirmly attached at their ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia (Fig. 7.89A).\nTheir external margins attach to the joint capsule of the knee. The coronary\nligaments are portions of the joint capsule extending between the margins of the\nmenisci and most of the periphery of the tibial condyles (Figs. 7.91B and 7.92A).\nA slender fibrous band, the transverse ligament of the knee, joins the anterior\nedges of the menisci, crossing the anterior intercondylar area (Fig. 7.9A) and\ntethering the menisci to each other during knee movements.\n1811"

Its\nposterior end is attached to the posterior intercondylar area, anterior to the\nattachment of the PCL. The medial meniscus firmly adheres to the deep surface\nof the TCL (Figs. 7.90D and 7.92A\u2013D). Because of its widespread attachments\nlaterally to the tibial intercondylar area and medially to the TCL, the medial\nmeniscus is less mobile on the tibial plateau than is the lateral meniscus.\nThe lateral meniscus is nearly circular, smaller, and more freely movable\nthan the medial meniscus (Fig. 7.90A). The tendon of the popliteus has two parts\nproximally. One part attaches to the lateral epicondyle of the femur and passes\nbetween the lateral meniscus and inferior part of the lateral epicondylar surface\nof the femur (on the tendon\u2019s medial aspect) and the FCL that overlies its lateral\naspect (Figs. 7.90A and 7.91B, D).

In addition, an interosseous\nmembrane joins the shafts of the tibia and fibula (Fig. 7.95A). The fibers of the\ninterosseous membrane and all ligaments of both tibiofibular articulations run\ninferiorly from the tibia to the fibula. Thus, the membrane and ligaments\nstrongly resist the downward pull placed on the fibula by eight of the nine\nmuscles attached to it (Fig. 7.95C). However, they allow slight upward\nmovement of the fibula that occurs when the wide (posterior) end of the trochlea\nof the talus is wedged between the malleoli during dorsiflexion at the ankle.\nMovement at the superior tibiofibular joint is impossible without movement at\nthe inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis.\nThe anterior tibial vessels pass through a hiatus at the superior end of the\ninterosseous membrane (Fig. 7.95A, B). At the inferior end of the membrane is a\nsmaller hiatus through which the perforating branch of the fibular artery passes.\nTIBIOFIBULAR JOINT\nThe tibiofibular joint (superior tibiofibular joint) is a plane type of synovial\njoint between the flat facet on the fibular head and a similar articular facet\nlocated posterolaterally on the lateral tibial condyle (Figs. 7.92B, D and 7.95A).\nA tense joint capsule surrounds the joint and attaches to the margins of the\narticular surfaces of the fibula and tibia. The joint capsule is strengthened by\nanterior and posterior ligaments of the fibular head, which pass superomedially\nfrom the fibular head to the lateral tibial condyle (Fig. 7.92B). The joint is\ncrossed posteriorly by the tendon of the popliteus. A pouch of synovial\nmembrane from the knee joint, the popliteus bursa (Fig. 7.96; Table 7.17),\npasses between the tendon of the popliteus and the lateral condyle of the tibia.\nAbout 20% of the time, the bursa also communicates with the synovial cavity of\nthe tibiofibular joint, enabling transmigration of inflammatory processes between\nthe two joints.\nMovement. Slight movement of the joint occurs during dorsiflexion of the\nfoot as a result of wedging of the trochlea of the talus between the malleoli (see\n\u201cArticular Surfaces of Ankle Joint\u201d later in this chapter).\nBlood Supply.

It is the fibrous union\nof the tibia and fibula by means of the interosseous membrane (uniting the\nshafts) and the anterior, interosseous, and posterior tibiofibular ligaments (the\nlatter making up the inferior tibiofibular joint, uniting the distal ends of the\nbones). The integrity of the inferior tibiofibular joint is essential for the stability\nof the ankle joint because it keeps the lateral malleolus firmly against the lateral\nsurface of the talus.\nArticular Surfaces and Ligaments. The rough, triangular articular area on\nthe medial surface of the inferior end of the fibula articulates with a facet on the\ninferior end of the tibia (Fig. 7.94A).

Posterior talofibular ligament, a thick, fairly strong band that runs\nhorizontally medially and slightly posteriorly from the malleolar fossa to the\nlateral tubercle of the talus.\n3. Calcaneofibular ligament, a round cord that passes postero-inferiorly from\nthe tip of the lateral malleolus to the lateral surface of the calcaneus.\nThe joint capsule is reinforced medially by the large, strong medial\nligament of the ankle (deltoid ligament) that attaches proximally to the medial\nmalleolus (Fig. 7.100). The medial ligament fans out from the malleolus,\nattaching distally to the talus, calcaneus, and navicular via four adjacent and\ncontinuous parts: the tibionavicular part, the tibiocalcaneal part, and the\nanterior and posterior tibiotalar parts. The medial ligament stabilizes the\nankle joint during eversion and prevents subluxation (partial dislocation) of the\njoint.\nMOVEMENTS OF ANKLE JOINT\nThe main movements of the ankle joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the\nfoot, which occur around a transverse axis passing through the talus (Fig.\n7.100B). Because the narrow end of the trochlea of the talus lies loosely between\nthe malleoli when the foot is plantarflexed, some \u201cwobble\u201d (small amounts of\nabduction, adduction, inversion, and eversion) is possible in this unstable\nposition.\nDorsiflexion of the ankle is produced by the muscles in the anterior\ncompartment of the leg (see Table 7.10). Dorsiflexion is usually limited by\nthe passive resistance of the triceps surae to stretching and by tension in the\nmedial and lateral ligaments.\nPlantarflexion of the ankle is produced by the muscles in the posterior\ncompartment of the leg (see Table 7.13).

The important intertarsal joints are the subtalar\n(talocalcaneal) joint and the transverse tarsal joint (calcaneocuboid and\ntalonavicular joints).

The other intertarsal joints (e.g., intercuneiform joints)\nand the tarsometatarsal and intermetatarsal joints are relatively small and are so\ntightly joined by ligaments that only slight movement occurs between them. In\nthe foot, flexion and extension occur in the forefoot at the metatarsophalangeal\nand interphalangeal joints (Fig. 7.102A, B; Table 7.19).

Such conditions,\nmost common in children 3\u20139 years of age, produce hip pain that may radiate to\nthe knee.\n Dislocation of Hip Joint\nCongenital dislocation of the hip joint is common, occurring in approximately\n1.5 per 1,000 neonates; it is bilateral in approximately half the cases.

Dislocation\noccurs when the femoral head is not properly located in the acetabulum.\nInability to abduct the thigh is characteristic of congenital dislocation.

Excess pressure is placed on the\nmedial aspect of the knee joint, which results in arthrosis (destruction of knee\ncartilages), and the fibular collateral ligament is overstressed (Fig. B7.33D). A\nlateral angulation of the leg (large Q-angle, >17\u00b0) in relation to the thigh\n(exaggeration of the knee angle) is called genu valgum (knock-knee) (Fig.\nB7.33C). Because of the exaggerated knee angle in genu valgum, the weight-\nbearing line falls lateral to the center of the knee. Consequently, the tibial\ncollateral ligament is overstretched, and there is excess stress on the lateral\nmeniscus and cartilages of the lateral femoral and tibial condyles. The patella,\nnormally pulled laterally by the tendon of the vastus lateralis, is pulled even\nfarther laterally when the leg is extended in the presence of genu valgum so that\nits articulation with the femur is abnormal.\nChildren commonly appear bowlegged for 1\u20132 years after starting to walk,\nand knock-knees are frequently observed in children 2\u20134 years of age.\nPersistence of these abnormal knee angles in late childhood usually means\ncongenital deformities exist that may require correction.

Patellar\ndislocation is more common in women, presumably because of their greater Q-\nangle, which, in addition to representing the oblique placement of the femur\nrelative to the tibia, represents the angle of pull of the quadriceps relative to the\naxis of the patella and tibia (the term Q-angle was actually coined in reference\nto the angle of pull of the quadriceps). The tendency toward lateral dislocation\nis normally counterbalanced by the medial, more horizontal pull of the powerful\nvastus medialis.

In addition to being the route for aspiration of serous and sanguineous\n(bloody) fluid, this triangular area also lends itself to drug injection for treating\npathology of the knee joint.\n Bursitis in Knee Region\nPrepatellar bursitis is caused by excessive and repeated friction between the\nskin and the patella, for example, jobs associated with kneeling. However, the\nbursa may also be injured by compressive forces resulting from a direct blow or\nfrom falling on the flexed knee (Fig. B7.37). If the inflammation is chronic, the\nbursa becomes distended with fluid and forms a swelling anterior to the knee.\n1855"

As children get older, the fat is lost,\nand a normal medial longitudinal arch becomes visible (Fig. B7.43C). Flat feet\ncan either be flexible (flat, lacking a medial arch, when weight bearing but\nnormal in appearance when not bearing weight [Fig. B7.43D]) or rigid (flat\neven when not bearing weight). The more common flexible flat feet result from\nloose or degenerated intrinsic ligaments (inadequate passive arch support).\nFlexible flat feet is common in childhood but usually resolves with age as the\nligaments grow and mature. The condition occasionally persists into adulthood\nand may or may not be symptomatic.\nRigid flat feet with a history that goes back to childhood are likely to result\nfrom a bone deformity (such as a fusion of adjacent tarsal bones). Acquired flat\nfeet (\u201cfallen arches\u201d) are likely to be secondary to dysfunction of the tibialis\nposterior (dynamic arch support) owing to trauma, degeneration with age, or\ndenervation. In the absence of normal passive or dynamic support, the plantar\ncalcaneonavicular ligament fails to support the head of the talus. Consequently,\nthe head of the talus displaces inferomedially and becomes prominent (Fig.\nB7.43D, red arrows). As a result, some flattening of the medial part of the\nlongitudinal arch occurs, along with lateral deviation of the forefoot.

The bones forming the calvaria are primarily\nflat bones (frontal, parietal, and occipital; see Fig. 8.8A) formed by\nintramembranous ossification of head mesenchyme from the neural crest. The\nbones contributing to the cranial base are primarily irregular bones with\nsubstantial flat portions (sphenoidal and temporal) formed by endochondral\nossification of cartilage (chondrocranium) or from more than one type of\nossification. The ethmoid bone is an irregular bone that makes a relatively minor\nmidline contribution to the neurocranium but is primarily part of the\nviscerocranium (see Fig. 8.7A). The so-called flat bones and flat portions of the\nbones forming the neurocranium are actually curved, with convex external and\nconcave internal surfaces.\nMost calvarial bones are united by fibrous interlocking sutures (Fig. 8.1A,\nB; also see Chapter 1, Overview and Basic Concepts); however, during\nchildhood, some bones (sphenoid and occipital) are united by hyaline cartilage\n(synchondroses\u2014cartilaginous joints). The spinal cord is continuous with the\nbrain through the foramen magnum, a large opening in the cranial base (Fig.\n8.1C).\nThe viscerocranium (facial skeleton) comprises the facial bones that mainly\ndevelop in the mesenchyme of the embryonic pharyngeal arches (Moore et al.,\n2016). The viscerocranium forms the anterior part of the cranium, and it consists\nof the bones surrounding the mouth (upper and lower jaws), nose/nasal cavity,\nand most of the orbits (eye sockets or orbital cavities) (Figs. 8.2 and 8.3).\nThe viscerocranium consists of 15 irregular bones: 3 singular bones centered\non or lying in the midline (mandible, ethmoid, and vomer), and 6 bones\noccurring as bilateral pairs (maxillae; inferior nasal conchae; and zygomatic,\npalatine, nasal, and lacrimal bones) (Figs. 8.1A and 8.4A). The maxillae and\nmandible house the teeth, that is, they provide the sockets and supporting bone\nfor the maxillary and mandibular teeth. The maxillae contribute the greatest part\nof the upper facial skeleton, forming the skeleton of the upper jaw, which is\nfixed to the cranial base. The mandible forms the skeleton of the lower jaw,\nwhich is movable because it articulates with the cranial base at the\ntemporomandibular joints (Figs. 8.1A and 8.2).\n1876"

This standard craniometric reference is the orbitomeatal plane\n(Frankfort horizontal plane).\nFacial Aspect of Cranium\nFeatures of the anterior or facial (frontal) aspect of the cranium are the frontal\nand zygomatic bones, orbits, nasal region, maxillae, and mandible (Figs. 8.2 and\n8.3).\nThe frontal bone, specifically its squamous (flat) part, forms the skeleton\nof the forehead, articulating inferiorly with the nasal and zygomatic bones. In\nsome adults, a frontal suture persists; this remnant is called a metopic suture. It\nis in the middle glabella, the smooth, slightly depressed area between the\nsuperciliary arches. The frontal suture divides the frontal bones of the fetal\ncranium (see the clinical box \u201cDevelopment of Cranium\u201d).\nThe intersection of the frontal and nasal bones is the nasion (L. nasus, nose),\nwhich in most people is related to a distinctly depressed area (bridge of the nose)\n(Figs. 8.1A and 8.2A). The nasion is one of many craniometric points that are\nused radiographically in medicine (or on dry crania in physical anthropology) to\nmake cranial measurements, compare and describe the topography of the\ncranium, and document abnormal variations (Fig. 8.6; Table 8.1). The frontal\nbone also articulates with the lacrimal, ethmoid, and sphenoids; a horizontal\nportion of bone (orbital part) forms both the roof of the orbit and part of the\nfloor of the anterior part of the cranial cavity (Fig. 8.3).\n1880"

A small zygomaticofacial\nforamen pierces the lateral aspect of each bone (Figs. 8.3 and 8.4A). The\nzygomatic bones articulate with the frontal, sphenoid, and temporal bones and\nthe maxillae.\nInferior to the nasal bones is the pear-shaped piriform aperture, the anterior\nnasal opening in the cranium (Figs. 8.1A and 8.2A). The bony nasal septum can\nbe observed through this aperture, dividing the nasal cavity into right and left\nparts. On the lateral wall of each nasal cavity are curved bony plates, the nasal\nconchae (Figs. 8.2A and 8.3).\nThe maxillae form the upper jaw. Their alveolar processes include the tooth\nsockets (alveoli) and constitute the supporting bone for the maxillary teeth. The\ntwo maxillae are united at the intermaxillary suture in the median plane (Fig.\n8.2A). The maxillae surround most of the piriform aperture and form the infra-\norbital margins medially. They have a broad connection with the zygomatic\nbones laterally and an infra-orbital foramen inferior to each orbit for passage of\nthe infra-orbital nerve and vessels (Fig. 8.3).\nThe mandible is a U-shaped bone with an alveolar part that supports the\nmandibular teeth.

The internal\ncarotid artery and its accompanying sympathetic and venous plexuses pass\nacross the superior aspect of the cartilage (i.e., pass over the foramen), and some\nnerves traverse it horizontally, passing to a foramen in its anterior boundary.\nExtending posteriorly and laterally from the foramen lacerum is a narrow\ngroove for the greater petrosal nerve on the anterosuperior surface of the\npetrous part of the temporal bone.

The hypoglossal canal for the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is\nsuperior to the anterolateral margin of the foramen magnum.\nWalls of Cranial Cavity\nThe walls of the cranial cavity vary in thickness in different regions. They are\nusually thinner in females than in males and are thinner in children and elderly\npeople. The bones tend to be thinnest in areas that are well covered with\nmuscles, such as the squamous part of the temporal bone (Fig. 8.11). Thin areas\nof bone can be seen radiographically (Fig. 8.5) or by holding a dried cranium up\nto a bright light.\nMost bones of the calvaria consist of internal and external tables of\ncompact bone, separated by diplo\u00eb (Figs. 8.5 and 8.11). The diplo\u00eb is\ncancellous bone containing red bone marrow during life, through which run\ncanals formed by diploic veins. The diplo\u00eb in a dried calvaria is not red because\nthe protein was removed during preparation of the cranium. The internal table of\nbone is thinner than the external table, and in some areas, there is only a thin\nplate of compact bone with no diplo\u00eb.\nThe bony substance of the cranium is unequally distributed. Relatively thin\n(but mostly curved) flat bones provide the necessary strength to maintain cavities\nand protect their contents. However, in addition to housing the brain, the bones\nof the neurocranium (and processes from them) provide proximal attachment for\nthe strong muscles of mastication that attach distally to the mandible.\nConsequently, high traction forces occur across the nasal cavity and orbits that\nare sandwiched between. Therefore, thickened portions of the cranial bones form\nstronger pillars or buttresses that transmit forces, bypassing the orbits and nasal\ncavity (Fig. 8.13). The main buttresses are the frontonasal buttress, extending\nfrom the region of the canine teeth between the nasal and the orbital cavities to\nthe central frontal bone, and the zygomatic arch\u2013lateral orbital margin\nbuttress from the region of the molars to the lateral frontal and temporal bones.\nSimilarly, occipital buttresses transmit forces received lateral to the foramen\nmagnum from the vertebral column. Perhaps to compensate for the denser bone\nrequired for these buttresses, some areas of the cranium not as mechanically\nstressed become pneumatized (air filled).\n1898"

The complications of\nhead injuries include hemorrhage, infection, and injury to the brain (e.g.,\nconcussion) and cranial nerves. Disturbance in the level of consciousness is the\nmost common symptom of head injury. Almost 10% of all deaths in the United\nStates are caused by injury, and approximately half of traumatic deaths involve\nthe brain (Louis et al., 2016). Head injuries occur mostly in young persons\nbetween the ages of 15 and 24 years. The major cause of brain injury varies;\nhowever, motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents are prominent.\n Headaches and Facial Pain\nFew complaints are more common than headaches and facial pain. Although\nusually benign and frequently associated with tension, fatigue, or mild fever,\nheadaches may indicate a serious intracranial problem such as a brain tumor,\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, or meningitis. Neuralgias (G. algos, pain) are\ncharacterized by severe throbbing or stabbing pain along the course of a nerve\ncaused by a demyelinating lesion. They are a common cause of facial pain.\nTerms such as facial neuralgia describe diffuse painful sensations. Localized\naches have specific names, such as earache (otalgia) and toothache\n(odontalgia). A sound knowledge of the clinical anatomy of the head helps in\nunderstanding the causes of headaches and facial pain.\n Injury to Superciliary Arches\nThe superciliary arches are relatively sharp bony ridges (see Fig. 8.3).\nConsequently, a blow to them (e.g., during boxing) may lacerate the skin and\ncause bleeding. Bruising of the skin surrounding the orbit causes tissue fluid\nand blood to accumulate in the surrounding connective tissue, which gravitates\ninto the superior (upper) eyelid and around the eye (\u201cblack eye\u201d; see Fig.\n1901"

However, a fracture may occur some distance from the site of direct\ntrauma where the calvaria is thinner.

The smallness of the face results from the rudimentary\ndevelopment of the maxillae, mandible, and paranasal sinuses (air-filled bone\ncavities), the absence of erupted teeth, and the small size of the nasal cavities.\nThe halves of the frontal bone in the neonate are separated by the frontal\nsuture, the frontal and parietal bones are separated by the coronal suture, and\nthe maxillae and mandibles are separated by the intermaxillary suture and\nmandibular symphysis (secondary cartilaginous joint), respectively. There are\nno mastoid and styloid processes (Fig. B8.6A, B). Because there are no mastoid\nprocesses at birth, the facial nerves are close to the surface when they emerge\nfrom the stylomastoid foramina. Thus, the facial nerves may be injured by\nforceps during a difficult delivery or later by an incision posterior to the auricle\nof the external ear (e.g., for the surgical treatment of mastoiditis or middle ear\nproblems). The mastoid processes form gradually during the 1st year as the\nsternocleidomastoid muscles complete their development and pull on the\npetromastoid parts of the temporal bones.\nThe bones of the calvaria of neonates are separated by fontanelles (fibrous\nmembranes; palpable deep to the scalp, these are perceived as \u201csoft spots\u201d). The\nlargest occur between the angles (corners) of the flat bones (Fig. B8.6A, B).\nThey include the anterior and posterior fontanelles and the paired sphenoidal\nand mastoid fontanelles. Palpation of the fontanelles during infancy, especially\nthe anterior and posterior ones, enables physicians to determine the following:\nProgress of growth of the frontal and parietal bones.\nDegree of hydration of an infant (a depressed fontanelle indicates\ndehydration).\nLevel of intracranial pressure (a bulging fontanelle indicates increased\npressure on the brain).\nThe anterior fontanelle, the largest one, is diamond or star shaped. It is\nbounded by the halves of the frontal bone anteriorly and the parietal bones\nposteriorly (Fig. B8.6). Therefore, it is located at the junction of the sagittal,\ncoronal, and frontal sutures, the future site of bregma (Fig. 8.6; Table 8.1).

            "Text": "At birth, the frontal bone consists of two halves. Union of the halves begins\nin the 2nd year. In most cases, the frontal suture is obliterated by the 8th year.\nHowever, in approximately 8% of people, a remnant of the frontal suture, the\nmetopic suture, persists (Figs. 8.2A and 8.3). Much less frequently, the entire\nsuture remains (Fig. B8.6C). A persistent suture must not be interpreted as a\nfracture in a radiograph or another medical image (e.g., a CT scan).\nThe posterior fontanelle is triangular and bounded by the parietal bones\nanteriorly and the occipital bone posteriorly. It is located at the junction of the\nlambdoid and sagittal sutures, the future site of lambda (Figs. 8.7A and 8.8C).\nThe posterior fontanelle begins to close during the first few months after birth,\nand by the end of the 1st year, it is small and no longer clinically palpable. The\nsphenoidal and mastoid fontanelles, overlain by the temporalis muscle (Fig.\n8.16A), fuse during infancy and are less important clinically than the midline\nfontanelles. The halves of the mandible fuse early in the 2nd year. The two\nmaxillae and nasal bones usually do not fuse.\nThe softness of the cranial bones in fetuses and their loose connections at\nthe sutures and fontanelles enable the shape of the cranium to be molded during\nbirth (Fig. B8.7). During passage of the fetus through the birth canal, the halves\nof the frontal bone become flat, the occipital bone is drawn out, and one parietal\nbone slightly overrides the other. Within a few days after birth, the shape of the\nneonatal cranium returns to normal. The resilience of the cranial bones of\ninfants allows them to resist forces that would produce fractures in adults. The\nfibrous sutures of the calvaria also permit the cranium to enlarge during infancy\nand childhood. The increase in the size of the calvaria is greatest during the first\n2 years, the period of most rapid brain development. The calvaria normally\nincreases in capacity for 15\u201316 years. After this, the calvaria usually increases\nslightly in size for 3\u20134 years due to bone thickening.\n1913"

The face provides our identity as an individual human.\nThus, birth defects, scarring, or other alterations resulting from pathology or\ntrauma have marked consequences beyond their physical effects.\nThe basic shape of the face is determined by the underlying bones. The\nindividuality of the face results primarily from anatomical variations in the shape\nand relative prominence of the features of the underlying cranium; in the\ndeposition of fatty tissue; in the color and effects of aging on the overlying skin;\nand in the abundance, nature, and placement of hair on the face and scalp. The\nrelatively large size of the buccal fat-pads in infants prevents collapse of the\ncheeks during sucking and produces their chubby-cheeked appearance. Growth\nof the facial bones takes longer than those of the calvaria. The ethmoid bone,\norbital cavities, and superior parts of the nasal cavities have nearly completed\ntheir growth by the 7th year. Expansion of the orbits and growth of the nasal\nseptum carry the maxillae infero-anteriorly. Considerable facial growth occurs\nduring childhood as the paranasal sinuses develop and permanent teeth erupt.\nThe face plays an important role in communication. Our interactions with\nothers take place largely via the face (including the ears) and thus the term\ninterface for a site of interactions. Whereas the shape and features of the face\nprovide our identity, much of our effect on others and their perceptions about us\nresult from the way we use facial muscles to make the slight alterations in the\nfeatures that constitute facial expression.\nScalp\nThe scalp consists of skin (normally hair bearing) and subcutaneous tissue that\ncover the neurocranium from the superior nuchal lines on the occipital bone to\nthe supra-orbital margins of the frontal bone (Figs. 8.3 and 8.4A).

Lateral to the angles of the mouth\nor commissures of the lips (the junctions of the upper and lower lips), fibers of\nas many as nine facial muscles interlace or merge in a highly variable and\nmultiplanar formation called the modiolus, which is largely responsible for the\noccurrence of dimples in many people.\nThe platysma (G. flat plate) is a broad, thin sheet of muscle in the\nsubcutaneous tissue of the neck (Fig. 8.16A, B; Table 8.3). The anterior borders\nof the two muscles decussate over the chin and blend with the facial muscles.\nActing from its superior attachment, the platysma tenses the skin, producing\nvertical skin ridges, conveying great stress, and releasing pressure on the\nsuperficial veins. Acting from its inferior attachment, the platysma helps depress\nthe mandible and draw the corners of the mouth inferiorly, as in a grimace.\nMUSCLES OF ORBITAL OPENING\nThe function of the eyelids (L. palpebrae) is to protect the eyeballs from injury\nand excessive light. The eyelids also keep the cornea moist by spreading the\ntears.\nThe orbicularis oculi closes the eyelids and wrinkles the forehead vertically\n(Figs. 8.16A, B and 8.18; Table 8.3). Its fibers sweep in concentric circles\naround the orbital margin and eyelids. Contraction of these fibers narrows the\npalpebral fissure (aperture between the eyelids) and assists the flow of lacrimal\nfluid (tears) by bringing the lids together laterally first, closing the palpebral\n1929"

Consequently, the skin must be carefully\nsutured to prevent scarring. The looseness of the subcutaneous tissue also\nenables fluid and blood to accumulate in the loose connective tissue following\nbruising of the face.\nSimilarly, facial inflammation causes considerable swelling (e.g., a beesting on\nthe root of the nose may close both eyes). As a person ages, the skin loses its\nresiliency (elasticity) resulting in ridges and wrinkles in the skin perpendicular\nto the direction of the facial muscle fibers. Skin incisions along these cleavage\nor wrinkle lines (Langer lines) heal with minimal scarring (see the clinical box\n\u201cSkin Incisions and Scarring,\u201d in Chapter 1, Overview and Basic Concepts).\n Scalp Injuries\nBecause the scalp arteries arising at the sides of the head are well protected by\ndense connective tissue and anastomose freely, a partially detached scalp may\nbe replaced with a reasonable chance of healing as long as one of the vessels\nsupplying the scalp remains intact. During an attached craniotomy (surgical\nremoval of a segment of the calvaria with a soft tissue scalp flap to expose the\ncranial cavity), the incisions are usually made convex and upward, and the\nsuperficial temporal artery is included in the tissue flap.\nThe scalp proper, the first three layers of the scalp (see Fig. 8.15A), is often\nregarded clinically as a single layer because they remain together when a scalp\nflap is made during a craniotomy and when part of the scalp is torn off (e.g.,\nduring an industrial accident). Nerves and vessels of the scalp enter inferiorly\nand ascend through layer two to the skin. Consequently, surgical pedicle scalp\nflaps are made so that they remain attached inferiorly to preserve the nerves and\nvessels, thereby promoting good healing.\nThe arteries of the scalp supply little blood to the calvaria, which is supplied\nby the middle meningeal arteries. Therefore, loss of the scalp does not produce\nnecrosis (death) of the calvarial bones.\n1950"

Because of the strength of\nthis aponeurosis, superficial scalp wounds do not gape, and the margins of the\nwound are held together. Furthermore, deep sutures are not necessary when\nsuturing superficial wounds because the epicranial aponeurosis does not allow\nwide separation of the skin. Deep scalp wounds gape widely when the\nepicranial aponeurosis is lacerated in the coronal plane because of the pull of\nthe frontal and occipital bellies of the occipitofrontalis muscle in opposite\ndirections (anteriorly and posteriorly).\n Scalp Infections\nThe loose connective tissue layer (layer four) of the scalp is the danger area of\nthe scalp because pus or blood spreads easily in it. Infection in this layer can\nalso pass into the cranial cavity through small emissary veins, which pass\nthrough parietal foramina in the calvaria, and reach intracranial structures such\nas the meninges (Fig. 8.8A, C). An infection cannot pass into the neck because\nthe occipital bellies of the occipitofrontalis muscle attach to the occipital bone\nand mastoid parts of the temporal bones (Fig. 8.16A). Neither can a scalp\ninfection spread laterally beyond the zygomatic arches because the epicranial\naponeurosis is continuous with the temporal fascia that attaches to these arches.\nAn infection or fluid (e.g., pus or blood) can enter the eyelids and the root of the\nnose because the occipitofrontalis inserts into the skin and subcutaneous tissue\nand does not attach to the bone (Fig. 8.16B). The skin of the eyelid is the\nthinnest of the body and is delicate and sensitive. Because of the loose nature of\nthe subcutaneous tissue within the eyelids, even a relatively slight injury or\ninflammation may result in an accumulation of fluid, causing the eyelids to\nswell.

Blood becomes trapped in this area, forming a cephalohematoma.\nThis benign condition frequently seen in neonates results from birth trauma that\nruptures multiple, minute periosteal arteries that nourish the bones of the\ncalvaria.\n Flaring of Nostrils\nThe actions of the nasalis muscles (Fig. 8.17, center top row) have generally\nbeen held as insignificant. However, observant clinicians study their action\nbecause of their diagnostic value (e.g., true nasal breathers can flare their\nnostrils distinctly).

The injection is made in the region of the infra-orbital foramen, by\nelevating the upper lip and passing the needle through the junction of the oral\nmucosa and gingiva at the superior aspect of the oral vestibule.\nTo determine where the infra-orbital nerve emerges, pressure is exerted on the\nmaxilla in the region of the infra-orbital foramen. Too much pressure on the\nnerve causes considerable pain. Because companion infra-orbital vessels leave\nthe infra-orbital foramen with the nerve, aspiration of the syringe during\ninjection prevents inadvertent injection of anesthetic fluid into a blood vessel.\nBecause the orbit is located just superior to the injection site, a careless\ninjection could result in passage of anesthetic fluid into the orbit, causing\ntemporary paralysis of the extra-ocular muscles.\n Mental and Incisive Nerve Blocks\nOccasionally, it is desirable to anesthetize one side of the skin and mucous\nmembrane of the lower lip and the skin of the chin (e.g., to suture a severe\nlaceration of the lip or chin).

It is\ncharacterized by sudden attacks of excruciating, lightening-like jabs of facial\npain. A paroxysm (sudden sharp pain) can last for 15 minutes or more. The pain\nmay be so intense that the person winces, thus the common term tic (twitch). In\nsome cases, the pain may be so severe that psychological changes occur,\nleading to depression and even suicide attempts.\nCN V2 is most frequently involved, then CN V3, and least frequently, CN V1.\nThe paroxysms are often set off by touching the face, brushing the teeth,\nshaving, drinking, or chewing. The pain is often initiated by touching an\nespecially sensitive trigger zone, frequently located around the tip of the nose or\nthe cheek (Haines, 2013). In trigeminal neuralgia, demyelination of axons in the\nsensory root occurs. In most cases, this is caused by pressure of a small aberrant\nartery (Kiernan, 2013). Often, when the aberrant artery is moved away from the\nsensory root of CN V, the symptoms disappear. Other scientists believe the\ncondition is caused by a pathological process affecting neurons in the trigeminal\nganglion.\nMedical or surgical treatment or both are used to alleviate the pain. In cases\ninvolving the CN V2, attempts have been made to block the infra-orbital nerve\nat the infra-orbital foramen using alcohol. This treatment usually relieves pain\ntemporarily. The simplest surgical procedure is avulsion or cutting of the\nbranches of the nerve at the infra-orbital foramen.\nOther treatments have used radiofrequency selective ablation of parts of the\ntrigeminal ganglion by a needle electrode passing through the cheek and\nforamen ovale. In some cases, it is necessary to section the sensory root for\nrelief of the pain. To prevent regeneration of nerve fibers, the sensory root of\nthe trigeminal nerve may be partially cut between the ganglion and the\nbrainstem (rhizotomy).

Lesions near the stylomastoid foramen\nresult in loss of motor function only (i.e., facial paralysis).\nFacial nerve palsy has many causes. The most common nontraumatic cause of\nfacial paralysis is inflammation of the facial nerve near the stylomastoid\nforamen (see Fig. 8.9A), often as a result of a viral infection. This produces\nedema (swelling) and compression of the nerve in the facial canal. Injury of the\nfacial nerve may result from fracture of the temporal bone. Facial paralysis is\nevident soon after the injury. If the nerve is completely sectioned, the chances\nof complete or even partial recovery are remote. Muscular movement usually\nimproves when the nerve damage is associated with blunt head trauma;\nhowever, recovery may not be complete (Russo et al., 2016). Facial nerve palsy\nmay be idiopathic (occurring without a known cause). However, it often follows\nexposure to cold, as occurs when riding in a car with a window open.\nFacial paralysis may be a complication of surgery; consequently,\nidentification of the facial nerve and its branches is essential during surgery\n(e.g., parotidectomy, removal of a parotid gland). The facial nerve is most\ndistinct as it emerges from the stylomastoid foramen. If necessary, electrical\nstimulation may be used for confirmation. Facial nerve palsy may also be\nassociated with dental manipulation, vaccination, pregnancy, HIV infection,\nLyme disease (inflammatory disorder causing headache and stiff neck), and\ninfections of the middle ear (otitis media).

Thus, birth or acquired\ndefects have consequences beyond their physical effects. \u2022 The individuality of\nthe face results primarily from anatomical variation. \u2022 The way in which the\nfacial muscles alter the basic features is critical to communication. \u2022 Lips and\nthe shape and degree of opening of the mouth are important components of\nspeech, but emphasis and subtleties of meaning are provided by our facial\nexpressions.\nStructure of scalp: The scalp is a somewhat mobile soft tissue mantle\ncovering the calvaria. \u2022 The primary subcutaneous component of the scalp is\nthe musculo-aponeurotic epicranius to which the overlying skin is firmly\nattached, but it is separated from the outer periosteum (pericranium) of the\ncranium by loose areolar tissue. \u2022 The areolar layer enables the mobility of the\nscalp over the calvaria and permits traumatic separation of the scalp from the\ncranium. \u2022 Attachment of the skin to the epicranial aponeurosis keeps the edges\nof superficial wounds together, but a wound that also penetrates the epicranial\naponeurosis gaps widely. \u2022 Blood may collect in the areolar space deep to the\naponeurosis after a head injury.\nMuscles of face and scalp: The facial muscles play important roles as the\ndilators and sphincters of the portals of the alimentary (digestive), respiratory,\nand visual systems (oral and palpebral fissures and nostrils), controlling what\nenters and some of what exits from our bodies. \u2022 Other facial muscles assist the\nmuscles of mastication by keeping food between the teeth during chewing. \u2022\nFleshy portions of the face (eyelids and cheeks) form dynamic containing walls\nfor the orbits and oral cavity. \u2022 Facial muscles are all derived from the second\npharyngeal arch and are therefore supplied by the nerve of this arch, the facial\nnerve (CN VII). \u2022 Facial muscles are subcutaneous, most having a skeletal\norigin and a cutaneous insertion. \u2022 The face lacks the deep fascia present\nelsewhere in the body.\nInnervation of face and scalp: The face is highly sensitive. It receives\nsensory innervation from the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). \u2022\nThe major terminal branches of each division reach the subcutaneous tissue of\neach side of the face via three foramina that are aligned vertically. \u2022 Each\ndivision supplies a distinct sensory zone, similar to a dermatome, but without\n1962"

Thus,\nbleeding from facial lacerations may be diffuse, with the lacerated vessel\nbleeding from both ends. \u2022 Most arteries of the face are branches or derivatives\nof branches of the external carotid artery; the arteries arising from the internal\ncarotid that supply the forehead are exceptions. \u2022 The main artery to the face is\nthe facial artery. \u2022 The arteries of the scalp are firmly embedded in the dense\nconnective tissue overlying the epicranial aponeurosis. Thus, when lacerated,\nthese arteries bleed from both ends, like those of the face, but are less able to\nconstrict or retract than other superficial vessels; therefore, profuse bleeding\nresults.\nThe veins of the face and scalp generally accompany arteries, providing a\nprimarily superficial venous drainage. \u2022 However, they also anastomose with\nthe pterygoid venous plexus and with dural venous sinuses via emissary veins,\nwhich provide a potentially dangerous route for the spread of infection. \u2022 Most\nnerves and vessels of the scalp run vertically toward the vertex; thus, a\nhorizontal laceration may produce more neurovascular damage than a vertical\none.\nThe lymphatic drainage of most of the face follows the venous drainage to\nlymph nodes around the base of the anterior part of the head (submandibular,\nparotid, and superficial cervical nodes). \u2022 An exception to this pattern is the\nlymph drainage of the central part of the lip and chin, which initially drains to\nthe submental lymph nodes.

The arachnoid is separated from the pia by the subarachnoid\n(leptomeningeal) space, which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid-\nfilled space helps maintain the balance of extracellular fluid in the brain. CSF is\na clear liquid similar to blood plasma in constitution. It provides nutrients but it\nhas less protein and a different ion concentration. CSF is formed by the choroid\nplexuses of the four ventricles of the brain (Fig. 8.28A). This fluid leaves the\nventricular system and enters the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and\npia mater, where it cushions and nourishes the brain.\nDura Mater\nThe cranial dura mater (dura), a thick, dense, bilaminar membrane, is also\ncalled the pachymeninx (G. pachy, thick + G. menix, membrane) (Fig. 8.28A).

Each superior\npetrosal sinus lies in the anterolateral attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli,\nwhich attaches to the superior border (crest) of the petrous part of the temporal\nbone (Fig. 8.30).\nThe inferior petrosal sinuses also commence at the posterior end of the\ncavernous sinus (Fig. 8.31A, B). Each inferior petrosal sinus runs in a groove\nbetween the petrous part of the temporal bone and the basilar part of the occipital\nbone (Fig. 8.30). The inferior petrosal sinuses drain the cavernous sinus directly\ninto the transition of the sigmoid sinus to the IJV at the jugular foramen (Fig.\n8.31B).

Emissary veins connect the dural venous sinuses with veins outside\nthe cranium. Although they are valveless and blood may flow in both directions,\nflow in the emissary veins is usually away from the brain. The size and number\nof emissary veins vary; many small ones are unnamed. A frontal emissary vein\nis present in children and some adults.

The derivation of the arachnoid\u2013pia from a single\nembryonic layer is indicated in the adult by the numerous web-like arachnoid\ntrabeculae passing between the arachnoid and pia, which give the arachnoid its\nname (G. arachne\u2013, spider, cobweb + G. eidos, resemblance). The trabeculae are\ncomposed of flattened, irregularly shaped fibroblasts that bridge the\nsubarachnoid space (Haines, 2013). The arachnoid and pia are in continuity\nimmediately proximal to the exit of each cranial nerve from the dura mater. The\ncranial arachnoid mater contains fibroblasts, collagen fibers, and some elastic\nfibers. Although thin, the arachnoid is thick enough to be manipulated with\nforceps. The avascular arachnoid, although closely applied to the meningeal\nlayer of the dura, is not attached to the dura. It is held against the inner surface of\nthe dura by the pressure of the CSF in the subarachnoid space.\nThe cranial pia mater is an even thinner membrane than the arachnoid. It is\nhighly vascularized by a network of fine blood vessels. The pia is difficult to see,\nbut it gives the surface of the brain a shiny appearance. The pia adheres to the\nsurface of the brain and follows all its contours. When the cerebral arteries\npenetrate the cerebral cortex, the pia follows them for a short distance, forming a\npial coat and a peri-arterial space (Fig. 8.35).\n1981"

            "Text": "BRAIN\nThe brain is the body\u2019s controller and coordinator of almost all of its functions. It\nis the organ that raised mankind to the summit of the animal world. It is a\ndelicate structure that is enclosed in a rigid cranium; however, it can be damaged\nby a blow to the head, compressed by a tumor, or deprived of oxygen by a leak\nor clot of blood in one of the cerebral arteries.\nBecause the brain is usually studied in detail in a separate neuroanatomy\ncourse, the brain is covered by only a superficial survey of its gross structure in\nthe typical anatomy course, with attention primarily concerned with the\nrelationship between the brain and its environment, that is, its meningeal\ncoverings, the CSF-filled subarachnoid space, and internal features of its bony\nencasement (neurocranium).\nBecause of their role in the production of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), the\nventricles of the brain and the CSF-producing choroid plexuses found there are\nalso covered. Furthermore, 11 of 12 cranial nerves arise from the brain (see\nChapter 10, Cranial Nerves).\nParts of Brain\nThe brain (contained by the neurocranium) is composed of the cerebrum,\ncerebellum, and brainstem (Fig. 8.36). When the calvaria and dura are removed,\ngyri (folds), sulci (grooves), and fissures (clefts) of the cerebral cortex are\nvisible through the delicate arachnoid\u2013pia layer. Whereas the gyri and sulci\ndemonstrate much variation, the other features of the brain, including overall\nbrain size, are remarkably consistent from individual to individual.\nThe cerebrum (L. brain) includes the cerebral hemispheres and basal\nganglia. The cerebral hemispheres, separated by the falx cerebri within the\nlongitudinal cerebral fissure, are the dominant features of the brain (Fig.\n8.36A\u2013C). Each cerebral hemisphere is divided for descriptive purposes into\nfour lobes, each of which is related to, but the boundaries of which do not\ncorrespond to, the overlying bones of the same name. From a superior view,\nthe cerebrum is essentially divided into quarters by the median longitudinal\ncerebral fissure and the coronal central sulcus (Fig. 8.36A). The central\nsulcus separates the frontal lobes (anteriorly) from the parietal lobes\n1995"

The posteriorly placed\noccipital lobes are separated from the parietal and temporal lobes by the\nplane of the parieto-occipital sulcus, visible on the medial surface of the\ncerebrum in a hemisected brain (Fig. 8.36C). The anteriormost points of the\nanteriorly projecting frontal and temporal lobes are the frontal and temporal\npoles. The posteriormost point of the posteriorly projecting occipital lobe is\nthe occipital pole. The hemispheres occupy the entire supratentorial cranial\ncavity (Fig. 8.31A, B). The frontal lobes occupy the anterior cranial fossae,\nthe temporal lobes occupy the lateral parts of the middle cranial fossae, and\nthe occipital lobes extend posteriorly over the tentorium cerebelli.\nThe diencephalon is composed of the epithalamus, thalamus, and\nhypothalamus and forms the central core of the brain (Fig. 8.36D).\nThe midbrain, the rostral part of the brainstem, lies at the junction of the\nmiddle and posterior cranial fossae. CN III and IV are associated with the\nmidbrain.\nThe pons is the part of the brainstem between the midbrain rostrally and the\nmedulla oblongata caudally. The pons lies in the anterior part of the posterior\ncranial fossa. CN V is associated with the pons (Fig. 8.36A, C, D).\nThe medulla oblongata (medulla) is the most caudal subdivision of the\nbrainstem that is continuous with the spinal cord. The medulla lies in the\nposterior cranial fossa. CN IX, X, and XII are associated with the medulla,\nwhereas CN VI\u2013VIII are associated with the junction of the pons and\nmedulla.\nThe cerebellum is the large brain mass lying posterior to the pons and\nmedulla and inferior to the posterior part of the cerebrum (Fig. 8.36A, C, D).\nIt lies beneath the tentorium cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa. It consists\nof two lateral hemispheres that are united by a narrow middle part, the\nvermis.\nVentricular System of Brain\nThe ventricular system of the brain consists of two lateral ventricles and the\nmidline 3rd and 4th ventricles connected by the cerebral aqueduct (Figs. 8.37\nand 8.38). CSF, largely secreted by the choroid plexuses of the ventricles, fills\nthese brain cavities and the subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord.\n1996"

The choroid\nplexuses consist of fringes of vascular pia mater (tela choroidea) covered by\ncuboidal epithelial cells. They are invaginated into the roofs of the 3rd and 4th\nventricles and on the floors of the bodies and inferior horns of the lateral\nventricles.\nCIRCULATION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID\nCSF leaves the lateral ventricles through the interventricular foramina and enters\nthe 3rd ventricle (Fig. 8.37A). From here, CSF passes through the cerebral\naqueduct into the 4th ventricle. Some CSF leaves this ventricle through its\nmedian and lateral apertures and enters the subarachnoid space, which is\ncontinuous around the spinal cord and posterosuperiorly over the cerebellum.\nHowever, most CSF flows into the interpeduncular and quadrigeminal cisterns.\nCSF from the various subarachnoid cisterns flows superiorly through the sulci\nand fissures on the medial and superolateral surfaces of the cerebral\nhemispheres. CSF also passes into the extensions of the subarachnoid space\naround the cranial nerves, the most important of which are the subarachnoid\nspace extensions surrounding the optic nerves (CN II).\nABSORPTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID\nThe main site of CSF absorption into the venous system is through the\narachnoid granulations (Figs. 8.35 and 8.37A), especially those that protrude\ninto the superior sagittal sinus and its lateral lacunae (Figs. 8.28D and 8.37A).\nThe subarachnoid space containing CSF extends into the cores of the arachnoid\ngranulations. CSF enters the venous system through two routes: (1) most CSF\nenters the venous system by transport through the cells of the arachnoid\ngranulations into the dural venous sinuses, and (2) some CSF moves between the\ncells making up the arachnoid granulations (Corbett et al., 2013).\nFUNCTIONS OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID\nAlong with the meninges and calvaria, CSF protects the brain by providing a\ncushion against blows to the head. The CSF in the subarachnoid space provides\nthe buoyancy that prevents the weight of the brain from compressing the cranial\nnerve roots and blood vessels against the internal surface of the cranium.\n1999"

In many places at the base of the brain, only the\ncranial meninges intervene between the brain and cranial bones. In the erect\nposition, the CSF is in the subarachnoid cisterns and sulci on the superior and\nlateral parts of the brain; therefore, CSF and dura normally separate the superior\npart of the brain from the calvaria (Fig. 8.37A).\nSmall, rapidly recurring changes take place in intracranial pressure owing\nto the beating heart; slow recurring changes result from unknown causes.\nMomentarily large changes in pressure occur during coughing and straining and\nduring changes in position (erect vs. supine). Any change in the volume of the\nintracranial contents, for example, a brain tumor, an accumulation of ventricular\nfluid caused by blockage of the cerebral aqueduct (see Fig. B8.20B), or blood\nfrom a ruptured aneurysm (a pathologically bulging artery) will be reflected by a\nchange in intracranial pressure.

Fractures in the\nfloor of the anterior cranial fossa may involve the cribriform plate of the\nethmoid (see Fig. 8.12A), resulting in CSF leakage through the nose (CSF\nrhinorrhea). CSF can be distinguished from mucus by testing its glucose level.\nThe glucose level of the CSF reflects that of the blood. CSF otorrhea and\nrhinorrhea may be the primary indications of a cranial base fracture and\nincreased risk of meningitis because an infection could spread to the meninges\nfrom the ear or nose (Louis, 2016).\n Anastomoses of Cerebral Arteries and\nCerebral Embolism\nBranches of the three cerebral arteries anastomose with each other on the\nsurface of the brain; however, if a cerebral artery is obstructed by a cerebral\nembolism (e.g., a blood clot), these microscopic anastomoses are not capable of\nproviding enough blood for the area of cerebral cortex concerned.\nConsequently, cerebral ischemia and infarction occur and an area of necrosis\n(dead tissue) results. Large cerebral emboli occluding major cerebral vessels\nmay cause severe neurologic problems and death.\n Variations of Cerebral Arterial Circle\nVariations in the size of the vessels forming the cerebral arterial circle are\ncommon. The posterior communicating arteries are absent in some individuals;\nin others, there may be two anterior communicating arteries. In approximately 1\nin 3 persons, one posterior cerebral artery is a major branch of the internal\ncarotid artery. One of the anterior cerebral arteries is often small in the proximal\npart of its course; the anterior communicating artery is larger than usual in these\nindividuals. These variations may become clinically significant if emboli or\narterial disease occur.\n2010"

            "Text": "Strokes\nA stroke is an acute disruption of the normal blood flow (hypoperfusion) of the\nbrain that results in the death of brain cells producing brain malfunction.\nStrokes are the most common neurologic disorders affecting adults in the\nUnited States. Worldwide, stroke accounts for approximately 10% of all deaths\n(Sevusch-Garcy, 2016); they are more often disabling than fatal. The cardinal\nfeature of a stroke is the sudden onset of neurological symptoms. There are two\nmain types of stroke: ischemic, due to impaired cerebral blood flow, and\nhemorrhagic, due to bleeding.\nIschemic strokes account for the great majority of strokes. In this type of stroke,\nfocal neurological deficits develop due to occlusive atherosclerotic disease (see\n\u201cBrain Infarction\u201d below) or thromboembolism in a cerebral artery. A thrombus\nis a clot developing within a blood vessel, and an embolus a clot or plug formed\nelsewhere that travels to and becomes lodged in a blood vessel.\nThe cerebral arterial circle is an important means of collateral circulation in\nthe event of gradual obstruction of one of the major arteries forming the circle.\nSudden occlusion, even if only partial, results in neurological deficits. In elderly\npersons, the anastomoses of the arterial circle are often inadequate when a large\nartery (e.g., the internal carotid) is occluded, even if the occlusion is gradual (in\nwhich case function is impaired at least to some degree).\nHemorrhagic stroke follows leakage or rupture of an intracerebral artery or\na saccular aneurysm of a subarachnoid artery, a sac-like dilation on a weak part\nof the arterial wall (Fig. B8.21A). The most common type of saccular aneurysm\nis a berry aneurysm, occurring in the vessels of or near the cerebral arterial\ncircle and the medium arteries at the base of the brain (Fig. B8.21B).\nAneurysms also occur at the bifurcation of the basilar artery into the posterior\ncerebral arteries.\n2011"

The\nchoroid attaches firmly to the pigment layer of the retina, but can easily be\nstripped from the sclera. The choroid is continuous anteriorly with the ciliary\nbody.\nThe ciliary body is a ring-like thickening of the vascular layer posterior to\nthe corneoscleral junction that is muscular as well as vascular (Figs. 8.49B and\n8.50). It connects the choroid with the circumference of the iris. The ciliary body\nprovides attachment for the lens. The contraction and relaxation of the circularly\narranged smooth muscle of the ciliary body controls the thickness, and therefore\nthe focus, of the lens. Folds on the internal surface of the ciliary body, the ciliary\nprocesses, secrete aqueous humor.

When a person is awake, the size of the pupil\nvaries continually to regulate the amount of light entering the eye (Fig. 8.51B).\nTwo involuntary muscles control the size of the pupil: the parasympathetically\nstimulated, circularly arranged sphincter pupillae decreases its diameter\n(constrict or contracts the pupil, pupillary miosis), and the sympathetically\nstimulated, radially arranged dilator pupillae increases its diameter (dilates the\npupil). The nature of the pupillary responses is paradoxical: sympathetic\nresponses usually occur immediately, yet it may take up to 20 minutes for the\npupil to dilate in response to low lighting, as in a darkened theater.\nParasympathetic responses are typically slower than sympathetic responses, yet\nparasympathetically stimulated papillary constriction is normally instantaneous.\nAbnormal sustained pupillary dilation (mydriasis) may occur in certain diseases\nor as a result of trauma or the use of certain drugs.\n2031"

Grossly, the retina consists of two functional\nparts with distinct locations: an optic part and a nonvisual retina. The optic part\nof the retina is sensitive to visual light rays and has two layers: a neural layer\nand pigmented layer. The neural layer is light receptive. The pigmented layer\nconsists of a single layer of cells that reinforces the light-absorbing property of\nthe choroid in reducing the scattering of light in the eyeball. The nonvisual\nretina is an anterior continuation of the pigmented layer and a layer of\nsupporting cells. The nonvisual retina extends over the ciliary body (ciliary part\nof the retina) and the posterior surface of the iris (iridial part of the retina), to\nthe pupillary margin.\nClinically, the internal aspect of the posterior part of the eyeball, where light\nentering the eyeball is focused, is referred to as the fundus of the eyeball (ocular\nfundus). The retina of the fundus includes a distinctive circular area called the\noptic disc (optic papilla), where the sensory fibers and vessels conveyed by the\noptic nerve (CN II) enter the eyeball (Figs. 8.49C, 8.50A and 8.52).

Except for the cones and rods of the neural layer, the retina is supplied\nby the central retinal artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery.

The\ncornea is the primary refractory medium of the eyeball, that is, it bends light to\nthe greatest degree, focusing an inverted image on the light-sensitive retina of\nthe fundus of the eyeball.\nThe aqueous humor (\u201caqueous\u201d) occupies the anterior segment of the\neyeball (Figs. 8.50B and 8.51A).

Although most refraction is produced by the\ncornea, the convexity of the lens, particularly its anterior surface, constantly\nvaries to fine-tune the focus of near or distant objects on the retina (Fig. 8.53).\nThe isolated unattached lens assumes a nearly spherical shape. In other words, in\nthe absence of external attachment and stretching, it becomes nearly round. The\nciliary muscle of the ciliary body changes the shape of the lens. In the absence\nof nerve stimulation, the diameter of the relaxed muscular ring is larger. The lens\nsuspended within the ring is under tension as its periphery is stretched, causing it\nto be thinner (less convex). The less convex lens brings more distant objects into\nfocus (far vision). Parasympathetic stimulation via the oculomotor nerve (CN\nIII) causes sphincter-like contraction of the ciliary muscle. The ring becomes\nsmaller, and tension on the lens is reduced. The relaxed lens thickens (becomes\nmore convex), bringing near objects into focus (near vision). The active process\nof changing the shape of the lens for near vision is called accommodation.

            "Text": "RECTI AND OBLIQUE MUSCLES\nThe four recti muscles (L. rectos, straight) run anteriorly to the eyeball, arising\nfrom a fibrous cuff, the common tendinous ring, that surrounds the optic canal\nand from part of the superior orbital fissure at the apex of the orbit (Figs. 8.54B,\nC and 8.55A). Structures that enter the orbit through the optic canal and the\nadjacent part of the fissure lie initially within the cone of recti (Figs. 8.54B, C\nand 8.55B). The four recti muscles are named for their individual positions\nrelative to the eyeball. Because they mainly run anteriorly to attach to the\nsuperior, inferior, medial, and lateral aspects of the eyeball anterior to its\nequator, the primary actions of the four recti in producing elevation, depression,\nadduction, and abduction are relatively intuitive.\nSeveral factors make the actions of the obliques and the secondary actions of\nthe superior and inferior recti more challenging to understand. The apex of the\norbit is medially placed relative to the orbit, so that the axis of the orbit does not\ncoincide with the optical axis (Figs. 8.44A and 8.54C). Therefore, when the eye\nis in the primary position, the superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR)\nmuscles also approach the eyeball from its medial side, their line of pull passing\nmedial to the vertical axis. This gives both muscles a secondary action of\nadduction. The SR and IR also extend laterally, passing superior and inferior to\nthe AP axis, respectively, giving the SR a secondary action of medial rotation,\nand the IR a secondary action of lateral rotation.\nIf the gaze is first directed laterally (abducted by the lateral rectus [LR]) so\nthat the line of gaze coincides with the plane of the IR and SR, the SR produces\nelevation only (and is solely responsible for the movement) (Fig. 8.56A), and the\nIR produces depression only (and is likewise solely responsible) (Fig. 8.56B).\nDuring a physical examination, the physician directs the patient to follow his or\nher finger laterally (testing the LR and abducent nerve [CN VI]), then superiorly\nand inferiorly to isolate and test the function of the SR and IR and the integrity\nof the oculomotor nerve (CN III), which supplies both (Fig. 8.56E).\nThe inferior oblique (IO) is the only muscle to originate from the anterior\npart of the orbit (immediately lateral to the lacrimal fossa) (Fig. 8.47B). The\nsuperior oblique (SO) originates from the apex region like the rectus muscles\n(but super medial to the common tendinous ring) (Fig. 8.55A). However, its\ntendon traverses the trochlea just inside the super medial orbital rim, redirecting\nits line of pull (Figs. 8.54B, C and 8.55B). Therefore, the inserting tendons of the\noblique muscles lie in the same oblique vertical plane. When the inserting\n2045"

Because they pass inferior and superior to the AP axis as they pass\nlaterally, the IO is the primary lateral rotator, and the SO is the primary medial\nrotator of the eye. However, in the primary position, the obliques also pass\nposteriorly across the transverse axis (Fig. 8.54B) and posterior to the vertical\naxis (Fig. 8.54C), giving the SO a secondary function as a depressor, the IO a\nsecondary function as an elevator, and both muscles a secondary function as\nabductors (Fig. 8.54B, C).\nIf the gaze is first directed medially (adducted by the medial rectus [MR])\nso that the line of gaze coincides with plane of the inserting tendons of the SO\nand IO, the SO produces depression only (and is solely responsible for the\nmovement) (Fig. 8.56C), and the IO produces elevation only (and is likewise\nsolely responsible) (Fig. 8.56D). During a physical examination, the physician\ndirects the patient to follow his or her finger medially (testing the MR and\noculomotor nerve) and then inferiorly and superiorly to isolate and test the\nfunctions of the SO and IO and the integrity of the trochlear nerve (CN IV),\nwhich supplies the SO, and of the inferior division of CN III, which supplies the\nIO (Fig. 8.56E). In practice\nthe main action of the superior oblique is depression of the pupil in the\nadducted position (e.g., directing the gaze down the page when the gaze of\nboth eyes is directed medially [converged] for reading).\nthe main action of the inferior oblique is elevation of the pupil in the\nadducted position (e.g., directing the gaze up the page during convergence\nfor reading).\nAlthough the actions produced by the extra-ocular muscles have been\nconsidered individually, all motions require the action of several muscles in the\nsame eye, assisting each other as synergists or opposing each other as\nantagonists. Muscles that are synergistic for one action may be antagonistic for\nanother. For example, no single muscle can act to elevate the pupil directly from\nthe primary position (Fig. 8.54D). The two elevators (SR and IO) act as\nsynergists to do so. However, these muscles are antagonistic as rotators and so\nneutralize each other so that no rotation occurs as they work together to elevate\nthe pupil. Similarly, no single muscle can act to depress the pupil directly from\nthe primary position. The two depressors, the SO and IR, both produce\n2046"

Triangular expansions from the sheaths of the\nmedial and lateral rectus muscles, called the medial and lateral check\nligaments, are attached to the lacrimal and zygomatic bones, respectively. These\nligaments limit abduction and adduction. A blending of the check ligaments with\nthe fascia of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles forms a hammock-\nlike sling, the suspensory ligament of the eyeball. A similar inferior check\nligament from the fascial sheath of the inferior rectus retracts the inferior eyelid\nwhen the gaze is directed downward (Fig. 8.45A). Collectively, the check\nligaments act with the oblique muscles and the retrobulbar fat to resist the\nposterior pull on the eyeball produced by the rectus muscles. In diseases or\nstarvation that reduce the retrobulbar fat, the eyeball is retracted into the orbit\n(inophthalmos).\nNerves of Orbit\nThe large optic nerves convey purely sensory nerves that transmit impulses\ngenerated by optical stimuli (Figs. 8.45A and 8.50A). They are cranial nerves\n(CN II) by convention, but develop as paired anterior extensions of the forebrain,\nand therefore are central nervous system (CNS) fiber tracts formed of second-\norder neurons. The optic nerves begin at the lamina cribrosa of the sclera,\nwhere the unmyelinated nerve fibers pierce the sclera and become myelinated,\nposterior to the optic disc. They exit the orbits via the optic canals. Throughout\ntheir course in the orbit, the optic nerves are surrounded by extensions of the\ncranial meninges and subarachnoid space, the latter occupied by a thin layer of\nCSF (Fig. 8.45A, inset). The intra-orbital extensions of the cranial dura and\narachnoid constitute the optic nerve sheath, which becomes continuous\nanteriorly with the fascial sheath of the eyeball and the sclera. A layer of pia\nmater covers the surface of the optic nerve within the sheath.\nIn addition to the optic nerve (CN II), the nerves of the orbit include those\nthat enter through the superior orbital fissure and supply the ocular muscles:\noculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), and abducent (CN VI) nerves (Figs.\n8.55 and 8.57). A memory device for the innervation of the extra-ocular muscles\nmoving the eyeball is similar to a chemical formula: LR6SO4AO3 (lateral rectus,\nCN VI; superior oblique, CN IV; all others, CN III). The trochlear and abducent\nnerves pass directly to the single muscle supplied by each nerve. The oculomotor\nnerve divides into a superior and an inferior division.

As it evaginates from\nthe forebrain (Fig. B8.24B), the optic vesicle carries the developing meninges\nwith it. Hence, the optic nerve is invested with cranial meninges and an\nextension of the subarachnoid space (Fig. B8.24C). The central retinal artery\nand vein cross the subarachnoid space and run within the distal part of the optic\nnerve. The pigment cell layer of the retina develops from the outer layer of the\noptic cup, and the neural layer develops from the inner layer of the cup (Moore\net al., 2016).\n2060"

This reflex, involving CN II (afferent limb) and CN III (efferent\nlimb), is the rapid constriction of the pupil in response to light. When light\nenters one eye, both pupils constrict because each retina sends fibers into the\noptic tracts of both sides. The sphincter pupillae muscle is innervated by\nparasympathetic fibers. Consequently, interruption of these fibers causes\ndilation of the pupil because of the unopposed action of the sympathetically\ninnervated dilator pupillae muscle.

Infection of the gland causes inflammation\n(parotiditis) and swelling of the gland, visible as marked distension of the\ncheek. Severe pain occurs because the parotid sheath resists swelling. Often, the\npain is worse during chewing because the enlarged gland is wrapped around the\nposterior border of the ramus of the mandible and is compressed against the\nmastoid process of the temporal bone when the mouth is opened. The mumps\nvirus may also cause inflammation of the parotid duct, producing redness of the\nparotid papilla, the small projection at the opening of the duct into the superior\noral vestibule (Fig. 8.65). Because the pain produced by mumps may be\nconfused with a toothache, redness of the papilla is often an early sign that the\ndisease involves the parotid gland and not a tooth.\nParotid gland disease often causes pain in the auricle and external acoustic\nmeatus of the external ear, the temporal region, and TMJ because the\nauriculotemporal and great auricular nerves, from which the parotid gland and\nsheath receive sensory fibers, also supply sensory fibers to the skin over the\ntemporal fossa and auricle.\n Abscess in Parotid Gland\nA bacterial infection localized in the parotid gland usually produces an abscess\n(pus formation).

This technique (sialography) is followed by\nradiography of the gland. Parotid sialograms (G. sialon, saliva + G. grapho, to\nwrite) demonstrate parts of the parotid duct system that may be displaced or\ndilated by disease.\n Blockage of Parotid Duct\nThe parotid duct may be blocked by a calcified deposit, called a sialolith or\ncalculus (L. pebble). The resulting pain in the parotid gland is made worse by\neating. Sucking a lemon slice is painful because of the buildup of saliva in the\nproximal part of the blocked parotid duct.\n Accessory Parotid Gland\nSometimes, an additional accessory parotid gland lies on the masseter muscle\nbetween the parotid duct and the zygomatic arch. Several ducts open from this\naccessory gland into the parotid duct.\n Mandibular Nerve Block\nTo produce a mandibular nerve block, an anesthetic agent is injected near the\nmandibular nerve where it enters the infratemporal fossa (Fig. 8.67B). In the\nextra-oral approach, the needle passes through the mandibular notch of the\nramus of the mandible into the infratemporal fossa.

The site of the anesthetic injection is around the mandibular\nforamen, the opening into the mandibular canal on the medial aspect of the\nramus of the mandible (Fig. 8.75). This canal gives passage to the inferior\nalveolar nerve, artery, and vein. When this nerve block is successful, all\nmandibular teeth are anesthetized to the median plane. The skin and mucous\nmembrane of the lower lip, the labial alveolar mucosa and gingivae, and the\nskin of the chin are also anesthetized because they are supplied by the mental\nnerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve (Fig. 8.79A). There are possible\nproblems associated with an inferior alveolar nerve block, such as injection of\nthe anesthetic into the parotid gland or the medial pterygoid muscle. This would\naffect ability to open the mouth (pterygoid trismus).\n Dislocation of Temporomandibular Joint\n(TMJ)\nSometimes during yawning or taking a large bite, excessive contraction of the\nlateral pterygoids may cause the heads of the mandible to dislocate anteriorly\n(pass anterior to the articular tubercles) (Fig. B8.31).

The lesser\npalatine foramina posterior to the greater palatine foramen pierce the pyramidal\nprocess of the palatine bone. These foramina transmit the lesser palatine nerves\nand vessels to the soft palate and adjacent structures (Fig. 8.87).\nSOFT PALATE\nThe soft palate is the movable posterior third of the palate and is suspended\nfrom the posterior border of the hard palate (Figs. 8.83 and 8.84B). The soft\npalate has no bony skeleton; however, its anterior aponeurotic part is\nstrengthened by the palatine aponeurosis, which attaches to the posterior edge\nof the hard palate. The aponeurosis is thick anteriorly and thin posteriorly, where\nit blends with a posterior muscular part of the soft palate. Postero-inferiorly, the\nsoft palate has a curved free margin from which hangs a conical process, the\nuvula.\nWhen swallowing, the soft palate is initially tensed to allow the tongue to\npress against it, squeezing the bolus (masticated mass) of food to the back of the\nmouth. The soft palate is then elevated posteriorly and superiorly against the\nwall of the pharynx, thereby preventing passage of food into the nasal cavity.\nLaterally, the soft palate is continuous with the wall of the pharynx and is\njoined to the tongue and pharynx by the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal\narches, respectively (Fig. 8.83).

(Part A\nCourtesy of Dr. B. Liebgott, Professor, Division of Anatomy,\nDepartment of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada.)\nDeep to the mucosa of the palate are mucus-secreting palatine glands (Fig.\n8.85B). The openings of the ducts of these glands give the palatine mucosa a\npitted (orange-peel) appearance. In the midline, posterior to the maxillary incisor\nteeth, is the incisive papilla. This elevation of the mucosa lies directly anterior\nto the underlying incisive fossa (Fig. 8.84A).\nRadiating laterally from the incisive papilla are several parallel transverse\npalatine folds or rugae (Fig. 8.85A, B). These folds assist with manipulation of\nfood during mastication. Passing posteriorly in the midline of the palate from the\nincisive papilla is a narrow whitish streak, the palatine raphe. It may present as\na ridge anteriorly and a groove posteriorly. The palatine raphe marks the site of\nfusion of the embryonic palatal processes (palatal shelves) (Moore et al., 2016).\nYou can feel the transverse palatine folds and the palatine raphe with your\ntongue.\nMUSCLES OF SOFT PALATE\nThe soft palate may be elevated so that it is in contact with the posterior wall of\nthe pharynx. This closes the isthmus of the pharynx, requiring that one breathes\nthrough the mouth. The soft palate may also be drawn inferiorly so that it is in\ncontact with the posterior part of the tongue. This closes the isthmus of the\nfauces, so that expired air passes through the nose (even when the mouth is\nopen) and prevents substances in the oral cavity from passing to the pharynx.\nTensing the soft palate pulls it tight at an intermediate level so that the tongue\nmay push against it, compressing masticated food and propelling it into the\npharynx for swallowing.\nThe five muscles of the soft palate arise from the base of the cranium and\ndescend to the palate.

The conchae (L.\nshells) or turbinates of many mammals (especially running mammals and those\nexisting in extreme environments) are highly convoluted, scroll-like structures\nthat offer a vast surface area for heat exchange. In both humans with simple\nplate-like nasal conchae and animals with complex turbinates, a recess or nasal\nmeatus (singular and plural; passage(s) in the nasal cavity) underlies each of the\nbony formations. The nasal cavity is therefore divided into five passages: a\nposterosuperiorly placed spheno-ethmoidal recess, three laterally located nasal\nmeatus (superior, middle, and inferior), and a medially placed common nasal\nmeatus into which the four lateral passages open. The inferior concha is the\nlongest and broadest of the conchae and is formed by an independent bone (of\nthe same name, inferior concha) covered by a mucous membrane that contains\nlarge vascular spaces that can enlarge affecting the caliber of the nasal cavity.\nThe middle and superior conchae are medial processes of the ethmoid bone.\nWhen infected or irritated, the mucosa covering the conchae may swell rapidly,\nblocking the nasal passage(s) on that side.\nThe spheno-ethmoidal recess, lying superoposterior to the superior concha,\nreceives the opening of the sphenoidal sinus, an air-filled cavity in the body of\nthe sphenoid.

Septal branch of the superior labial artery (from the facial artery).\nThe first three arteries divide into lateral and medial (septal) branches. The\ngreater palatine artery reaches the septum via the incisive canal through the\nanterior hard palate. The anterior part of the nasal septum is the site of an\nanastomotic arterial plexus involving all five arteries supplying the septum\n(Kiesselbach area). The external nose also receives blood from first and fifth\narteries listed above, plus nasal branches of the infra-orbital artery and the lateral\nnasal branches of the facial artery.\nA rich submucosal venous plexus, deep to the nasal mucosa, provides\nvenous drainage of the nose via the sphenopalatine, facial, and ophthalmic veins.\nThe plexus is an important part of the body\u2019s thermoregulatory system,\nexchanging heat and warming air before it enters the lungs. Venous blood from\nthe external nose drains mostly into the facial vein via the angular and lateral\nnasal veins (see Fig. 8.25). However, recall that it lies within the \u201cdanger area\u201d\nof the face because of communications with the cavernous (dural venous) sinus\n(see the clinical box \u201cThrombophlebitis of Facial Vein\u201d).\nRegarding the nerve supply of the nose, the nasal mucosa can be divided into\npostero-inferior and anterosuperior portions by an oblique line passing\napproximately through the anterior nasal spine and the spheno-ethmoidal recess\n(Fig. 8.106). The nerve supply of the postero-inferior portion of the nasal\nmucosa is chiefly from the maxillary nerve, by way of the nasopalatine nerve to\nthe nasal septum, and posterior superior lateral nasal and inferior lateral nasal\nbranches of the greater palatine nerve to the lateral wall. The nerve supply of the\nanterosuperior portion is from the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) by way of the\nanterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves, branches of the nasociliary nerve.\nMost of the external nose (dorsum and apex) is also supplied by CN V1 (via the\ninfratrochlear nerve and the external nasal branch of the anterior ethmoidal\nnerve). However, the alae of the nose are supplied by the nasal branches of the\ninfra-orbital nerve (CN V2). The olfactory nerves, concerned with smell, arise\nfrom cells in the olfactory epithelium in the superior part of the lateral and\nseptal walls of the nasal cavity. The central processes of these cells (forming the\nolfactory nerve) pass through the cribriform plate and end in the olfactory bulb,\nthe rostral expansion of the olfactory tract (Fig. 8.102A).\n2172"

Only\nthin plates of bone separate the sinuses from several important structures: the\noptic nerves and optic chiasm, the pituitary gland, the internal carotid arteries,\nand the cavernous sinuses. The sphenoidal sinuses are derived from a posterior\nethmoidal cell that begins to invade the sphenoid at approximately 2 years of\nage. In some people, several posterior ethmoidal cells invade the sphenoid,\ngiving rise to multiple sphenoidal sinuses that open separately into the spheno-\nethmoidal recess (Fig. 8.103A). The posterior ethmoidal arteries and the\nposterior ethmoidal nerves that accompany the arteries supply the sphenoidal\nsinuses (Fig. 8.105).\nMAXILLARY SINUSES\nThe maxillary sinuses are the largest of the paranasal sinuses.

Spread of\ninfection from these cells could also affect the dural sheath of the optic nerve,\ncausing optic neuritis.\n Infection of Maxillary Sinuses\nThe maxillary sinuses are the most commonly infected, probably because their\nostia (openings) are commonly small and are located high on their superomedial\nwalls (Fig. 8.108). When the mucous membrane of the sinus is congested, the\nmaxillary ostia are often obstructed. Because of the high location of the ostia,\nwhen the head is erect, it is impossible for the sinuses to drain until they are\nfull. Because the ostia of the right and left sinuses lie on the medial sides (i.e.,\nare directed toward each other), when lying on one\u2019s side only the upper sinus\n(e.g., the right sinus if lying on the left side) drains. A cold or allergy involving\nboth sinuses can result in nights of rolling from side to side in an attempt to\nkeep the sinuses drained. A maxillary sinus can be cannulated and drained by\npassing a cannula from the naris through the maxillary ostium into the sinus.\n Relationship of Teeth to Maxillary Sinus\nThe close proximity of the three maxillary molar teeth to the floor of the\nmaxillary sinus poses potentially serious problems. During removal of a\nmaxillary molar tooth, a fracture of a root of the tooth may occur. If proper\nretrieval methods are not used, a piece of the root may be driven superiorly into\nthe maxillary sinus creating a communication between the oral cavity and the\nsinus. This may result in a sinus infection.

The anterior carotid wall separates the tympanic cavity from the carotid\ncanal; superiorly, it has the opening of the pharyngotympanic tube and the\ncanal for the tensor tympani.\n7. The mastoid antrum is a cavity in the mastoid process of the temporal bone\n(Fig. 8.114A). The antrum (L. from G., cave), like the tympanic cavity, is\nseparated from the middle cranial fossa by a thin plate of the temporal bone,\ncalled the tegmen tympani.

The pharyngotympanic tube is lined by\nmucous membrane that is continuous posteriorly with that of the tympanic cavity\nand anteriorly with that of the nasopharynx.\nThe function of the pharyngotympanic tube is to equalize pressure in the\nmiddle ear with the atmospheric pressure, thereby allowing free movement of the\ntympanic membrane. By allowing air to enter and leave the tympanic cavity, this\ntube balances the pressure on both sides of the membrane. Because the walls of\nthe cartilaginous part of the tube are normally in apposition, the tube must be\nactively opened.

The long limb lies parallel to the handle of the malleus,\nand its interior end articulates with the stapes by way of the lenticular process, a\nmedially directed projection. The short limb is connected by a ligament to the\nposterior wall of the tympanic cavity.\nStapes. The stapes (L. stirrup) is the smallest ossicle. It has a head, two\nlimbs, and a base (Fig. 8.116D). Its head, directed laterally, articulates with the\nincus (Fig. 8.116A). The base (footplate) of the stapes fits into the oval window\non the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. The oval base is attached to the\nmargins of the oval window. The base of the stapes is considerably smaller than\nthe tympanic membrane; as a result, the vibratory force of the stapes is increased\napproximately 10 times over that of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, the\nauditory ossicles increase the force but decrease the amplitude of the vibrations\ntransmitted from the tympanic membrane through the ossicles to the internal ear\n(see Fig. 8.120).\nMuscles Associated with Auditory Ossicles. Two muscles dampen or resist\nmovements of the auditory ossicles; one also dampens movements (vibration) of\nthe tympanic membrane. The tensor tympani is a short muscle that arises from\nthe superior surface of the cartilaginous part of the pharyngotympanic tube, the\ngreater wing of the sphenoid, and the petrous part of the temporal bone (Figs.\n8.113A and 8.114). The muscle inserts into the handle of the malleus and pulls\nthe handle medially, which tenses the tympanic membrane, reducing the\namplitude of its oscillations. This action tends to prevent damage to the internal\near when one is exposed to loud sounds. The tensor tympani is supplied by the\nmandibular nerve (CN V3).\nThe stapedius is a tiny muscle inside the pyramidal eminence (pyramid), a\nhollow, cone-shaped prominence on the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity\n(Figs. 8.112B and 8.114B). The tendon of the stapedius enters the tympanic\ncavity by emerging from a pinpoint foramen in the apex of the eminence and\ninserts on the neck of the stapes. The stapedius pulls the stapes posteriorly and\ntilts its base in the oval window, thereby tightening the anular ligament and\nreducing the oscillatory range. It also prevents excessive movement of the\nstapes. The nerve to the stapedius arises from the facial nerve (CN VII).\n2197"

The\nmaculae are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration or deceleration. Hair\ncells (nonneuronal mechanoreceptors stimulated by the deflection of sensory\nhairs, or stereocilia) in the maculae are innervated by fibers of the vestibular\ndivision of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), the vestibular nerve. The cell\nbodies of the primary sensory neurons are in the vestibular ganglion (Fig.\n8.119) in the internal acoustic meatus.\nFIGURE 8.119. Vestibulocochlear nerve. CN VIII has two\nparts: the cochlear nerve (the nerve of hearing) and the\nvestibular nerve (the nerve of balance). The cell bodies of the\nsensory fibers that make up the two parts of this nerve constitute\nthe spiral and vestibular ganglia.\nThe endolymphatic duct traverses the vestibular aqueduct (Fig. 8.113B) and\nemerges through the bone of the posterior cranial fossa, where it expands into a\nblind pouch, the endolymphatic sac (Figs. 8.113B, 8.117C, and 8.119).

A localized collection of blood forms between the perichondrium\nand auricular cartilage, causing distortion of the contours of the auricle.

This tube is easily blocked by swelling of\nits mucous membrane, even as a result of mild infections (e.g., a cold), because\nthe walls of its cartilaginous part are normally already in apposition. When the\npharyngotympanic tube is occluded, residual air in the tympanic cavity is\nusually absorbed into the mucosal blood vessels, resulting in lower pressure in\nthe tympanic cavity, retraction of the tympanic membrane, and interference\nwith its free movement. Finally, hearing is affected.\n Paralysis of Stapedius\nThe tympanic muscles have a protective action in that they dampen large\nvibrations of the tympanic membrane resulting from loud noises. Paralysis of\nthe stapedius (e.g., resulting from a lesion of the facial nerve) is associated with\nexcessive acuteness of hearing, called hyperacusis or hyperacusia.

Tinnitus and hearing loss may result\nfrom lesions anywhere in the peripheral or central auditory pathways. The two\ntypes of hearing loss are as follows:\nConductive hearing loss: resulting from anything in the external or middle\near that interferes with conduction of sound or movement of the oval or\nround windows. People with this type of hearing loss often speak with a soft\nvoice because, to them, their own voices sound louder than background\nsounds. This type of hearing loss may be improved surgically or by use of a\nhearing aid device.\nSensorineural hearing loss: resulting from defects in the pathway from the\ncochlea to the brain: defects of the cochlea, cochlear nerve, brainstem, or\ncortical connections. Cochlear implants are one approach employed to\nrestore sound perception when the hair cells of the spiral organ have been\ndamaged (Fig. B8.45).

The neck joins the head to the trunk and limbs, serving as\na major conduit for structures passing between them. In addition, several\nimportant organs with unique functions are located here: the larynx and the\nthyroid and parathyroid glands, for example.\nThe neck is relatively slender to allow the flexibility necessary to position\nthe head to maximize the efficiency of its sensory organs (mainly the eyeballs\nbut also the ears, mouth, and nose). Thus, many important structures are crowded\ntogether in the neck, such as muscles, glands, arteries, veins, nerves, lymphatics,\ntrachea, esophagus, and vertebrae. Consequently, the neck is a well-known\nregion of vulnerability. Furthermore, several vital structures, including the\ntrachea, esophagus, and thyroid gland, lack the bony protection afforded other\nparts of the systems to which these structures belong.\nThe main arterial blood flow to the head and neck (the carotid arteries) and\nthe principal venous drainage (the jugular veins) lie anterolaterally in the neck\n(Fig. 9.1).

            "Text": "2. Acting antagonistically with the extensors of the neck (i.e., the deep cervical\nmuscles), bilateral contraction of the SCMs can flex the lower neck while\nproducing limited extension at the AO joint and upper neck, protruding the\nchin while keeping the head level. Such flexion movements also occur when\nlifting the head off the ground while lying supine (with gravity providing the\nresistance in place of the deep cervical muscles).\nIt is probable that most of the time smaller synergistic muscles and/or\neccentric contraction (controlled relaxation of the muscle, gradually yielding to\ngravity) are involved in initiating flexion or extension, with the SCMs providing\nthe power and range of movement once initiated.\nActing unilaterally, the SCM laterally flexes the neck (bends the neck\nsideways) and rotates the head so the ear approaches the shoulder of the\nipsilateral (same) side while elevating and rotating the chin toward the\ncontralateral (opposite) side. If the head and neck are fixed, bilateral contraction\nof the SCMs elevates the clavicles and manubrium and thus the anterior ribs. In\nthis way, the SCMs act as accessory muscles of respiration in assisting\nproduction of the pump-handle movement of the thoracic wall.\nTo test the SCM, the head is turned to the opposite side against resistance\n(hand against chin). If it is acting normally, the SCM can be seen and palpated.\nPosterior Cervical Region\nThe region posterior to the anterior borders of (i.e., corresponding to the area of)\nthe trapezius is the posterior cervical region (Fig. 9.7; Table 9.1). The\nsuboccipital region is deep to the superior part of this region (see Fig. 9.8). The\ntrapezius is a large, flat triangular muscle that covers the posterolateral aspect of\nthe neck and thorax (Fig. 9.8F).

It then crosses the third part of the\nsubclavian artery and the cords of the brachial plexus to pass posterior to the\nclavicle to supply muscles on the posterior aspect of the scapula. Alternately, the\nsuprascapular artery may arise directly from the third part of the subclavian\nartery.\nAlso, arising laterally, the cervicodorsal trunk (Weiglein et al., 2005),\nsometimes known as the transverse cervical artery, further bifurcates into the\nsuperficial cervical artery (superficial branch of transverse cervical artery) and\nthe dorsal scapular artery (deep branch of transverse cervical artery). These\nbranches run superficially and laterally across the phrenic nerve and anterior\nscalene muscle, 2\u20133 cm superior to the clavicle. They then cross or pass through\nthe trunks of the brachial plexus, supplying branches to their vasa nervorum\n(blood vessels of nerves). The superficial cervical artery passes deep (anterior)\nto the trapezius accompanying the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI). The dorsal\nscapular artery may arise independently, directly from the third (or, less often,\nthe second) part of the subclavian artery. When it is a branch of the subclavian,\nthe dorsal scapular artery passes laterally through the trunks of the brachial\nplexus, anterior to the middle scalene. Regardless of its origin, its distal portion\nruns deep to the levator scapulae and rhomboid muscles, supplying both and\nparticipating in the arterial anastomoses around the scapula (Chapter 3, Upper\nLimb). The occipital artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, enters the\nlateral cervical region at its apex and ascends over the head to supply the\nposterior half of the scalp (Fig. 9.10).\nThe subclavian artery supplies blood to the upper limb. The third part\nbegins approximately a finger\u2019s breadth superior to the clavicle, opposite the\nlateral border of the anterior scalene muscle. It is hidden in the inferior part of\nthe lateral cervical region, posterosuperior to the subclavian vein. The third part\nof the artery is the longest and most superficial part. It lies on the 1st rib, and its\npulsations can be felt by applying deep pressure in the omoclavicular triangle.\nThe artery is in contact with the 1st rib as it passes posterior to the anterior\nscalene muscle; consequently, compression of the subclavian artery against this\nrib can control bleeding in the upper limb. The inferior trunk of the brachial\nplexus lies directly posterior to the third part of the artery. The branches that\noccasionally arise from the third part (suprascapular artery, dorsal scapular\nartery) are aberrant forms of more typical patterns in which they arise elsewhere\n(from the thyrocervical trunk via a cervicodorsal trunk).\n2242"

The nerve passes postero-inferiorly, within or deep to the investing layer\nof deep cervical fascia, running on the levator scapulae from which it is\nseparated by the prevertebral layer of fascia.

A fibrous sling derived from the pretracheal layer of\ndeep cervical fascia allows the tendon to slide anteriorly and posteriorly as it\nconnects this tendon to the body and greater horn of the hyoid.\nThe difference in nerve supply between the anterior and the posterior bellies\nof the digastric muscles results from their different embryological origin from\nthe 1st and 2nd pharyngeal arches, respectively. CN V supplies derivatives of the\n1st arch, and CN VII supplies those of the 2nd arch.\nThe infrahyoid muscles, often called strap muscles because of their ribbon-\nlike appearance, are inferior to the hyoid (Figs. 9.16 and 9.19; Table 9.3). These\nfour muscles anchor the hyoid, sternum, clavicle, and scapula and depress the\nhyoid and larynx during swallowing and speaking. They also work with the\nsuprahyoid muscles to steady the hyoid, providing a firm base for the tongue.\nThe infrahyoid group of muscles are arranged in two planes: a superficial plane,\nmade up of the sternohyoid and omohyoid, and a deep plane, composed of the\nsternothyroid and thyrohyoid.\nLike the digastric, the omohyoid has two bellies (superior and inferior)\nunited by an intermediate tendon.

The proximal part of each internal\ncarotid artery is the site of the carotid sinus (Figs. 9.18 and 9.20). The carotid\nbody is located in the cleft between the internal and the external carotid arteries.\nThe internal carotid arteries enter the cranium through the carotid canals in the\npetrous parts of the temporal bones and become the main arteries of the brain\nand structures in the orbits (see Chapter 8, Head). No named branches arise from\nthe internal carotid arteries in the neck.\nThe external carotid arteries supply most structures external to the\ncranium; the orbit and the part of the forehead and scalp supplied by the supra-\norbital artery are the major exceptions. There is some deep distribution as well\n(e.g., via the middle meningeal artery). Each external carotid artery runs\nposterosuperiorly to the region between the neck of the mandible and the lobule\nof the auricle, where it is embedded in the parotid gland, and terminates by\ndividing into two branches, the maxillary artery and the superficial temporal\nartery (Fig. 9.20).

The inferior end of the IJV dilates to form the\ninferior bulb of the IJV. This bulb has a bicuspid valve that permits blood to\nflow toward the heart while preventing backflow into the vein, as might occur if\ninverted (e.g., standing on one\u2019s head or when intrathoracic pressure is\nincreased).\nThe tributaries of the IJV are the inferior petrosal sinus and the facial and\nlingual (often by a common trunk), pharyngeal, and superior and middle thyroid\nveins. The occipital vein usually drains into the suboccipital venous plexus,\ndrained by the deep cervical vein and the vertebral vein, but it may drain into the\nIJV.\nThe inferior petrosal sinus leaves the cranium through the jugular foramen\nand enters the superior bulb of the IJV. The facial vein empties into the IJV\nopposite or just inferior to the level of the hyoid. The facial vein may receive the\nsuperior thyroid, lingual, or sublingual veins. The lingual veins form a single\nvein from the tongue, which empties into the IJV at the level of origin of the\nlingual artery.

It can be entered\nhere by a needle or catheter (see \u201cInternal Jugular Vein Puncture\u201d).\nThe EJV runs vertically across the SCM toward the angle of the mandible\n(Fig. 9.23D). It may be prominent, especially if distended by asking the person\nto take a deep breath and hold it, expiring against resistance (Valsalva maneuver)\nor by using gentle pressure on the inferior part of the vein. These actions impede\nvenous return to the right side of the heart. The EJV is less obvious in children\nand middle-aged women because their subcutaneous tissues tend to be thicker\nthan those in men.\nThe great auricular nerve parallels the EJV, approximately a finger\u2019s breadth\nposterior to the vein.

The most common type of torticollis (wry neck) results from a fibrous\ntissue tumor (L. fibromatosis colli) that develops in the SCM before or shortly\nafter birth. The lesion, like a normal unilateral SCM contraction, causes the\nhead to tilt toward, and the face to turn away from, the affected side (Fig. B9.1).\nWhen torticollis occurs prenatally, the abnormal position of the infant\u2019s head\nusually necessitates a breech delivery.\n2266"

Symptoms resulting from this obstruction depend on the\ndegree of obstruction and the amount of collateral blood flow to the brain and\nstructures in the orbit from other arteries. A partial occlusion of the internal\ncarotid may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a sudden focal loss of\nneurological function (e.g., dizziness and disorientation) that disappears within\n24 hours. Arterial occlusion may also cause a minor stroke, a loss of\nneurological function such as weakness or sensory loss on one side of the body\nthat exceeds 24 hours but disappears within 3 weeks.\nObstruction of blood flow can be observed in a Doppler color study (Fig.\nB9.3A). A Doppler is a diagnostic instrument that emits an ultrasonic beam and\ndetects its reflection from moving fluid (blood) in a manner that distinguishes\nthe fluid from the static surrounding tissue, providing information about its\npressure, velocity, and turbulence. Carotid occlusion, causing stenosis\n(narrowing) in otherwise healthy persons (Fig. B9.3B), can be relieved by\nopening the artery at its origin and stripping off the atherosclerotic plaque with\nthe intima. This procedure is called carotid endarterectomy. After the operation,\ndrugs that inhibit clot formation are administered until the endothelium has\nregrown. Because of the relations of the internal carotid artery, there is risk of\ncranial nerve injury during the procedure involving one or more of the\nfollowing nerves: CN IX, CN X (or its branch, the superior laryngeal nerve),\nCN XI, or CN XII (Fig. 9.22).\n2273"

The brachiocephalic trunk usually has no preterminal\nbranches.\nThe subclavian arteries supply the upper limbs; they also send branches to\nthe neck and brain (Figs. 9.20 and 9.25). The right subclavian artery arises\nfrom the brachiocephalic trunk. The left subclavian artery arises from the arch\nof the aorta, about 1 cm distal to the left common carotid artery. The left vagus\nnerve runs parallel to the first part of the artery (Fig. 9.25A). Although the\nsubclavian arteries of the two sides have different origins, their courses in the\nneck begin posterior to the respective SC joints as they ascend through the\nsuperior thoracic aperture and enter the root of the neck.\nThe subclavian arteries arch superolaterally, reaching an apex as they pass\nposterior to the anterior scalene muscles. As they begin to descend, they lie\nposterior to the middle of the clavicles. As the subclavian arteries cross the outer\nmargin of the first ribs, their name changes; they become the axillary arteries.\nThree parts of each subclavian artery are described relative to the anterior\nscalene: the first part is medial to the muscle, the second part is posterior to it,\nand the third part is lateral to it (Figs. 9.12 and 9.25B).

At the apex of this\nspace, the artery passes deeply to course through the foramina transversaria of\nvertebrae C1\u2013C6. This is the vertebral part of the vertebral artery.\nOccasionally, the vertebral artery may enter a foramen more superior than\nvertebra C6. In approximately 5% of people, the left vertebral artery arises from\nthe arch of the aorta.\nThe suboccipital part of the vertebral artery courses in a groove on the\nposterior arch of the atlas before it enters the cranial cavity through the foramen\nmagnum. The cranial part of the vertebral artery supplies branches to the\nmedulla and spinal cord, parts of the cerebellum, and the dura of the posterior\ncranial fossa. At the inferior border of the pons of the brainstem, the vertebral\narteries join to form the basilar artery, which participates in the formation of the\ncerebral arterial circle (see Chapter 8, Head).\nThe internal thoracic artery arises from the antero-inferior aspect of the\nsubclavian artery and passes inferomedially into the thorax. The cervical part of\nthe internal thoracic artery has no branches; its thoracic distribution is described\nin Chapter 4, Thorax (Figs. 4.14 and 4.15A).\nThe thyrocervical trunk arises from the anterosuperior aspect of the first\npart of the subclavian artery, near the medial border of the anterior scalene\nmuscle. It has four branches, the largest and most important of which is the\ninferior thyroid artery, the primary visceral artery of the neck, supplying the\nlarynx, trachea, esophagus, and thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as\nadjacent muscles.

The trunk passes\nposterosuperiorly and divides into the superior intercostal and deep cervical\narteries, which supply the first two intercostal spaces and the posterior deep\ncervical muscles, respectively.\nVEINS IN ROOT OF NECK\nTwo large veins terminating in the root of the neck are the EJV, draining blood\nreceived mostly from the scalp and face, and the variable anterior jugular vein\n(AJV), usually the smallest of the jugular veins (Figs. 9.16 and 9.21). The AJV\ntypically arises near the hyoid from the confluence of superficial submandibular\nveins. The AJV descends either in the subcutaneous tissue or deep to the\ninvesting layer of deep cervical fascia between the anterior median line and the\nanterior border of the SCM. At the root of the neck, the AJV turns laterally,\nposterior to the SCM, and opens into the termination of the EJV or into the\nsubclavian vein. Superior to the manubrium, the right and left AJVs commonly\nunite across the midline to form the jugular venous arch in the suprasternal\nspace (Fig. 9.17).\nThe subclavian vein, the continuation of the axillary vein, begins at the\nlateral border of the 1st rib and ends when it unites with the IJV (Fig. 9.25A).\nThe subclavian vein passes over the 1st rib anterior to the scalene tubercle\nparallel to the subclavian artery, but it is separated from it by the anterior scalene\nmuscle. It usually has only one named tributary, the EJV (Fig. 9.21).\nThe IJV ends posterior to the medial end of the clavicle by uniting with the\nsubclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. This union is commonly\nreferred to as the venous angle and is the site where the thoracic duct (left side)\nand the right lymphatic trunk (right side) drain lymph collected throughout the\nbody into the venous circulation (see Fig. 9.49).

The phrenic nerves descend anterior to the\nanterior scalene muscles under cover of the IJVs and the SCMs. They pass under\nthe prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia, between the subclavian arteries and\nveins, and proceed to the thorax to supply the diaphragm. The phrenic nerves are\nimportant because, in addition to their sensory distribution, they provide the sole\nmotor supply to their own half of the diaphragm (see Chapter 4, Thorax, for\ndetails).\nSympathetic Trunks. The cervical portion of the sympathetic trunks lie\nanterolateral to the vertebral column, extending superiorly to the level of the C1\nvertebra or cranial base (Figs. 9.25B and 9.26). The sympathetic trunks receive\nno white rami communicantes in the neck (recall that white rami are only\nassociated with spinal nerves T1\u2013L2 or 3).

Each cartilage has an apex superiorly, a vocal process\nanteriorly, and a large muscular process that projects laterally from its base. The\napex bears the corniculate cartilage and attaches to the aryepiglottic fold. The\nvocal process provides the posterior attachment for the vocal ligament, and the\nmuscular process serves as a lever to which the posterior and lateral crico-\narytenoid muscles are attached. The crico-arytenoid joints, located between the\nbases of the arytenoid cartilages and the superolateral surfaces of the lamina of\nthe cricoid cartilage (Fig. 9.33B, E), permit the arytenoid cartilages to slide\ntoward or away from one to another, to tilt anteriorly and posteriorly, and to\nrotate. These movements are important in approximating, tensing, and relaxing\nthe vocal folds.\nThe elastic vocal ligaments extend from the junction of the laminae of the\nthyroid cartilage anteriorly to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage\nposteriorly (Fig. 9.33E).

Contraction of the lateral crico-\narytenoids, transverse and oblique arytenoids, and aryepiglottic muscles\nbrings the aryepiglottic folds together and pulls the arytenoid cartilages\ntoward the epiglottis.

(Part\nB, Courtesy of Dr. W. Kucharczyk, University Health Network,\nToronto, Ontario, Canada.)\nIn adults, the trachea is approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, whereas in\ninfants, it has the diameter of a pencil. The trachea extends from the inferior end\nof the larynx at the level of the C6 vertebra. It ends at the level of the sternal\nangle or the T4\u2013T5 IV disc, where it divides into the right and left main bronchi\n(see Chapter 4, Thorax).\nLateral to the trachea are the common carotid arteries and the lobes of the\nthyroid gland (Fig. 9.40). Inferior to the isthmus of the thyroid gland are the\njugular venous arch and the inferior thyroid veins (Figs. 9.17 and 9.29). The\nbrachiocephalic trunk is related to the right side of the trachea in the root of the\nneck. Deviation of the trachea from the midline, apparent superficially or\nradiographically, often signals the presence of a pathological process. Tracheal\ntrauma often affects the closely adherent esophagus.\nAlimentary Layer of Cervical Viscera\nIn the alimentary layer, cervical viscera take part in the digestive functions of the\nbody. Although the pharynx conducts air to the larynx, trachea, and lungs, the\npharyngeal constrictors direct (and the epiglottis deflects) food to the esophagus.\nThe esophagus, also involved in food propulsion, is the beginning of the\nalimentary canal (digestive tract).\nPHARYNX\nThe pharynx is the superior expanded part of the alimentary system posterior to\nthe nasal and oral cavities, extending inferiorly past the larynx (Figs. 9.42, 9.43\nand 9.44A).

It\nbegins in the neck where it is continuous with the laryngopharynx at the\npharyngo-esophageal junction (Figs. 9.43 and 9.47B). The esophagus consists\nof striated (voluntary) muscle in its upper third, smooth (involuntary) muscle in\nits lower third, and a mixture of striated and smooth muscle in between.\nIts first part, the cervical esophagus, is part of the voluntary upper third. It\nbegins immediately posterior to, and at the level of, the inferior border of the\ncricoid cartilage in the median plane. This is the level of the C6 vertebra.\nExternally, the pharyngo-esophageal junction appears as a constriction\nproduced by the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor\nmuscle (the superior esophageal sphincter) and is the narrowest part of the\nesophagus. The cervical esophagus inclines slightly to the left as it descends and\nenters the superior mediastinum via the superior thoracic aperture, where it\nbecomes the thoracic esophagus.\nWhen the esophagus is empty, it is a slit-like lumen. When a food bolus\ndescends in it, the lumen expands, eliciting reflex peristalsis in the inferior two\nthirds of the esophagus. The cervical esophagus lies between the trachea and the\ncervical vertebral column (Figs. 9.42 and 9.44A). It is attached to the trachea by\nloose connective tissue. The recurrent laryngeal nerves lie in or near the\ntracheo-esophageal grooves between the trachea and esophagus (Fig. 9.47). On\nthe right of the esophagus is the right lobe of the thyroid gland and the right\ncarotid sheath and its contents.\nThe esophagus is in contact with the cervical pleura at the root of the neck.\nOn the left is the left lobe of the thyroid gland and the left carotid sheath. The\nthoracic duct adheres to the left side of the esophagus and lies between the pleura\nand the esophagus. For details concerning the thoracic and abdominal regions of\nthe esophagus, see Chapter 4, Thorax, and Chapter 5, Abdomen.\nVessels of Cervical Esophagus. The arteries to the cervical esophagus are\nbranches of the inferior thyroid arteries. Each artery gives off ascending and\ndescending branches that anastomose with each other and across the midline.\n2330"

The voice is poor initially\nbecause the paralyzed vocal fold cannot adduct to meet the normal vocal fold.\nWithin weeks, the contralateral fold crosses the midline when its muscles act to\ncompensate. When bilateral paralysis of the vocal folds occurs, the voice is\nalmost absent because the vocal folds are motionless in a position that is slightly\nnarrower than the usually neutral respiratory position. They cannot be adducted\nfor phonation, nor can they be abducted for increased respiration, resulting in\nstridor (high-pitched, noisy respiration) often accompanied by anxiety similar\nto that accompanying an asthmatic episode.\nIn progressive lesions of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, abduction of the vocal\nligaments is lost before adduction; conversely, during recovery, adduction\nreturns before abduction. Hoarseness is the common symptom of serious\ndisorders of the larynx, such as carcinoma of the vocal folds.\nParalysis of the superior laryngeal nerve causes anesthesia of the superior\nlaryngeal mucosa. As a result, the protective mechanism designed to keep\nforeign bodies out of the larynx is inactive, and foreign bodies can easily enter\nthe larynx. Injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve results\nin a voice that is monotonous in character because the paralyzed cricothyroid\nmuscle supplied by it is unable to vary the length and tension of the vocal fold\n(Table 9.5).

The chief complaint of most\npeople with anosmia is the loss or alteration of taste; however, clinical studies\nreveal that in all but a few people, the dysfunction is in the olfactory system\n(Simpson, 2013). The reason is that most people confuse taste with flavor.\nTransitory olfactory impairment occurs as a result of viral or allergic rhinitis\u2014\ninflammation of the nasal mucous membrane.\nTo test the sense of smell, the person is blindfolded and asked to identify\ncommon odors, such as freshly ground coffee placed near the external nares\n(nostrils). One naris is occluded and the eyes are closed. Because anosmia is\nusually unilateral, each naris is tested separately. If the loss of smell is\nunilateral, the person may not be aware of it without clinical testing.\nInjury to the nasal mucosa, olfactory nerve fibers, olfactory bulbs, or\nolfactory tracts may also impair smell. In severe head injuries, the olfactory\nbulbs may be torn away from the olfactory nerves, or some olfactory nerve\nfibers may be torn as they pass through a fractured cribriform plate. If all the\nnerve bundles on one side are torn, a complete loss of smell will occur on that\nside; consequently, anosmia may be a clue to a fracture of the cranial base and\ncerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (leakage of the fluid through the nose).\nA tumor and/or abscess in the frontal lobe of the brain or a tumor of the\nmeninges (meningioma) in the anterior cranial fossa may also cause anosmia by\ncompressing the olfactory bulb and/or tract (D\u2019Amico et al., 2016).\n Olfactory Hallucinations\nOccasionally olfactory hallucinations (false perceptions of smell) may\naccompany lesions in the temporal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere.

Lesions of the trochlear nerve or its nucleus\ncause paralysis of the superior oblique and impair the ability to turn the affected\neyeball inferomedially. CN IV may be torn when there are severe head injuries\nbecause of its long intracranial course. The characteristic sign of trochlear nerve\ninjury is diplopia (double vision) when looking down. Diplopia occurs because\nthe superior oblique normally assists the inferior rectus in depressing the pupil\n(directing the gaze downward) and is the only muscle to do so when the pupil is\nadducted. In addition, because the superior oblique is the primary muscle\nproducing intorsion of the eyeball, the primary muscle producing extorsion (the\ninferior oblique) is unopposed when the superior oblique is paralyzed. Thus, the\ndirection of gaze and rotation of the eyeball about its anteroposterior axis is\ndifferent for the two eyes when an attempt is made to look downward and\nespecially when looking downward and medially. The person can compensate\nfor the diplopia by inclining the head anteriorly and laterally toward the side of\nthe normal eye.\nTRIGEMINAL NERVE (CN V)\n2420"

It may be involved occasionally in poliomyelitis (\u201cpolio,\u201d\na viral infantile disease) and generalized polyneuropathy, a disease affecting\nseveral peripheral nerves. The sensory and motor nuclei in the pons and medulla\nmay be destroyed by intramedullary tumors or vascular lesions. An isolated\nlesion of the spinal trigeminal tract also may occur with multiple sclerosis (MS).\nInjury to CN V causes the following:\nParalysis of the muscles of mastication with deviation of the mandible\ntoward the side of the lesion (Table 10.6).\nLoss of the ability to appreciate soft tactile, thermal, or painful sensations in\nthe face.\nLoss of corneal reflex (blinking in response to the cornea being touched)\nand the sneezing reflex (stimulated by irritants to clear the respiratory tract).\nCommon causes of facial numbness are dental trauma, herpes zoster\nophthalmicus (infection caused by a herpes virus), cranial trauma, head and\nneck tumors, intracranial tumors, and idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy (a nerve\ndisease of unknown cause).\nTrigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), the principal disease affecting the\nsensory root of CN V, produces excruciating, episodic pain that is usually\nrestricted to the areas supplied by the maxillary and/or mandibular divisions of\nthis nerve. (See the clinical box \u201cTrigeminal Neuralgia\u201d in Chapter 8, Head, for\na detailed discussion.)\n Dental Anesthesia\nAnesthetic agents are commonly administered by injection to block pain during\ndental procedures. CN V is of great importance in the practice of dentistry\nbecause it is the sensory nerve of the head, serving the teeth and mucosa of the\noral cavity. Because the superior alveolar nerves (branches of CN V2) are not\naccessible, the maxillary teeth are locally anesthetized by injecting the agent\n2421"

This procedure\nis described in the clinical box \u201cInferior Alveolar Nerve Block\u201d in Chapter 8,\nHead.\n ABDUCENT NERVE (CN VI)\nBecause CN VI has a long intradural course, it is often stretched when\nintracranial pressure rises, partly because of the sharp bend it makes over the\ncrest of the petrous part of the temporal bone after entering the dura mater. A\nspace-occupying lesion, such as a brain tumor, may compress CN VI, causing\nparalysis of the lateral rectus. Complete paralysis of CN VI causes medial\ndeviation of the affected eye, that is, it is adducted by the unopposed action of\nthe medial rectus, leaving the person unable to abduct the eye lateral to the\nprimary position. Diplopia (double vision) is present in all ranges of movement\nof the eyeball, except on gazing to the side opposite the lesion. Paralysis of CN\nVI may also result from:\nAn aneurysm of the cerebral arterial circle (at the base of the brain).

Depending on the part of the nerve involved, injury to CN VII may\ncause paralysis of facial muscles without loss of taste on the anterior two thirds\nof the tongue or altered secretion of the lacrimal and salivary glands.\nA lesion of CN VII near its origin or near the geniculate ganglion is\naccompanied by loss of motor, gustatory (taste), and autonomic functions. The\nmotor paralysis of facial muscles involves superior and inferior parts of the face\non the ipsilateral side.\nA central lesion of CN VII (lesion of the CNS) results in paralysis of\nmuscles in the inferior face on the contralateral side. Consequently, forehead\nwrinkling is not visibly impaired because it is innervated bilaterally. Lesions\nbetween the geniculate ganglion and the origin of the chorda tympani produce\nthe same effects as that resulting from injury near the ganglion, except that\nlacrimal secretion is not affected. Because it passes through the facial canal in\nthe temporal bone, CN VII is vulnerable to compression when a viral infection\nproduces inflammation (viral neuritis) and swelling of the nerve just before it\nemerges from the stylomastoid foramen.\nBecause the branches of CN VII are superficial, they are subject to injury\nfrom knife and gunshot wounds, cuts, and birth injury. Damage to CN VII is\ncommon with fracture of the temporal bone and is usually detectable\nimmediately after the injury. CN VII may also be affected by tumors of the\nbrain and cranium, aneurysms, meningeal infections, and herpes viruses.\nAlthough injuries to CN VII cause paralysis of facial muscles, sensory loss in\nthe small area of skin on the posteromedial surface of the auricle of the ear and\naround the opening of the external acoustic meatus is rare. Similarly, hearing is\nnot usually impaired, but the ear may become more sensitive to low tones when\nthe stapedius (supplied by CN VII) is paralyzed; this muscle dampens vibration\nof the stapes (see Chapter 8, Head).\nBell palsy is a unilateral facial paralysis of sudden onset resulting from a\nlesion of CN VII.

Hence, lesions of CN VIII may cause tinnitus (ringing or\nbuzzing in ears), vertigo (dizziness, loss of balance), and impairment or loss of\nhearing. Central lesions may involve either the cochlear or vestibular divisions\nof CN VIII.\n Deafness\nThere are two kinds of deafness (hearing loss): conductive deafness, involving\nthe external or middle ear (e.g., otitis media, inflammation in the middle ear; see\nthe clinical box, \u201cOtitis Media\u201d in Chapter 8, Head, for an illustrated and\ndetailed discussion), and sensorineural deafness (damage to the hair cells in the\ninner ear), which results from disease in the cochlea or in the pathway from the\ncochlea to the brain.\n Acoustic Neuroma\nAn acoustic neuroma (neurofibroma) is a slow-growing benign tumor of the\nneurolemma (Schwann) cells. The tumor begins in the vestibular nerve while it\nis in the internal acoustic meatus. The early symptom of an acoustic neuroma is\nusually loss of hearing. Dysequilibrium (derangement of the sense of motion\nand balance) and tinnitus occur in approximately 70% of patients (D\u2019Amico et\nal., 2016).\n Trauma and Vertigo\nPeople with head trauma often experience headache, dizziness, vertigo, and\nother features of posttraumatic injury. Vertigo is a hallucination of movement\ninvolving the person or the environment (Roberts, 2016). It often involves a\nspinning sensation, but it may be felt as a swaying back and forth or falling.\nThese symptoms, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, are usually\nrelated to a peripheral vestibular nerve lesion.\n2424"

Ipsilateral weakness may produce a\nnoticeable change in swallowing.\nInjuries of CN IX resulting from infection or tumors are usually accompanied\nby signs of involvement of adjacent nerves. Because CN IX, CN X, and CN XI\npass through the jugular foramen, tumors in this region produce multiple cranial\nnerve palsies, called the jugular foramen (Vernet) syndrome, in which\ndysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) and dysarthria (motor difficulty in\nspeaking) are more apparent.

Injury of the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve causes dysphonia (hoarseness or weakness of voice) because of\nparalysis of the vocal folds (cords). Paralysis of both recurrent laryngeal nerves\ncauses aphonia (loss of voice) and inspiratory stridor (a harsh, high-pitched\nrespiratory sound). Paralysis of recurrent laryngeal nerves usually results from\ncancer of the larynx and thyroid gland and/or from injury during surgery on the\nthyroid gland, neck, esophagus, heart, and lungs.
