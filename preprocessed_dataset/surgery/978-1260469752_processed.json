Command and control is a colloquial term for the \npreviously predominant style of leadership in surgery based \non fear and intimidation. Time management and mentorship \nare key leadership skills. Coaching, pacesetting, and demo -\ncratic are leadership styles. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 4.)\n 2. A senior resident and attending are performing a laparo -\nscopic cholecystectomy. The resident initially performs \nthe majority of the case following instruction from the \nattending. However, the resident informs the attending \nthat he feels uncertain whether he has truly obtained the \ncritical view of safety. With the attending\u2019s assistance, \nthe case was successfully completed. After the case, the \nresident then asks the attending for a debrief of the case. \nWhich fundamental principle of leadership is being \ndemonstrated by the resident?\nA. Conflict resolution\nB. Vision\nC. Effective communication\nD. Willingness to lead 1. The fundamental principles of leadership are:\nA. Vision and willingness\nB. Command and control\nC. Time management and mentoring\nD. Coaching, pacesetting, and democratic\nAnswer: C\nLeadership is a complex concept. Surgeons should strive to \nadopt leadership qualities that provide the best outcomes for \ntheir patients based on the following fundamental principles: \nvision, willingness, time management, conflict resolution, \nrecruitment, and culture (see Table 1-1).

Should seek a solution that benefits all involved and \nthat is based upon core values of the organization.\nC. Traditional command and control based on fear and \nintimidation can lead to sanctions and lawsuits.\nD. Conflict resolution is more successful when both \nsides can admit they share some fault.Answer: D\nModern conflict resolution techniques are based upon objec -\ntivity, willingness to listen, and pursuit of principle-based \nsolutions. For example, an effective style of conflict resolution \nis the utilization of the \u201cabundance mentality\u201d model, which \nattempts to achieve a solution that benefits all involved and is \nbased upon core values of the organization, as opposed to the \nutilization of the traditional fault-finding model, which iden -\ntifies sides as right or wrong. Application of the abundance \nmentality in surgery elevates the conflict above the affected \nparties and focuses on the higher unifying goal of improved \npatient care. Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences \nare managed in this style and have the purpose of practice \nimprovement and improving overall quality of care within \nthe system, as opposed to placing guilt or blame on the sur -\ngeon or surgical trainees for the complication being reviewed. \nThe traditional style of the command-and-control technique \nbased on fear and intimidation is no longer welcome in \nany health care system and can lead to sanctions, lawsuits, \nand removal of hospital privileges or position of leadership. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 9.)\n 5.

The coercive style of leadership is antiquated and is \nno longer effective in surgery.\nB. Democratic leadership is useful for building team \nconsensus and minimizing conflict but may frustrate \nteam members if there is no clear, unifying vision.\nC. The pacesetter leads by example and sets high stan -\ndards for his team but typically takes over the tasks \nof something falling behind instead of building \nthem up.\nD. The authoritative leader is often the most effective \nand focuses on directing the team toward a common \nvision allowing team members room for innovation \nand experimentation, and supporting their efforts.Answer: A\nThe coercive  leader demands immediate compliance. This \nstyle reflects the command-and-control style that has histori -\ncally dominated surgery. Excessive coercive leadership erodes \nteam members\u2019 sense of responsibility, motivation, sense of \nparticipation in a shared vision, and ultimately, performance. \nThe phrase \u201cDo what I tell you!\u201d brings to mind the coercive \nleader. However, it is effective in times of crisis to deliver clear, \nconcise instruction. This style should be used sparingly and \nis best suited for emergencies. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 12.) 3. Effective communication is a key component of leader -\nship, given that miscommunication is a leading cause \nof medical errors. Which of the following statements is \nFALSE regarding communication?\nA. To Err Is Human , a publication by the US Institute \nof Medicine, identified medical errors as the eighth \nleading cause of death in the United States, causing \n100,000 deaths annually.\nB. Effective communication that ensures all team mem -\nbers understand daily goals of care for an ICU patient \ncan significantly decrease their length of stay in the \nICU.\nC. Communication errors are often simply due to negli -\ngence and failure to transmit information.\nD. Information transfer and communication errors \ncause delays in patient care and can cause serious \nadverse events.\nE. Improved communication in the OR among cardiac \nsurgery patients is associated with decreased adverse \noutcomes.Answer: C\nCommunication errors are often caused by miscommunica -\ntion due to hierarchical differences, concerns with upward \ninfluence, conflicting roles and role ambiguity, and interper -\nsonal conflict.

Which \nof the following is considered the gold standard for the \ntraining and assessment of clinical and nontechnical \nskills with high reliability and validity?\nA. Command-and-control leadership\nB. Simulation training\nC. Coworker observation reporting system\nD. Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)Answer: D\nThe past decade has seen a demonstrable increase in our \nknowledge of how to develop leadership skills, particularly \nthrough simulation, as well as leadership evaluation through \nOSCE and other tools. Multiple groups have assessed multi -\ndisciplinary teams, typically composed of nurses, anesthesia \ngroups, and surgeons for the leadership-associated nontech -\nnical skills of communication, teamwork, and situational \nawareness. Through increasingly validated instruments \nand assessment tools, these nontechnical skills have been \nfound to be trainable. The OSCE has been established as the \ngold standard for the training and assessment of a wide range \nof clinical and nontechnical skills with high reliability and \nvalidity.

Diversity programs improve recruitment of women \nand underrepresented minority residents and faculty.\nC. Diversity helps address disparities in social determi -\nnants of health.\nD. B and C.Answer: D\nThe past quarter century has seen a steady increase in diver -\nsity within the field of surgery. Women, as of 2015, repre -\nsent 38% of surgical trainees and 10% of academic professors \ncurrently, but have doubled their representation in the past \n20 years. Some fields, such as head and neck surgery and \nplastic surgery, have studied their own subspecialty groups \nwith similar findings. African Americans comprise both 6% \nof medical school graduates, 6% of surgical trainees, and \n2% to 4% of professors of surgery nationwide. Hispanics \nrepresent 5% of graduating medical students, 9% of general \nsurgery trainees, and 4% to 5% of persons at all levels of \nacademic surgery. Physician diversity is crucial and may \nhelp to address disparities in social determinants of health. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 12.)\n 9.

Community outreach\nB. \u201cPipeline\u201d\nC. Physician teacher\nD. BottleneckAnswer: B\nStudies indicate that the bottleneck in diversity occurs at the \nlevel of the medical school application pool, which in turn is \ncaused by educational deficiencies at the primary, secondary, \nand collegiate levels. As an attempted solution, the University \nof Michigan developed a \u201cpipeline\u201d program that pairs grade-\nschool and high-school students with physicians for experien -\ntial learning and the development of mentoring, presentation \nskills, and networking. It is important for departments of sur -\ngery to develop a diversity program for recruitment of resi -\ndents and faculty.

CRP belongs to the pentraxin \ngroup of molecules. CRP is low in normal circumstances, but \nis synthesized in the liver in response to IL-6 with serum levels \nincreasing 1000-fold. In this way, CRP is a marker of acute \ninflammation. CRP levels do not vary with circadian rhythms \nor with caloric intake. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 2, p. 34.)\n 2. Which of the following is TRUE regarding the inflam -\nmatory response following traumatic injury?\nA. There is an acute proinflammatory response caused \nby stimulation of the adaptive immune system.\nB. There is an anti-inflammatory response that leads to \na return to homeostasis accompanied suppression of \nthe innate immune system.\nC. An acute proinflammatory response secondary to \nactivate of innate immunity, an anti-inflammatory \nresponse, and suppression of adaptive immunity \noccur currently following injury.\nD. Systemic inflammation following trauma is related to \nthe immune response to microbes.Answer: C\nTraumatic injury rapidly induces multiple responses from \nthe immune system. There is (1) an acute proinflammatory \nresponse that is triggered by activation of the innate immune \nsystem via DAMPs, (2) an anti-inflammatory response that \nlikely serves to modulate the pro-inflammatory response and \nreturn the host toward homeostasis, and (3) suppression of \ncellular-mediated adaptive immunity. Recent studies indicate \nthat these three responses occur concurrently immediately \nfollowing injury. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 2, p. 28.) 1. C-reactive protein (CRP):\nA.

DAMPs function early in the immune response to \ntrauma by activating adaptive immunity.\nB. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) \nand DAMPs have different signaling characteristics \nand do not bind the same types of receptors.\nC. DAMPs are ligands for a group of receptors broadly \nterm pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which \nincludes toll-like receptors (TLRs).\nD. DAMPs signal only to immune cells.Answer: C\nDAMPs are endogenous molecules that are produced dur -\ning tissue damage or cellular stress. These molecules interact \nwith both immune and nonimmune cells and function to \nactivate the adaptive immune response early following injury. \nDAMPs are similar to PAMPs in both types of receptors they \nbind and their role in signaling during the immune response. \nBoth DAMPs and PAMPs signal via PRRs, which includes \nreceptors such as TLRs, RAGE, calcium-dependent recep -\ntors (CLRs), and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich \nrepeat-containing proteins (NLRs).

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) induces production \nof HMGB1.\nB. mtDNA and peptides from damaged mitochondria \nactivate the macrophage inflammasome and the \nstimulator of interferon gene pathway (STING).\nC. mtDNA and peptides modulate the anti-inflamma -\ntory response that suppresses the adaptive immune \nsystem.\nD. mtDNA is directly toxic to the liver and lung in high \namounts.Answer: B\nCell-free mtDNA has been shown to be significantly higher \nin the circulation of trauma patients than in normal controls. \nMitochondrial proteins and/or DNA can act as DAMPs by \ntriggering an inflammatory response to necrosis and cel -\nlular stress. Specifically, the release of mtDNA and formyl \npeptides from damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria has \nbeen implicated in activation of the macrophage inflamma -\nsome, a cytosolic signaling complex that responds to cellu -\nlar stress. mtDNA also activates the STING. With stress or  \ntissue injury, mtDNA and peptides are released from damaged \nmitochondria where they can contribute to a sterile inflam -\nmatory response. From an evolutionary perspective, given \nthat eukaryotic mitochondria derive from bacterial origin, it \nwould make sense that they retain bacterial features capable \nof eliciting a strong response that is typically associated with a \npathogen trigger. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 2, p. 30.)\n 7. Which of the following statements is FALSE regard -\ning the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and \ninjury-associated stress?\nA. The HPA axis is initiated by the hypothalamus-\nproducing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) \nreleased from the paraventricular nucleus in response \nto inflammatory cytokines.\nB. CRH acts on the anterior pituitary to stimulate adre -\nnocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion into \nsystemic circulation.\nC. CRH simulates the zona fasciculata of the adrenal \ngland to synthesize and secrete glucocorticoids.\nD. Insufficient cortisol in response to critical illness can \nlead to tachycardia, hypotension, weakness, hypogly -\ncemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.Answer: C\nThe HPA axis is one of the main mechanism by which the brain \nresponds to injury. CRH is released from the paraventricular \nnucleus in response to inflammatory cytokines. CRH acts on \nthe anterior pituitary to stimulate the secretion of ACTH into \nthe systemic circulation. ACTH acts on the zona fasciculata \nof the adrenal glands to synthesize and secrete glucocor -\nticoids . Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid in humans and \nis essential for survival during significant physiologic stress. \nThe resulting increase in cortisol levels following trauma has \nseveral important anti-inflammatory actions. Adrenal insuf -\nficiency represents a clinical syndrome highlighted largely \nby inadequate amounts of circulating cortisol and aldoste -\nrone. Classically, adrenal insufficiency is described in patients \nwith atrophic adrenal glands caused by exogenous steroid  4. High-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1):\nA. Is one of the best-characterized damage-associated \nmolecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, detectable in \nthe circulation within 30 minutes of trauma.\nB. Is a protein secreted by immune-competent cells \nstimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns \n(PAMPs) or inflammatory cytokines.\nC. Is also secreted by endothelial cells, platelets, and also \nas a part of cell death.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nThe best-characterized DAMP in the context of the injury-\nassociated inflammatory response is high-mobility group \nprotein B1 (HMGB1), which is rapidly released into the circu -\nlation within 30 minutes following trauma. Subsequent studies \nhave proven, however, that HMGB1 is actively secreted from \nimmune-competent cells stimulated by PAMPs (eg, endotoxin) \nor by inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor and \ninterleukin-1). Stressed nonimmune cells, such as endothelial \ncells, and platelet also actively secrete HMGB1. Finally, passive \nrelease of HMGB1 can occur following cell death, whether it \nis programmed or uncontrolled (necrosis). The diverse pro -\ninflammatory biological responses that result from HMGB1 \nsignaling include: (1) the release of cytokines and chemokines \nfrom macrophage/monocytes and dendritic cells; (2) neu -\ntrophil activation and chemotaxis; (3) alterations in epithe -\nlial barrier function, including increased permeability; and \n(4) increased procoagulant activity on platelet surfaces; among \nothers.

It is pro -\nduced primarily by CD4+ T cells, but to a lesser degree by \nCD8+ T cells, NK T, mast, and activated dendritic cells. IL-2 \npromotes the cytolytic activity of CD8+ T and natural killer \ncells, and also promotes na\u00efve CD4+ T cell differentiation \ninto Th1 and Th2 phenotypes.

Anti-inflammatory mediator that is secreted from a \nvariety of immune cells and acts to inhibit secretion \nof proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1.\nC. Proinflammatory mediator that is secreted from a \nvariety of immune cells, promotes B cell maturation, \ninduces Th17 development and inhibits Treg differ -\nentiation, promotes angiogenesis, and increases vas -\ncular permeability.\nD. Proinflammatory mediator that is secreted primarily \nby macrophages and monocytes, and acts as a che -\nmoattractant for neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, \nand lymphocytes.Answer: B\nIL-10 plays an important role in the immune response in \nthat it acts in an anti-inflammatory role in order to rees -\ntablish immune homeostasis. It regulates the duration and \nmagnitude of the inflammatory response. IL-10 is secreted \nby both myeloid and lymphoid immune cells, and its syn -\nthesis is upregulated during stress and inflammation.

Changes in gene expression occur rapidly and are \ntransient, present for only 1 to 2 days.\nD. Patterns of gene expression varied widely when \nblunt trauma, burn injury, and endotoxemia were \ncompared.Answer: A\nRecent studies examining the transcriptomic response to blunt \ntrauma in circulating leukocytes from human patients dem -\nonstrated a significant shift in the leukocyte transcriptomic \nwith >80% of cellular functions and pathways demonstrating \nalterations. These pathways included those involved in innate \nand adaptive immunity, and compensatory anti-inflammatory \nmechanisms. Transcriptomic alterations occurred rapidly \n(4\u201312 hours) and persisted for days to weeks.

Which of the following statements about monocytes and \nmacrophages is FALSE?\nA. Monocytes and macrophages are the primary effector \ncells to respond to danger signals through phagocy -\ntosis, release of inflammatory mediators, and recruit -\nment of additional immune cells.\nB. Macrophages undergo M1 or M2 activation, with M1 \nmacrophages expressing high levels of proinflamma -\ntory cytokines.\nC. Monocytes and tissue macrophages are derived from \na common bone marrow progenitor.\nD. An imbalance of M1/M2 macrophage populations in \nthe lung contributes to acute lung injury following \nhemorrhagic shock.Answer: C\nMonocytes and macrophages are mononuclear cells that are \ncharacterized by their ability to phagocytize damage-associated \nmolecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molec -\nular patterns (PAMPs) and release inflammatory mediators \nto initiate the immune response to injury and inflamma -\ntion by recruiting additional immune cells to the site of \ninjury. Monocytes are derived from bone marrow progeni -\ntors, while tissue macrophages are derived from embryonic \nprecursors. In response to external cues (PAMPs, DAMPs, \nactivated lymphocytes), macrophages undergo M1 or M2 \nactivation. M1 macrophages are characterized by high levels \nof expression of proinflammatory cytokines and are able \nto recruit additional macrophages to the site of injury. M2 \nmacrophages are thought to promote a return to immune \nhomeostasis through expression of arginase-1 and IL-10, and \nare additionally involved in wound repair. Recent data has \nshown that an imbalance between these two phenotypes in \nthe lung contributes to acute lung injury after hemorrhagic \nshock due to a significant decrease in the M2 population \nand a delayed increase in the M1 population.

Macrophage\nB. CD8+ T cell\nC. Mast cell\nD. NeutrophilAnswer: D\nThe role of the platelet in the immune response has been \nrecently better defined. Platelets express TLRs and are able to \ndetect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and \ndamage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Platelet-  \nspecific TLR activation leads to platelets-binding and \n-activating neutrophils. Neutrophils then extrude their DNA \nto form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This facilitates \ntrapping of bacteria, but can also lead to endothelial cell dam -\nage. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 2, p. 56.)\nBrunicardi_Ch02_p007-012.indd   10 30/06/22   10:36 AM"

Lower cost of enteral feeding\nB. Lower risk of vascular access and infectious \ncomplications\nC. Fewer complications associated with gut disuse\nD. Improved immune response homeostasisAnswer: D\nEnteral nutrition (EN) is preferred to parenteral nutrition \n(PN) when feasible because of the lower cost of EN, lower risk \nof vascular access and infectious complications, and lower risk \nof gastrointestinal tract disuse complications. These compli -\ncations include diminished soluble IgA and cytokine produc -\ntion, bacterial overgrowth, altered mucosal barrier function, \nand immune defenses. There is no evidence of improved \nimmune homeostasis with the use of EN. Several studies have \nbeen performed, and a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a \nsignificant reduction in infectiously complications and length \nof ICU stay in critically ill patients receiving EN over PN. The \npositive impact of EN over PN may be more pronounced in \nmalnourished patients. Further, there is evidence that initiat -\ning EN early (within 48 hours) at 80% of the estimated total \nenergy goals provides benefit. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 2, \np. 68.)

Administration of antipsychotic medication.\nC. Transient decrease in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) \nsecretion.\nD. Excess oral water intake.Answer: C\nHyponatremia is caused by excess free water (dilution) or \ndecreased sodium (depletion). Thus, excessive intake of free \nwater (oral or IV) can lead to hyponatremia. Also, medica -\ntions can cause water retention and subsequent hypona -\ntremia, especially in older patients. Primary renal disease, \ndiuretic use, and secretion of ADH are common causes of \nsodium depletion. ADH can be released transiently post -\noperatively, or less frequently, in syndrome of inappropriate \nADH secretion. Lastly, pseudohyponatremia can be seen on \nlaboratory testing when high serum glucose, lipid, or protein \nlevels compromise sodium measurements. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 86.) 1. Metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap (AG) occurs \nwith:\nA. Diabetic acidosis.\nB. Renal failure.\nC. Severe diarrhea.\nD.

Serum ethanol\nD. Serum salicylateAnswer: A\nMetabolic acidosis results from an increased intake of acids, \nan increased generation of acids, or an increased loss of \nbicarbonate. In evaluating a patient with a low serum bicar -\nbonate level and metabolic acidosis, first measure the anion \ngap (AG), an index of unmeasured anions.\nAG = [Na] \u2013 [Cl + HCO3]\nMetabolic acidosis with an increased AG occurs from either \nexogenous acid ingestion (ethylene glycol, salicylate, or meth -\nanol) or endogenous acid production of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate \nand acetoacetate in ketoacidosis, lactate in lactic acidosis, or \norganic acids in renal insufficiency.

It should be avoided in closed head injury.\nC. It should not be used for initial resuscitation.\nD. It increases cerebral perfusion.Answer: B\nHypertonic saline (7.5%) has been used as a treatment modal -\nity in patients with closed head injuries. It has been shown  \nto increase cerebral perfusion and decrease intracranial pres -\nsure, thus decreasing brain edema. However, there also have \nbeen concerns of increased bleeding because hypertonic \nsaline is an arteriolar vasodilator. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \nCh. 3, p. 94.)\n 7. Normal saline is:\nA. 135 mEq NaCl/L.\nB. 145 mEq NaCl/L.\nC. 148 mEq NaCl/L.\nD. 154 mEq NaCl/L.Answer: D\nSodium chloride is mildly hypertonic, containing 154 mEq \nof sodium that is balanced by 154 mEq of chloride. The high \nchloride concentration imposes a significant chloride load \nupon the kidneys and may lead to a hyperchloremic meta -\nbolic acidosis.

Check the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.Answer: B\nMagnesium depletion is a common problem in hospitalized \npatients, particularly in the ICU. The kidney is primarily \nresponsible for magnesium homeostasis through regulation \nby calcium/magnesium receptors on renal tubular cells that \nsense serum magnesium levels. Hypomagnesemia results \nfrom a variety of etiologies ranging from poor intake (star -\nvation, alcoholism, prolonged use of IV fluids, and total \nparenteral nutrition with inadequate supplementation of mag -\nnesium), increased renal excretion (alcohol, most diuretics, \nand amphotericin B), gastrointestinal (GI) losses (diarrhea), \nmalabsorption, acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and \nprimary aldosteronism. Hypomagnesemia is important not \nonly for its direct effects on the nervous system, but also \nbecause it can produce hypocalcemia and lead to persistent \nhypokalemia.

Chronic diarrhea\nD. Renal tubular acidosisAnswer: D\nMetabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap (AG) results \neither from exogenous acid administration (HCl or NH4+), \nfrom loss of bicarbonate due to gastrointestinal (GI) disor -\nders such as diarrhea and fistulas or ureterosigmoidostomy, \nor from renal losses. In these settings, the bicarbonate loss \nis accompanied by a gain of chloride; thus, the AG remains \nunchanged. To determine if the loss of bicarbonate has a \nrenal cause, the urinary [NH4+] can be measured. A low uri -\nnary [NH4+] in the face of hyperchloremic acidosis would \nindicate that the kidney is the site of loss, and evaluation for \nrenal tubular acidosis should be undertaken. Proximal renal \ntubular acidosis results from decreased tubular reabsorption \nof HCO3\u2013, whereas distal renal tubular acidosis results from \ndecreased acid excretion. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor \nacetazolamide also causes bicarbonate loss from the kidneys. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 92.)\n 23.

Excreting carbon dioxide through the lungs.\nC. Excreting lactic acid through the kidneys.\nD. Metabolizing the lactic acid in the liver.Answer: B\nLactic acid reacts with base bicarbonate to produce carbonic \nacid. The carbonic acid is broken down into water and car -\nbon dioxide that is excreted by the lungs. Any diminution in \npulmonary function jeopardizes this reaction.

Hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic acidosis.\nC. Hypochloremic, hyperkalemic metabolic alkalosis.\nD. Hypochloremic, hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis.Answer: A\nHypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis can occur \nfrom isolated loss of gastric contents in infants with pyloric \nstenosis or in adults with duodenal ulcer disease. Unlike vom -\niting associated with an open pylorus, which involves a loss \nof gastric as well as pancreatic, biliary, and intestinal secre -\ntions, vomiting with an obstructed pylorus results only in the \nloss of gastric fluid, which is high in chloride and hydrogen, \nand therefore results in a hypochloremic alkalosis. Initially \nthe urinary bicarbonate level is high in compensation for \nthe alkalosis. Hydrogen ion reabsorption also ensues, with \nan accompanied potassium ion excretion. In response to \nthe associated volume deficit, aldosterone-mediated sodium \nreabsorption increases potassium excretion. The resulting \nhypokalemia leads to the excretion of hydrogen ions in the \nface of alkalosis, a paradoxic aciduria. Treatment includes \nreplacement of the volume deficit with isotonic saline and \nthen potassium replacement once adequate urine output is \nachieved. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 92.)\n 24.

Increase to the normal range without specific therapy.Answer: D\nA rise in the extracellular fluid concentration of a substance \nthat does not diffuse passively across cell membranes (eg, \nglucose or urea) causes an increase in effective osmotic pres -\nsure, a transfer of water from cells, and dilutional hyponatre -\nmia. For each 100 mg/dL rise in blood glucose above normal, \nthe serum sodium level falls approximately to 3 mEq/L. \nAlternatively, the serum sodium level would increase by \nabout 15 mEq/L if the blood glucose level falls from 600 to \n100 mg/dL.

Administration of furosemide.\nD. Administration of mithramycin.Answer: A\nPatients with acute hypercalcemia usually have either acute \nhyperparathyroidism or metastatic breast carcinoma with \nmultiple bony metastases. These patients develop severe \nheadaches, bone pain, thirst, emesis, and polyuria. Unless \ntreatment is instituted promptly, the symptoms may be \nrapidly fatal. Immediate correction of the associated defi -\ncit of extracellular fluid volume is the most important step \nin treatment. When effective, this results in the lowering of \nthe serum calcium level by dilution. Once extracellular fluid \nvolume has been replaced, furosemide is effective treat -\nment. Hemodialysis may also be employed, but its effect is \nless rapid. Mithramycin is very useful in controlling meta -\nstatic bone disease, but its effect is slow, and it cannot be \ndepended upon when the patient has acute hypercalcemia. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 95.) 28.

His arterial blood gases are pH, 7.25; P o2, \n95 mm Hg; P co2, 25 mm Hg; HCO3\u2013, 15 mEq/L. The \npatient\u2019s metabolic acidosis would be treated best with:\nA. Ampule of sodium bicarbonate.\nB. Sodium bicarbonate infusion.\nC. Lactated Ringer solution.\nD. Hyperventilation.Answer: C\nIn patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, the presence \nof a metabolic acidosis early in the postresuscitative period is \nindicative of tissue hypoxia due to persistent inadequate tis -\nsue perfusion. Attempts to correct this problem by admin -\nistering an alkalizing agent will not solve the basic problem. \nHowever, proper volume replacement by means of a balanced \nsalt solution such as Lactated Ringer solution will restore per -\nfusion and correct the metabolic acidosis by ending anaerobic \nmetabolism. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 92.)\n 31. Three days after surgery for gastric carcinoma, a 50-year-\nold alcoholic male exhibits delirium, muscle tremors, \nand hyperactive tendon reflexes. Magnesium deficiency \nis suspected. All of the following statements regarding \nthis situation are TRUE EXCEPT:\nA. A decision to administer magnesium should be based \non the serum magnesium level.\nB. Adequate cellular replacement of magnesium will \nrequire 1 to 3 weeks.\nC. A concomitant calcium deficiency should be \nsuspected.\nD. Calcium is a specific antagonist of the myocardial \neffects of magnesium.Answer: A\nMagnesium deficiency should be suspected in any mal -\nnourished patient who exhibits disturbed neuromuscular or \ncerebral activity in the postoperative period. Laboratory con -\nfirmation often is not reliable, and the syndrome may exist in \nthe presence of a normal serum magnesium level. Hypocalce -\nmia often coexists, particularly in patients who have clinical \nsigns of tetany. Intravenous magnesium can be adminis -\ntered safely to a well-hydrated patient for initial treatment \nof a severe deficit, but concomitant electrocardiographic \nmonitoring is essential. The electrocardiographic changes \nassociated with acute hypermagnesemia resemble those of \nhyperkalemia, and calcium chloride or gluconate should be \nreadily available to counteract any adverse myocardial effects \nof excess magnesium ions. Partial or complete relief of symp -\ntoms may follow the initial infusion of magnesium, although \ncontinued replacement for a period of 1 to 3 weeks is neces -\nsary to replenish cellular stores.

Cardiac arrhythmias.Answer: B\nWith refeeding, a shift in metabolism from fat to carbohy -\ndrate substrate stimulates insulin release, which results in \nthe cellular uptake of electrolytes, particularly phosphate, \nmagnesium, potassium, and calcium. However, severe hyper -\nglycemia may result from blunted basal insulin secretion. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 3, p. 98.)\nBrunicardi_Ch03_p013-020.indd   19 30/06/22   10:36 AM"

Von Willebrand factor (vWF)Answer: D\nPlatelets do not normally adhere to each other or to the ves -\nsel wall but can form a plug that aids in cessation of bleeding \nwhen vascular disruption occurs. Injury to the intimal layer \nin the vascular wall exposes subendothelial collagen to which \nplatelets adhere. This process requires vWF, a protein in the \nsubendothelium that is lacking in patients with von Will -\nebrand\u2019s disease. vWF binds to glycoprotein (GP) I/IX/V on \nthe platelet membrane. Following adhesion, platelets initiate \na release reaction that recruits other platelets from the circu -\nlating blood to seal the disrupted vessel. Up to this point, this \nprocess is known as primary hemostasis. Platelet aggregation \nis reversible and is not associated with secretion. Addition -\nally, heparin does not interfere with this reaction, and thus, \nhemostasis can occur in the heparinized patient. ADP and \nserotonin are the principal mediators in platelet aggregation. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 103.) 1. Which of the following is NOT one of the four major \nphysiological events of hemostasis?\nA. Vasodilation\nB. Platelet aggregation\nC. Clot Formation\nD. FibrinolysisAnswer: A\nHemostasis is a complex process, which limits blood loss \nfrom an injured vessel. The four physiologic events of the \nhemostatic process include vasoconstriction, platelet aggre -\ngation, clot formation, and fibrinolysis. These processes are \nthe result of two different cascades, the extrinsic pathway and \nintrinsic pathway. Both cause the conversion of prothrombin \nto thrombin to fibrin, which are essential for clot formation. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 103.)\n 3. Which of the following clotting factors is the first factor \ncommon to both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways?\nA. Factor I (fibrinogen)\nB. Factor IX (Christmas factor)\nC. Factor X (Stewart-Prower factor)\nD. Factor XI (plasma thromboplasma antecedent)Answer: C\nThe intrinsic pathway begins with the activation of factor XII \nthat subsequently activates factors XI, IX, and VIII. In this \npathway, each of the primary factors is \u201cintrinsic\u201d to the cir -\nculating plasma, whereby no surface is required to initiate the \nprocess. In the extrinsic pathway, tissue factor (TF) is released \nor exposed on the surface of the endothelium, binding to \ncirculating factor VII, facilitating its activation to VIIa. Each \nof these pathways continues on to a common sequence that \nbegins with the activation of factor X to Xa (in the presence of \nVIIIa). Subsequently, Xa (with the help of factor Va) converts \nfactor II (prothrombin) to thrombin and then factor I (fibrin -\nogen) to fibrin. Clot formation occurs after fibrin monomers \nare cross-linked to polymers with the assistance of factor XIII. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 105.)CHAPTER 4\nHemostasis, Surgical Bleeding, and Transfusion\nBrunicardi_Ch04_p021-028.indd   21 30/06/22   10:37 AM"

Factor VII\nB. Factor IX\nC. Factor XI\nD. Factor XIIAnswer: D\nCongenital factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency, originally recog -\nnized by Duckert in 1960, is a rare autosomal recessive disease \nusually associated with a severe bleeding diathesis. The male-\nto-female ratio is 1:1. Although acquired FXIII deficiency has \nbeen described in association with hepatic failure, inflam -\nmatory bowel disease, and myeloid leukemia, the only sig -\nnificant association with bleeding in children is the inherited \ndeficiency. Bleeding is typically delayed because clots form \nnormally but are susceptible to fibrinolysis. Umbilical stump \nbleeding is characteristic, and there is a high risk of intracra -\nnial bleeding. Spontaneous abortion is usual in women with \nfactor XIII deficiency unless they receive replacement therapy. \nReplacement can be accomplished with FFP , cryoprecipitate, \nor a factor XIII concentrate. Levels of 1% to 2% are usually \nadequate for hemostasis. (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 107.)\n 6. Which of the following is NOT a cause of \nthrombocytopenia?\nA. Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)\nB. Hemolytic uremia syndrome (HUS)\nC. B12 deficiency\nD. Clopidogrel administrationAnswer: D\nDecrease in number of circulating platelets can be the \nresult of (1) failure of production, (2) shortened survival, \nand (3) sequestration. Failure of production occurs in bone \nmarrow disorders, including leukemias, myelodysplastic \nsyndromes, severe B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, chemo -\ntherapy, radiation treatment, alcohol intoxication, and viral \nsyndromes. Shortened platelet survival is seen in idiopathic \nthrombocytopenia purpura, heparin-induced thrombo -\ncytopenia (HIT), thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura \n(TTP), and in hemolytic uremia syndrome (HUS). Seques -\ntration occurs with trapping of platelets in enlarged spleen \nsecondary to portal hypertension, sarcoid, lymphoma, or \nGaucher\u2019s disease. Clopidogrel does not cause a decrease in \nplatelet number, but irreversibly inhibits platelet function. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 108.) 4. Which of the following factors are NOT involved in pre -\nventing clot propagation?\nA. Thrombomodulin\nB. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) release by the \nendothelium\nC. Nitric oxide release from the endothelium\nD. APC complexes with protein SAnswer: C\nFeedback inhibition on the coagulation cascade deactivates \nthe enzyme complexes leading to thrombin formation. \nThrombomodulin (TM) presented by the endothelium serves \nas a \u201cthrombin sink\u201d by forming a complex with thrombin, \nrendering it no longer available to cleave fibrinogen. This \nthen activates protein C (APC) and reduces further thrombin \ngeneration by inhibiting factors V and VIII. Second, tissue \nplasminogen activator (tPA) is released from the endothelium \nfollowing injury, cleaving plasminogen to initiate fibrinoly -\nsis. APC then consumes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 \n(PAI-1), leading to increased tPA activity and fibrinolysis. \nBuilding on the anticoagulant response to inhibit thrombin \nformation, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is released, \nblocking the TF-VIIa complex and reducing the production \nof factors Xa and IXa. Antithrombin III (AT-III) then neutral -\nizes all of the procoagulant serine proteases and also inhibits \nthe TF-VIIa complex. The most potent mechanism of throm -\nbin inhibition involves the APC system. APC forms a com -\nplex with its cofactor, protein S, on a phospholipid surface. \nThis complex then cleaves factors Va and VIIIa so that they \nare no longer able to participate in the formation of TF-VIIa \nor prothrombinase complexes.

What drug irreversibly inhibits platelet function by irre -\nversible acetylation of platelet prostaglandin synthase?\nA. Aspirin\nB. Clopidogrel\nC. Dipyridamole\nD. Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitorsAnswer: A\nDrugs that interfere with platelet function include aspirin, \nclopidogrel, prasugrel, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibi -\ntors. Aspirin, clopidogrel, and prasugrel all irreversibly inhibit \nplatelet function. Clopidogrel and prasugrel do so through \nselective irreversible inhibition of ADP-induced platelet \naggregation.

Massive blood transfusion following Trauma\nB. Acute renal failure\nC. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nD. Polycythemia veraAnswer: C\nImpaired platelet function often accompanies thrombocyto -\npenia, but may also occur in the presence of a normal platelet \ncount. The importance of this is obvious when one considers \nthat 80% of overall clot strength is related to platelet function. \nThe life span of platelets ranges from 7 to 10 days, placing them \nat increased risk for impairment by medical disorders and pre -\nscription and over-the-counter medications. Impairment of \nADP-stimulated aggregation occurs with massive transfusion of \nblood products. Uremia may be associated with increased bleed -\ning time and impaired aggregation. Defective aggregation and \nplatelet dysfunction are also seen in patients with severe trauma, \nthrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis.\nDIC is an acquired syndrome characterized by systemic \nactivation of coagulation pathways that result in excessive \nthrombin generation and diffuse formation of microthrombi. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 110.)\n 10. Which is TRUE about trauma-induced coagulopathy \n(TIC)?\nA. The acute coagulopathy of trauma is mechanistically \nsimilar to disseminated intravascular coagulation \n(DIC).\nB. Coagulopathy can develop in trauma patients fol -\nlowing acidosis, hypothermia, and dilution of coag -\nulation factors though coagulation is normal on \nadmission.\nC. TIC is caused by shock and tissue injury.\nD. Acute coagulopathy of trauma is mainly a dilutional \ncoagulopathy.Answer: C\nTraditional teaching regarding trauma-related coagulopathy \nattributed its development to acidosis, hypothermia, and dilu -\ntion of coagulation factors. Recent data, however, have shown \nthat over one-third of severely injured patients have laboratory-  \nbased evidence of coagulopathy at the time of admission, a \nphenotype called trauma- TIC. TIC is independent of tra -\nditional (iatrogenic) causes of posttraumatic coagulopathy, \nsuch as hemodilution, is precipitated by tissue injury and/or \nhemorrhagic shock, and is associated with significantly higher \nrisk of mortality, especially in the first 24 hours after injury. \nFurthermore, TIC is a separate and distinct process from dis -\nseminated intravascular coagulopathy with its own specific \ncomponents of hemostatic failure. (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 111.) 7. Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP):\nA. Occurs more often in children with adults, but has a \nsimilar clinical course.\nB. Includes HIT as a subtype of drug-induced ITP .\nC. is also known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic pur -\npura (TTP).\nD. is a disease of impaired platelet production of \nunknown etiology.Answer: B\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia is also known as idio -\npathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In children, it is \nusually acute at the onset, short-lived, and typically follows \na viral illness. In contrast, ITP in adults is gradual in onset, \nchronic in nature, and has no identifiable cause. Because the \ncirculating platelets in ITP are young and functional, bleeding \nis less for a given platelet count than when there is failure of \nplatelet production. The pathophysiology of ITP is believed to \ninvolve both impaired platelet production and T cell\u2013medi -\nated platelet destruction. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia \n(HIT) is a form of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. \nIt is an immunologic event during which antibodies against \nplatelet factor 4 formed during exposure to heparin affect \nplatelet activation and endothelial function with resultant \nthrombocytopenia and intravascular thrombosis. TTP is a dis -\norder of platelet activation and production of platelet thrombi. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 108.)\nBrunicardi_Ch04_p021-028.indd   23 30/06/22   10:37 AM"

Platelet count \nis measured at 45,000 platelets per milliliter. Y ou sus -\npect this is due to Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia \n(HIT). Which of the following is TRUE?\nA. HIT is due to an antibody against platelet factor 4 \n(PF4).\nB. This can only occur with full dose unfractionated \nheparin.\nC. HIT is avoided by using fractionated heparins only.\nD. Anticoagulation with oral warfarin should be initi -\nated immediately.Answer: A\nHIT is a drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Anti -\nbodies against platelet factor 4 (PL4) cause destruction of \nplatelets. Platelet count falls on 5 to 7 days after starting \nheparin therapy, but sooner, 1 to 2 days after reexposure. \nHIT generally occurs after treatment with full -dose unfrac -\ntionated heparins, but can occur with prophylactic doses or \nwith low molecular weight (fractionated) heparins. The clini -\ncal diagnosis of HIT is confirmed by a positive anti-platelet \nfactor 4. In addition to thrombocytopenia, HIT is associated \nwith arterial and venous thrombosis. Heparins are discon -\ntinued, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin, \nargatroban, or danaparoid is prescribed. Warfarin therapy \nshould be started only after anticoagulation it can initially \ninduce a hypercoagulable state (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 109.) 11.

PCC more rapidly corrects INR but is associated with \nexcess thromboembolic events.\nD. Four-factor PCC\u2019s have more reliable correction of \nINR compared to three-factor PCCs.Answer: B\nAlthough warfarin use is often associated with a signifi -\ncant increase in morbidity and mortality in acutely injured \nand emergency surgery patients, with rapid reversal, these \ncomplications can be reduced. There are several reversal \noptions that include vitamin K administration, plasma, \ncryoprecipitate, recombinant factor VIIa, and factor con -\ncentrates. The 2012 CHEST guidelines for the Manage -\nment of Anticoagulant Therapy, Antithrombotic Therapy, \nand Prevention of Thrombosis recommends patients with \nmajor life-threatening bleeding due to warfarin receive \nreversal with vitamin K and a rapid reversal agent such as \nplasma or PCC. Vitamin K is given to sustain the effects of \nthe plasma or PCC due to their short half-lives. In major \nbleeds, vitamin K 10 mg given as a slow IV infusion is uti -\nlized for more rapid onset compared to the oral form. Stud -\nies have shown that PCC is superior to plasma for speed \nof reversal and has decreased risk of fluid overload, but it \nis equivalent in adverse and thromboembolic events and \ncostlier. PCC is available in two forms: three-factor PCC \n(factors II, IX, and X) and four-factor PCC (factors II, VII, \nIX, and X). Four-factor PCCs have been shown to have a \nmore reliable correction of INR compared to three-factor \nPCCs. (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 112.)\n 14.

The administration of Rh-positive red blood cells is \nacceptable if Rh-negative red blood cells blood is not \navailable.\nD. Crossmatched whole blood may be ideal therapy for \nresuscitation of trauma patients.Answer: C\nPlatelets do not require crossmatching. In emergency situ -\nations, universal donor type O-negative red blood cells and \ntype AB plasma may be transfused to all recipients. Due to \na shortage of type AB plasma, low anti-B titer type A plasma \nhas become widely adopted for emergency (uncrossmatched) \ntransfusion. In the United States, 85% of individuals are \ntype A or type O, making type A plasma compatible with \nthe vast majority of potential recipients. Uncrossmatched \nplasma is routinely transfused as part of platelet transfusions, \nwith major transfusion reactions reported rarely, and type \nAB plasma currently carries a higher risk of TRALI com -\npared to other plasma types. Many centers have transitioned \nto low-titer type A plasma for emergency transfusions, with \nno increase in adverse events. O negative and type-specific \nred blood cells are equally safe for emergency transfusion. \nIn patients known to have clinically significant cold aggluti -\nnins, blood should be administered through a blood warmer. \nIf these antibodies are present in high titer, hypothermia is \ncontraindicated. Whole blood as an ideal therapy for acute \ntraumatic hemorrhagic shock has increased in the last several \nyears with multiple reports of successful use in military and \ncivilian trauma patients.

Contact with circuit tubing and membranes activates \ninflammatory cascades and causes anormal platelet \nand clotting factor function.\nB. Coagulopathy is compounded by sheer stress.\nC. Following bypass, platelet morphology and ability to \naggregate are irreversibly altered.\nD. Coagulopathy is compounded by hypothermia and \nhemodilution.Answer: C\nUnder normal conditions, homeostasis of the coagulation \nsystem is maintained by complex interactions between the \nendothelium, platelets, and coagulation factors. In patients \nundergoing CPB, contact with circuit tubing and mem -\nbranes results in abnormal platelet and clotting factor acti -\nvation, as well as activation of inflammatory cascades, that \nultimately results in excessive fibrinolysis and a combination \nof both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects. Platelets \nundergo reversible alterations in morphology and their ability \nto aggregate, which causes sequestration in the filter, partially \ndegranulated platelets, and platelet fragments. This multifac -\ntorial coagulopathy is compounded by the effects of shear \nstress in the system, induced hypothermia, hemodilution, and \nanticoagulation. (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 113.)\n 17.

Use of hemostatic adjunctsAnswer: B\nPrior to DCR, resuscitation guidelines advocated volume \nreplacement with crystalloid, followed by packed red blood cell \nand only later plasma or platelets. This conventional massive \ntransfusion practice was based on a several small uncontrolled \nretrospective studies that used blood products containing \nincreased amounts of plasma, which are no longer available. \nBecause of the known early coagulopathy of trauma, the cur -\nrent approach to managing the exsanguinating patient involves \nearly implementation of DCR. Although most of the attention \nto hemorrhagic shock resuscitation has centered on higher \nratios of plasma and platelets, DCR is composed of four basic \ncomponents: permissive hypotension, minimizing crystalloid-\nbased resuscitation, the immediate release and administration \nof predefined balanced blood products (red blood cells, plasma, \nand platelets) in ratios similar to those of whole blood, and the \nuse of hemostatic adjuncts.

In \nthis trial, the 1:1:1 group had significantly decreased mor -\ntality due to hemorrhage at 24 hours (9% vs 15%) and more \npatients achieving hemostasis (86% vs 78%).

Waiting for \nINR and platelet count appears to delay achieving hemostasis. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 119.)hemoglobin levels between 7 and 9 g/dL had no adverse \neffect on mortality. In fact, patients with APACHE II scores \nof \u226420 or patients age <55 years actually had a lower mortal -\nity. SCCM/EAST and AABB guidelines recommend taking \ninto account patient-specific characteristics and the overall \nclinical context when considering RBC transfusions in non-\nacutely hemorrhaging patients. Patients with symptomatic \nanemia should be transfused 1 RBC unit at a time, and iso -\nlated asymptomatic anemia in and of itself is rarely an indica -\ntion for RBC transfusion.

Which of the follow -\ning is the leading cause of transfusion-related deaths?\nA. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)\nB. ABO hemolytic transfusion reactions\nC. Bacterial contamination of platelets\nD. Iatrogenic hepatitis C: infectionAnswer: A\nTransfusion-related complications are primarily related \nto blood-induced proinflammatory responses (Table 4-9). \nTransfusion-related 149a events are estimated to occur in \napproximately 10% of all transfusions, but <0.5% are serious \nin nature. Transfusion-related deaths, although exceedingly \nrare, do occur and are related primarily to transfusion-related \nacute lung injury (TRALI), ABO hemolytic transfusion reac -\ntions, and bacterial contamination of platelets.

All of the aboveAnswer: D\nRecent trauma data has shown TEG to be useful in predict -\ning early transfusion of red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and \ncryoprecipitate. TEG can also predict the need for lifesaving \ninterventions shortly after arrival, 24-hour and 30-day mor -\ntality, and can be used to guide administration of Tranexamic \nAcid (TXA) to injured patients with hyperfibrinolysis. Lastly, \nsome centers have demonstrated that the graphic display \noptions allow for more rapid return of results and may be less \nexpensive than standard coagulation panels. Given the strong \nassociation of viscoelastic tests with clinical outcomes, some \ncenters now use TEG rather than conventional coagulation \ntests to evaluate injured patients in the emergency depart -\nment.

Zika and West Nile Virus.\nD. All of the above.Answer: A\nMalaria, Chagas\u2019 disease, brucellosis, and, very rarely, syphilis \nare among the diseases that have been transmitted by transfu -\nsion. Transmission of hepatitis C and HIV-1 has been dra -\nmatically minimized by the introduction of better antibody \nand nucleic acid screening for these pathogens. The residual \nrisk among allogeneic donations is now estimated to be less \nthan 1 per 1,000,000 donations. Recent concerns about the \nrare transmission of these and other pathogens, such as West \nNile virus, are being addressed by current trials of \u201cpathogen  \ninactivation systems\u201d that reduce infectious levels of all \nviruses and bacteria known to be transmittable by transfusion. \nRecently, there is heightened concern of transmission of Zika \nvirus by blood product transfusion. Studies in endemic areas \nhave shown rates of Zika infection detected in donor blood as \nhigh as 2.8%. Although no such cases have been reported in \nthe United States, transmission of Zika virus via platelet prod -\nucts have been reported in Brazil. (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 123.) 21. TRALI does not include:\nA. Transfusion-related circulatory overload (TACO).\nB. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.\nC. Fever and rigors.\nD. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.Answer: A\nThe syndrome of TRALI is defined as noncardiogenic pul -\nmonary edema related to transfusion. It can occur with the \nadministration of any plasma-containing blood product. \nSymptoms are similar to circulatory overload with dyspnea \nand associated hypoxemia. However, TRALI is characterized \nas noncardiogenic and is often accompanied by fever, rigors, \nand bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. It most \ncommonly occurs within 1 to 2 hours after the onset of trans -\nfusion but virtually always before 6 hours. Toy et al reported \na decrease in the incidence of TRALI with the reduction of \ntransfusion of plasma from female donors, due to a combina -\ntion of reduced transfusion of strong cognate HLA class II \nantibodies and HNA antibodies in patients with risk factors \nfor acute lung injury. TRALI now occurs <1 in 10,000 units \ntransfused and is usually self-limited with supportive therapy. \nTreatment of TRALI entails discontinuation of any transfu -\nsion, notification of the transfusion service, and pulmonary \nsupport, which may vary from supplemental oxygen to \nmechanical ventilation.\nRespiratory compromise may also be associated with \nTACO, which is an avoidable complication. It can occur with \nrapid infusion of blood, plasma expanders, and crystalloids, \nparticularly in older patients with underlying heart disease. \n(Schwartz 11th ed., p. 121.)\nBrunicardi_Ch04_p021-028.indd   27 30/06/22   10:37 AM"

The r-value represents the clotting factor activity and \ninitial fibrin formation and is increased with factor \ndeficiency or severe hemodilution.\nB. K time is prolonged with hypofibrinogenemia and \nsignificant factor deficiency.\nC. Decreased (alpha) or \u221d angle is treated with cryopre -\ncipitate transfusion or fibrinogen administration.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nSeveral parameters are generated from the TEG tracing. The \nr-value (reaction time) represents the time between the start \nof the assay and initial clot formation. This reflects clotting \nfactor activity and initial fibrin formation and is increased \nwith factor deficiency or severe hemodilution. The k-time \n(clot kinetics) is the time needed to reach specified clot \nstrength and represents the interactions of clotting factors and \nplatelets. As such, the k-time is prolonged with hypofibrino -\ngenemia and significant factor deficiency. Prolonged r-value \nand k-time are commonly addressed with plasma transfu -\nsions. The alpha or angle ( \u221d) is the slope of the tracing and \nreflects clot acceleration. The angle reflects the interactions \nof clotting factors and platelets. The slope is decreased with \nhypofibrinogenemia and platelet dysfunction. Decreased \nangles are treated with cryoprecipitate transfusion or fibrin -\nogen administration. The maximal amplitude (mA) is the \ngreatest height of the tracing and represents clot strength. Its \nheight is reduced with dysfunction or deficiencies in plate -\nlets or fibrinogen. Decreased mA is addressed with platelet \ntransfusion and, in cases where the angle is also decreased, \nwith cryoprecipitate (or fibrinogen) as well. The G-value is a \nparametric measure derived from the mA value and reflects \noverall clot strength or firmness. An increased G-value is \nassociated with hypercoagulability, whereas a decrease is seen \nwith hypocoagulable states. Finally, the LY30 is the amount \nof lysis occurring in the clot, and the value is the percentage \nof amplitude reduction at 30 minutes after mA is achieved. \nThe LY30 represents clot stability and presence of increased \nfibrinolysis.

Obstructive shock.Answer: D\nIn 1934, Blalock proposed four categories of shock: hypovo -\nlemic, vasogenic, neurogenic, and cardiogenic. Hypovolemic \nshock , the most common type, results from loss of circu -\nlating blood volume. This may result from loss of whole \nblood (hemorrhagic shock), plasma, interstitial fluid (bowel \nobstruction), or a combination. Vasogenic shock  results from \ndecreased resistance within capacitance vessels, usually seen \nin sepsis. Neurogenic shock  is a form of vasogenic shock in \nwhich spinal cord injury or spinal anesthesia causes vasodila -\ntion due to acute loss of sympathetic vascular tone. Cardio -\ngenic shock  results from failure of the heart as a pump, as in \narrhythmias, or acute myocardial infarction (MI).\nIn recent clinical practice, further classification has described \nsix types of shock: hypovolemic, septic (vasodilatory), neuro -\ngenic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and traumatic shock. Obstruc -\ntive shock  is a form of cardiogenic shock that results from \nmechanical impediment to circulation leading to depressed \ncardiac output rather than primary cardiac failure. This \nincludes etiologies such as pulmonary embolism or tension \npneumothorax. In traumatic shock , soft tissue and bony injury \nlead to the activation of inflammatory cells and the release of \ncirculating factors, such as cytokines and intracellular mol -\necules that modulate the immune response. Recent investiga -\ntions have revealed that the inflammatory mediators released \nin response to tissue injury (damage-associated molecular \npatterns [DAMPs]) are recognized by many of the same cel -\nlular receptors (pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) and \nactivate similar signaling pathways as do bacterial products \nelaborated in sepsis (pathogen-associated molecular patterns \n[PAMPs]), such as lipopolysaccharide. These effects of tissue \ninjury are combined with the effects of hemorrhage, creating \na more complex and amplified deviation from homeostasis. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 150.)CHAPTER 5\nShock\nBrunicardi_Ch05_p029-036.indd   29 30/06/22   10:38 AM"

HCO3\u2013 concentration\nD. Carbon dioxide levelsAnswer: C\nChemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid bodies are sensitive to \nchanges in O2 tension, H+ ion concentration, and carbon diox -\nide (CO2) levels. Stimulation of the chemoreceptors results in \nvasodilation of the coronary arteries, slowing of the heart rate, \nand vasoconstriction of the splanchnic and skeletal circulation.  \nIn addition, a variety of protein and nonprotein mediators \nare produced at the site of injury as part of the inflammatory \nresponse, and they act as afferent impulses to induce a host \nresponse. These mediators include histamine, cytokines, eico -\nsanoids, and endothelins. ( See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 134.)\n 4. Neurogenic shock is characterized by the presence of:\nA. Cool, moist skin.\nB. Increased cardiac output.\nC. Decreased peripheral vascular resistance.\nD. Decreased blood volume.Answer: C\nNeurogenic shock is caused by loss of arteriolar and venular \ntone in response to paralysis (such as occurs with high spi -\nnal anesthesia), acute gastric dilatation, or sudden pain or \nunpleasant sights; as such, it is characterized by a decrease in \nperipheral vascular resistance. Affected patients usually pres -\nent with warm, dry skin, a pulse rate that is slower than nor -\nmal, and hypotension. A normovolemic state usually exists, \nand urine output is generally well maintained. Although \nblood volume measurements indicate a normal intravascular \nvolume, because of the greatly increased reservoir capacity of \nthe arterioles and venules, there is a decrease in cardiac output \nsecondary to decreased venous return to the right side of the \nheart. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 151.)\n 5. When a patient with hemorrhagic shock is resuscitated \nusing an intravenous colloid solution rather than lac -\ntated Ringer\u2019s solution, all of the following statements are \nTRUE EXCEPT:\nA. Circulating levels of immunoglobulins are decreased.\nB. Colloid solutions may bind to the ionized fraction of \nserum calcium.\nC. Endogenous production of albumin is decreased.\nD. Extracellular fluid volume deficit is restored.Answer: D\nBecause of higher osmotic pressure, colloid solutions draw \nextracellular fluid into the vascular space, increasing the \nextracellular fluid deficit. In addition, the ionized fraction \nof serum calcium is decreased, circulating levels of immu -\nnoglobulin drop; and reaction to tetanus toxoid given to the \npatient suffering from major trauma is decreased. Endoge -\nnous production of albumin also decreases. Colloid resusci -\ntation is no more effective than crystalloid resuscitation, and \nit is more expensive and its use in bleeding trauma patients \nis associated with an increased risk of death. (See Schwartz \n10th ed., p. 144.) 2. What is TRUE about baroreceptors?\nA. Volume receptors can be activated in hemorrhage \nwith reduction in left atrial pressure.\nB. Receptors in the aortic arch and carotid bodies inhibit \nthe autonomic nervous system when stretched.\nC. When baroreceptors are stretched, they induced \nincreased autonomic nervous system output and pro -\nduce constriction of peripheral vessels.\nD. None of the above.Answer: B\nBaroreceptors also are an important afferent pathway in initi -\nation of adaptive responses to shock. Volume receptors, sensi -\ntive to changes in both chamber pressure and wall stretch, are \npresent within the atria of the heart. They become activated \nwith low-volume hemorrhage or mild reductions in right \natrial pressure. Receptors in the aortic arch and carotid bod -\nies respond to alterations in pressure or stretch of the arterial \nwall, responding to larger reductions in intravascular volume \nor pressure. These receptors normally inhibit induction of \nthe autonomic nervous system. When activated, these baro -\nreceptors diminish their output, thus disinhibiting the effect \nof the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous \nsystem then increases its output, principally via sympathetic \nactivation at the vasomotor centers of the brain stem, pro -\nducing centrally mediated constriction of peripheral vessels.  \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 134.)\nBrunicardi_Ch05_p029-036.indd   30 30/06/22   10:38 AM"

LipogenesisAnswer: A\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine have a profound impact \non cellular metabolism. Hepatic glycogenolysis, gluconeo -\ngenesis, ketogenesis, skeletal muscle protein breakdown, and \nadipose tissue lipolysis are increased by catecholamines. Cor -\ntisol, glucagon, and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) also con -\ntribute to the catabolism during shock. Epinephrine induces \nfurther release of glucagon, while inhibiting the pancreatic \n\u03b2-cell release of insulin. The result is a catabolic state with glu -\ncose mobilization, hyperglycemia, protein breakdown, nega -\ntive nitrogen balance, lipolysis, and insulin resistance during \nshock and injury. The relative underuse of glucose by periph -\neral tissues preserves it for the glucose-dependent organs, such \nas the heart and brain. ( See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 137.) 7. Which of the following is TRUE about anti-diuretic hor -\nmone (ADH) production in injured patients?\nA. ADH acts as a potent mesenteric vasoconstrictor.\nB. ADH levels fall to normal within 2\u20133 days of the ini -\ntial insult.\nC. ADH decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis.\nD. ADH secretion is mediated by the renin-angiotensin \nsystem.Answer: A\nThe pituitary also releases vasopressin or ADH in response to \nhypovolemia, changes in circulating blood volume sensed by \nbaroreceptors and left atrial stretch receptors, and increased \nplasma osmolality detected by hypothalamic osmorecep -\ntors. Epinephrine, angiotensin II, pain, and hyperglycemia \nincrease production of ADH. ADH levels remain elevated \nfor about 1 week after the initial insult, depending on the \nseverity and persistence of the hemodynamic abnormali -\nties. ADH acts on the distal tubule and collecting duct of \nthe nephron to increase water permeability, decrease water \nand sodium losses, and preserve intravascular volume. Also \nknown as arginine vasopressin, ADH acts as a potent mes -\nenteric vasoconstrictor, shunting circulating blood away \nfrom the splanchnic organs during hypovolemia. This may \ncontribute to intestinal ischemia and predispose to intestinal \nmucosal barrier dysfunction in shock states. Vasopressin also \nincreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases hepatic gly -\ncolysis. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 135.)\n 9. A patient has a blood pressure of 70/50 mm Hg and a \nserum lactate level of 30 mg/100 mL (normal: 6 to 16). \nTheir cardiac output is 1.9 L/min, and his central venous \npressure is 2 cm H2O. The most likely diagnosis is:\nA. Congestive heart failure.\nB. Cardiac tamponade.\nC. Hypovolemic shock.\nD. Septic shock.Answer: C\nThe findings given in the question are characteristic of \nhypovolemic shock, which can be defined as inadequate tis -\nsue perfusion secondary to an extracellular fluid loss. The \nhigh lactate level is a result of anaerobic metabolism due to \ndecreased blood flow to tissues. The hemodynamic measure -\nments indicate both low blood flow and low venous return. \nThe total combination is most consistent with a diagnosis of \nhypovolemic shock.

Which categories of \nshock are associated with vasodilation of larger arterioles?\nA. Septic shock\nB. Cardiogenic shock\nC. Neurogenic shock\nD. A and CAnswer: D\nThe microvascular circulation plays an integral role in regu -\nlating cellular perfusion and is significantly influenced in \nresponse to shock. The microvascular bed is innervated by \nthe sympathetic nervous system and has a profound effect on \nthe larger arterioles. Following hemorrhage, larger arterioles \nvasoconstrict; however, in the setting of sepsis or neurogenic \nshock, these vessels vasodilate. Additionally, a host of other \nvasoactive proteins, including vasopressin, angiotensin II, \nand endothelin-1, also lead to vasoconstriction to limit organ \nperfusion to organs such as skin, skeletal muscle, kidneys, \nand the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to preserve perfusion of \nthe myocardium and central nervous system (CNS).

Which of the following cytokines is elevated after shock \nand trauma and plays an important role in the develop -\nment of diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS)?\nA. IL-10\nB. TNF-\u03b1\nC. IL-6\nD. IL-1Answer: C\nIL-6 is elevated in response to hemorrhagic shock and cor -\nrelates with mortality in shock states. IL-6 contributes to \norgan injury after hemorrhage shock, especially alveolar \ndamage and ARDS. IL-10 is considered an anti-inflammatory \ncytokine that may have immunosuppressive properties. Its \nproduction is increased after shock and trauma, and it has \nbeen associated with depressed immune function clinically, \nas well as an increased susceptibility to infection. TNF-\u03b1 \nmay be induced by bacteria or endotoxin and leads to the \ndevelopment of shock and hypoperfusion, most commonly \nobserved in septic shock. IL-1 has similar actions to TNF-\u03b1,  \nand is especially notable for its production of the febrile \nresponse to injury through the activation of prostaglandins. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 138.)\n 11.

Releases a number of substances that may induce \ncell or tissue injury, such as reactive O2 species, lipid-\nperoxidation products, proteolytic enzymes, and \nvasoactive mediators.Answer: A\nThe complement cascade can be activated by injury, shock, \nand severe infection, and contributes to host defense and \nproinflammatory activation. In trauma patients, the degree \nof complement activation is proportional to the magni -\ntude of injury and may serve as a marker for severity of \ninjury. Activated complement factors C3a, C4a, and C5a are \npotent mediators of increased vascular permeability, smooth \nmuscle cell contraction, histamine and arachidonic acid \nby-product release, and adherence of neutrophils to vascu -\nlar endothelium. Activated complement acts synergistically \nwith endotoxin to induce the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. \nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome \n(ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) \nin trauma patients correlates with the intensity of comple -\nment activation. Complement and neutrophil activation may \ncorrelate with mortality in multiply injured patients. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 140.)\n 12. A 70-kg male patient presents emergency department \n(ED) following a gunshot wound to the left lower quad -\nrant wound to the abdomen. His blood pressure is 88/62 \nand his heart rate is 122. He is alert, but confused and \nintermittently combative with first responders. What \npercent of blood volume has he lost?\nA. 5%\nB. 15%\nC. 35%\nD. 55%Answer: C\nThe clinical signs of shock may be evidenced by agitation, \ncool clammy extremities, tachycardia, weak or absent periph -\neral pulses, and hypotension. Such apparent clinical shock \nresults from at least 25% to 30% loss of the blood volume. \nHowever, substantial volumes of blood may be lost before \nthe classic clinical manifestations of shock are evident. Thus, \nwhen a patient is significantly tachycardic or hypotensive, \nthis represents both significant blood loss and physiologic \ndecompensation. The clinical and physiologic response to \nhemorrhage has been classified according to the magnitude \nof volume loss. Loss of up to 15% of the circulating vol -\nume (700\u2013750 mL for a 70-kg patient) may produce little in \nterms of obvious symptoms, while loss of up to 30% of the \ncirculating volume (1.5 L) may result in mild tachycardia, \ntachypnea, and anxiety. Hypotension, marked tachycardia failure, and cardiac tamponade are all associated with a high \ncentral venous pressure. Septic shock, particularly in its early \nphases, is usually hyperdynamic, and affected patients have \na greater-than-normal cardiac output. Complete hemo -\ndynamic monitoring is vital in hypovolemic shock so that \nprompt diagnosis and rational therapy can be expeditiously \ncarried out.

Leads to suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.\nC. Can also be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.\nD. Is similar to early cardiogenic shock.Answer: C\nIn the peripheral circulation, profound vasoconstriction \nis the typical physiologic response to the decreased arterial \npressure and tissue perfusion with hemorrhage, hypovolemia, \nor acute heart failure. This is not the characteristic response \nin vasodilatory shock. Vasodilatory shock is the result of dys -\nfunction of the endothelium and vasculature secondary to \ncirculating inflammatory mediators and cells or as a response \nto prolonged and severe hypoperfusion. Thus, in vasodila -\ntory shock, hypotension results from failure of the vascular \nsmooth muscle to constrict appropriately. Vasodilatory shock \nis characterized by peripheral vasodilation with resultant \nhypotension and resistance to treatment with vasopressors. \nDespite the hypotension, plasma catecholamine levels are \nelevated, and the renin-angiotensin system is activated in \nvasodilatory shock. The most frequently encountered form of \nvasodilatory shock is septic shock. Other causes of vasodi -\nlatory shock include hypoxic lactic acidosis, carbon monox -\nide poisoning, decompensated and irreversible hemorrhagic \nshock, terminal cardiogenic shock, and postcardiotomy \nshock. Thus, vasodilatory shock seems to represent the final \ncommon pathway for profound and prolonged shock of any \netiology. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 145.)\n 14.

MilrinoneAnswer: B\nAfter first-line therapy of the septic patient with the rapid \nadministration of antibiotics, IV fluids, and intubation if nec -\nessary, vasopressors may be necessary to treat patients with \nseptic shock. Catecholamines are the vasopressors used most \noften, with norepinephrine being the first-line agent followed \nby epinephrine. Occasionally, patients with septic shock will \ndevelop arterial resistance to catecholamines.

Hypoglycemia and insulin resistance best treated \nwith intensive maintenance of blood glucose between \n80 and 110 mg/dL to reduce hypoglycemic neuro -\nlogic derailments, mortality, and septicemiaAnswer: C\nHyperglycemia and insulin resistance are typical in critically \nill and septic patients, including patients without underly -\ning diabetes mellitus. A recent study reported significant \npositive impact of tight glucose management on outcome in \ncritically ill patients. The two treatment groups in this ran -\ndomized, prospective study were assigned to receive inten -\nsive insulin therapy (maintenance of blood glucose between \n80 and 110 mg/dL) or conventional treatment (infusion of \ninsulin only if the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg/dL, \nwith a goal between 180 and 200 mg/dL). The mean morn -\ning glucose level was significantly higher in the conventional \ntreatment as compared to the intensive insulin therapy group \n(153 vs 103 mg/dL). Mortality in the intensive insulin treat -\nment group (4.6%) was significantly lower than in the conven -\ntional treatment group (8%), representing a 42% reduction in \nmortality. This reduction in mortality was most notable in the (ie, pulse >110\u2013120 beats per minute [bpm]), and confusion \nmay not be evident until >30% of the blood volume has been \nlost; loss of 40% of circulating volume (2 L) is immediately \nlife-threatening, and generally requires operative control of \nbleeding.

Is secondary to inadequate intravascular volume.\nC. Confers a mortality rate of 50%\u201380%.\nD. Permissive hypotension reduces afterload resulting \nin improved cardiac perfusion.Answer: C\nCardiogenic shock is defined clinically as circulatory pump \nfailure leading to diminished forward flow and subsequent \ntissue hypoxia, in the setting of adequate intravascular vol -\nume. Hemodynamic criteria include sustained hypotension \n(ie, SBP < 90 mmHg for at least 30 minutes), reduced cardiac \nindex (<2.2 L/min per square meter), and elevated pulmo -\nnary artery wedge pressure (>15 mm Hg). Mortality rates for \ncardiogenic shock are 50% to 80%. Acute, extensive MI is the \nmost common cause of cardiogenic shock; a smaller infarc -\ntion in a patient with existing left ventricular dysfunction \nalso may precipitate shock. Cardiogenic shock complicates \n5% to 10% of acute myocardial infarction (MIs). Conversely, \ncardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death in \npatients hospitalized with acute MI. Although shock may \ndevelop early after MI, it typically is not found on admission. \nSeventy-five percent of patients who have cardiogenic shock \ncomplicating acute MIs develop signs of cardiogenic shock \nwithin 24 hours after onset of infarction (average 7 hours). \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 148.)\n 17. Treatment for cardiogenic shock includes:\nA. Established circulatory support prior to addressing \nassociated respiratory failure.\nB. Adequate oxygenation to ensure adequate myocar -\ndial O2 delivery and liberal fluid administration to \nimprove peripheral perfusion.\nC. Dopamine administration to increase cardiac out -\nput and vasodilate peripheral vascular beds to total \nperipheral resistance.\nD. Intra-aortic balloon pump, initiated prior to cardio -\ntonic medications.Answer: C\nAfter ensuring that an adequate airway is present and venti -\nlation is sufficient, attention should be focused on support of \nthe circulation. Intubation and mechanical ventilation often \nare required, if only to decrease work of breathing and facili -\ntate sedation of the patient. Rapidly excluding hypovolemia \nand establishing the presence of cardiac dysfunction are \nessential. Treatment of cardiac dysfunction includes mainte -\nnance of adequate oxygenation to ensure adequate myocar -\ndial O2 delivery and judicious fluid administration to avoid \nfluid overload and development of cardiogenic pulmonary \nedema. When profound cardiac dysfunction exists, inotropic \nsupport may be indicated to improve cardiac contractility \nand cardiac output. Dobutamine primarily stimulates cardiac \n\u03b21-receptors to increase cardiac output, but may also vaso -\ndilate peripheral vascular beds, lower total peripheral resis -\ntance, and lower systemic blood pressure through effects on \n\u03b22-receptors. Ensuring adequate preload and intravascular \nvolume is therefore essential prior to instituting therapy with \ndobutamine. Dopamine stimulates receptors (vasoconstric -\ntion), \u03b21-receptors (cardiac stimulation), and \u03b22-receptors \n(vasodilation), with its effects on \u03b2-receptors predominating \nat lower doses. Dopamine may be preferable to dobutamine \nin treatment of cardiac dysfunction in hypotensive patients. \nPatients whose cardiac dysfunction is refractory to cardio -\ntonics may require mechanical circulatory support with an \nintra-aortic balloon pump. Intra-aortic balloon pumping \nincreases cardiac output and improves coronary blood flow \nby reduction of systolic afterload and augmentation of dia -\nstolic perfusion pressure.

Resolution of hypotension and tachycardia without \npharmacologic intervention, but rising lactateAnswer: B\nRecognition by care providers of the patient who is in the \ncompensated phase of shock is equally important, but more \ndifficult based on clinical criteria. Compensated shock exists \nwhen inadequate tissue perfusion persists despite normaliza -\ntion of blood pressure and heart rate. Even with normaliza -\ntion of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output, 80% to \n85% of trauma patients have inadequate tissue perfusion, as \nevidenced by increased lactate or decreased mixed venous O2 \nsaturation. Persistent, occult hypoperfusion is frequent in the \nICU, with a resultant significant increase in infection rate and \nmortality in major trauma patients. Patients failing to reverse \ntheir lactic acidosis within 12 hours of admission (acidosis \nthat was persistent despite normal heart rate, blood pressure, \nand urine output) developed an infection three times as often \nas those who normalized their lactate levels within 12 hours \nof admission. In addition, mortality was fourfold higher in \npatients who developed infections. Both injury severity score \nand occult hypotension (lactic acidosis) longer than 12 hours \nwere independent predictors of infection. Thus, recognition \nof subclinical hypoperfusion requires information beyond \nvital signs and urinary output.\nEndpoints in resuscitation can be divided into systemic  \nor global parameters, tissue-specific parameters,  and cellular \nparameters . Global endpoints include vital signs, cardiac output, \npulmonary artery wedge pressure, O2 delivery and consump -\ntion, lactate, and base deficit. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 152.) 18.

Which is persistently elevated is evidence of hospital-\nacquired infection following a traumatic event.\nD. Does not provide additional information in clinical \nresuscitation when serum lactates can be assessed.Answer: A\nBase deficit is the amount of base in millimoles that is \nrequired to titrate 1 L of whole blood to a pH of 7.40 with \nthe sample fully saturated with O2 at 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) and a par -\ntial pressure of CO2 of 40 mm Hg. It usually is measured by \narterial blood gas analysis in clinical practice as it is readily \nand quickly available. The mortality of trauma patients can \nbe stratified according to the magnitude of base deficit mea -\nsured in the first 24 hours after admission. In a retrospec -\ntive study of over 3000 trauma admissions, patients with a \nbase deficit worse than 15 mmol/L had a mortality of 70%. \nBase deficit can be stratified into mild (3\u20135 mmol/L), moder -\nate (6\u201314 mmol/L), and severe (15 mmol/L) categories, with \na trend toward higher mortality with worsening base deficit \nin patients with trauma. Both the magnitude of the perfusion \ndeficit as indicated by the base deficit and the time required \nto correct it are major factors determining outcome in shock.\nIndeed, when elevated base deficit persists (or lactic \nacidosis) in the trauma patient, ongoing bleeding is often \nthe etiology. Trauma patients admitted with a base deficit \n>15 mmol/L required twice the volume of fluid infusion and \nsix times more blood transfusion in the first 24 hours com -\npared to patients with mild acidosis. Transfusion require -\nments increased as base deficit worsened and ICU and \nhospital lengths of stay increased. Mortality increased as base \ndeficit worsened; the frequency of organ failure increased \nwith greater base deficit. The probability of trauma patients \ndeveloping acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \nhas been reported to correlate with severity of admission \nbase deficit and lowest base deficit within the first 24 hours \npost injury. Persistently high base deficit is associated with \nabnormal O2 utilization and higher mortality. Monitoring \nbase deficit in the resuscitation of trauma patients assists in \nassessment of O2 transport and efficacy of resuscitation.

Upregulation of cytokine synthesis.\nC. Secretion of cytokines.\nD. All of the Above.Answer: D\nThe response in macrophages is initiated by genome-\nencoded pattern recognition receptors that respond to \ninvading microbes. With exposure to a foreign organism, \nthese receptors recognize microbial PAMPs and endoge -\nnous DAMPs. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a well-defined \nexample of a PAMP that plays an important role in pathogen \nsignaling.

This is termed source control . A \ndiscrete, walled-off purulent fluid collection (ie, an abscess) \nrequires drainage, either surgically or via percutaneous drain \ninsertion. An ongoing source of contamination (eg, bowel \nperforation) or the presence of an aggressive, rapidly spread -\ning infection (eg, necrotizing soft tissue infection) invariably \nrequires expedient, aggressive operative intervention, both to \nremove contaminated material and infected tissue (eg, radical \ndebridement or amputation) and to remove the initial cause \nof infection (eg, bowel resection).

Infection can be prevented with 24 hours of prophy -\nlactic antibiotics starting from the time of incision.\nC. Empiric antibiotics imply that the bacterial infection \nis a known/identified bacteria.\nD. Empiric therapy should continue for 3 days only.Answer: A\nProphylaxis consists of the administration of an antimi -\ncrobial agent or agents prior to initiation of certain specific \ntypes of surgical procedures in order to reduce the number \nof microbes that enter the tissue or body cavity. Agents are \nselected according to their activity against microbes likely to \nbe present at the surgical site, based on knowledge of host \nmicroflora. For example, patients undergoing elective colorec -\ntal surgery should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis directed \nagainst skin flora, gram-negative aerobes, and anaerobic \nbacteria. There are a wide variety of agents that meet these \ncriteria with recently published guidelines. By definition, pro -\nphylaxis is limited to the time prior to and during the opera -\ntive procedure; in the vast majority of cases only a single dose \nof antibiotic is required, and only for certain types of proce -\ndures.

All of the above.Answer: B\nThe SOFA score looks at PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilirubin, platelet \ncount, mean arterial pressure (MAP), Glasgow Coma Scale \n(GCS) score, creatinine level, and urine output. An increase \nin SOFA score of \u22652 is correlated with a 10% in-hospital mor -\ntality risk, which is suggestive of the life-threatening nature \nof sepsis. An abbreviated version of the scoring system, the \nquick SOFA (qSOFA) is recommended as a screening and \nmonitoring tool for patients with suspected sepsis. The \nqSOFA suggests potentially life-threatening sepsis when at \nleast two of the following parameters are met: altered mental \nstatus, systolic blood pressure of \u2264100 mm Hg, and respira -\ntory rate >22 breaths/minute. The qSOFA can readily identify \npatients at risk of poor outcome from sepsis without reliance \nupon laboratory or imaging data.

In primary bacterial peritonitis, infections are gener -\nally mixed gram-negative organisms.\nD. Primary bacterial peritonitis generally requires lapa -\nrotomy for source control.Answer: B\nPrimary microbial peritonitis occurs when microbes invade \nthe normally sterile confines of the peritoneal cavity via hema -\ntogenous dissemination from a distant source of infection \nor direct inoculation. This process is more common among \npatients who retain large amounts of peritoneal fluid due to \nascites, and among those individuals who are being treated for \nrenal failure via peritoneal dialysis.

Operative exploration, open drainage of the abscess, \nand antibiotic therapy.Answer: C\nHepatic abscesses are rare, currently accounting for approxi -\nmately 15 per 100,000 hospital admissions in the United \nStates. Pyogenic abscesses account for approximately 80% \nof cases, the remaining 20% being equally divided among \nparasitic and fungal forms. Formerly, pyogenic liver abscesses \nmainly were caused by pylephlebitis due to neglected appen -\ndicitis or diverticulitis. Today, manipulation of the biliary \ntract to treat a variety of diseases has become a more com -\nmon cause, although in nearly 50% of patients no cause is \nidentified. The most common aerobic bacteria identified in \nrecent series include Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , \nand other enteric bacilli, enterococci, and Pseudomonas  spp., \nwhile the most common anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides  \nspp., anaerobic streptococci, and Fusobacterium  spp. Can-\ndida albicans  and other related yeast cause the majority of \nfungal hepatic abscesses. Small (<1 cm), multiple abscesses \nshould be sampled and treated with a 4- to 6-week course of are associated with a higher rate of SSI. There is conflict -\ning evidence regarding whether supplying higher levels of \ninhaled oxygen to perioperative patients reduces the rate of \nSSI. Although an initial study provided evidence that patients \nwho received high levels of inhaled oxygen during colorec -\ntal surgery developed fewer SSIs, a later meta-analysis sug -\ngested that the overall benefit is small and may not warrant \nuse. The 2017 CDC guidelines, however, support administra -\ntion of increased FiO2 during surgery and after extubation \nin patients with normal pulmonary function receiving gen -\neral anesthesia as there has been some evidence of benefit. \nFurther evaluation via multicenter studies is needed prior to \nimplementation of hyperoxia as standard therapy, but it is \nclear that intraoperative hypothermia and hypoxia should be \nprevented.

Enteral feeding is contraindicated until resolution.\nB. Pancreatic necrosis is an indication for early opera -\ntive debridement.\nC. Open necrosectomy with repeated debridements \nshould occur in the first 2 weeks after illness.\nD. Early enteral feeding via a nasal-jejunal tube passed \nbeyond the ligament of Treitz is associated with \ndecreased development of infected pancreatic \nnecrosis.Answer: C\nSecondary pancreatic infections (eg, infected pancreatic \nnecrosis or pancreatic abscess) occur in approximately 10% to \n15% of patients who develop severe pancreatitis with necro -\nsis. The surgical treatment of this disorder was pioneered \nby Bradley and Allen, who noted significant improvements \nin outcome for patients undergoing repeated pancreatic \ndebridement of infected pancreatic necrosis. Care of patients \nwith severe acute pancreatitis includes staging with dynamic, \ncontrast-enhanced helical CT scan to evaluate the extent of \npancreatitis (unless significant renal dysfunction exists, in \nwhich case one should forego the use of contrast material) \ncoupled with the use of one of several prognostic scoring sys -\ntems. Patients who exhibit clinical signs of instability (eg, oli -\nguria, hypoxemia, large-volume fluid resuscitation) should be \ncarefully monitored in the ICU and undergo follow-up con -\ntrast CT examination when renal function has stabilized to \nevaluate for development of local pancreatic complications. \nRoutine use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infected \npancreatic necrosis is not indicated. Early enteral feeding \nusing nasojejunal feeding tubes placed past the ligament of \nTreitz has been associated with decreased development of \ninfected pancreatic necrosis, possibly due to a decrease in gut \ntranslocation of bacteria (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 172.)\n 13.

Is a clinical diagnosis, suspected in patients with \nsepsis, skin changes or creptus, and pain.Answer: C\nInitially, the diagnosis is established solely upon a con -\nstellation of clinical findings, not all of which are present \nin every patient. Not surprisingly, patients often develop \nsepsis syndrome or septic shock without an obvious cause. \nThe extremities, perineum, trunk, and torso are most com -\nmonly affected, in that order. Careful examination should be \nundertaken for an entry site such as a small break or sinus \nin the skin from which grayish, turbid semipurulent material \n(\u201cdishwater pus\u201d) can be expressed, as well as for the presence \nof skin changes (bronze hue or brawny induration), blebs, or \ncrepitus. The patient often develops pain at the site of infec -\ntion that appears to be out of proportion to any of the physical \nmanifestations. Any of these findings mandates immediate \nsurgical intervention, which should consist of incision and \ndirect visualization of potentially infected tissue (including \ndeep soft tissue, fascia, and underlying muscle) and radical \nresection of affected areas.

Single lumen and multilumen have similar infection \nrates.\nC. Are always associated with purulence at the insertion \nsite.\nD. Can be asymptomatic, with rising white blood cells \n(WBCs) and positive blood culture.Answer: D\nInfection associated with indwelling intravascular catheters \nis a common problem among hospitalized patients. Because \nof the complexity of many surgical procedures, these devices \nare increasingly used for physiologic monitoring, vascular \naccess, drug delivery, and hyperalimentation. Among the sev -\neral million catheters inserted each year in the United States, \napproximately 25% will become colonized, and approxi -\nmately 5% will be associated with bacteremia. Duration of \ncatheterization, insertion or manipulation under emergency \nor nonsterile conditions, use for hyperalimentation, and the \nuse of multilumen catheters increase the risk of infection. Use \nof a central line insertion protocol that includes full barrier \nprecautions and chlorhexidine skin prep has been shown to \ndecrease the incidence of infection.

Postexposure prophylaxis is most effective if initiated \nwithin hours.\nD. Is decreased where patients have low viral load.Answer: A\nThe risk of HIV transmission from patient to surgeon is low. \nAs of May 2011, there had been six cases of surgeons with HIV \nseroconversion from a possible occupational exposure, with \nno new cases reported since 1999. Of the numbers of health \ncare workers with likely occupationally acquired HIV infec -\ntion ( n = 200), surgeons were one of the lower risk groups \n(compared to nurses at 60 cases and nonsurgeon physicians \nat 19 cases). The estimated risk of transmission from a needle -\nstick from a source with HIV-infected blood is estimated urine is appropriate. Initial therapy is directed by Gram\u2019s stain \nresults and is refined as culture results become available. Post -\noperative surgical patients should have indwelling urinary \ncatheters removed as quickly as possible, typically within 1 to \n2 days, as long as they are mobile, to avoid the development of \na urinary tract infections (UTI).\nBrunicardi_Ch06_p037-048.indd   43 30/06/22   10:38 AM"

Possible exposure to anthrax should be initially treated \nwith:\nA. Colistin.\nB. Ciprofloxacin or doxycycline.\nC. Amoxcillin.\nD. Observation.Answer: B\nInhalational anthrax develops after a 1- to 6-day incubation \nperiod, with nonspecific symptoms including malaise, myal -\ngia, and fever. Over a short period of time, these symptoms \nworsen, with development of respiratory distress, chest pain, \nand diaphoresis. Characteristic chest roentgenographic find -\nings include a widened mediastinum and pleural effusions. A \nkey aspect in establishing the diagnosis is eliciting an exposure \nhistory. Rapid antigen tests are currently under development \nfor identification of this gram-positive rod. Postexposure \nprophylaxis consists of administration of either ciprofloxacin \nor doxycycline. If an isolate is demonstrated to be penicillin-\nsensitive, the patient should be switched to amoxicillin. Inha -\nlational exposure followed by the development of symptoms \nis associated with a high mortality rate. Treatment options \ninclude combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, clindamy -\ncin, and rifampin; clindamycin added to blocks production \nof toxin, while rifampin penetrates into the central nervous \nsystem and intracellular locations (Schwartz 11th ed., p. 178.)\n 20.

What is an appropriate next step?\nA. Exchange endotracheal tube and change respiratory \ncircuit.\nB. Obtain bronchoalveolar lavage.\nC. Start treatment with empiric penicillin G.\nD. Obtain chest CT.Answer: B\nProlonged mechanical ventilation is associated with noso -\ncomial pneumonia. These patients present with more severe \ndisease, are more likely to be infected with drug-resistant \npathogens, and suffer increased mortality compared to \npatients who develop community-acquired pneumonia.

Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalospo -\nrins is 5%\u20137%.Answer: B\nAllergy  to antimicrobial agents must be considered prior to \nprescribing them. First, it is important to ascertain whether \na patient has had any type of allergic reaction in association \nwith administration of a particular antibiotic. However, one \nshould take care to ensure that the purported reaction con -\nsists of true allergic symptoms and signs, such as urticaria, \nbronchospasm, or other similar manifestations, rather than \nindigestion or nausea. Penicillin allergy is quite common, \nthe reported incidence ranging from 0.7% to 10%. Although \navoiding the use of any \u03b2-lactam drug is appropriate in \npatients who manifest significant allergic reactions to peni -\ncillins, the incidence of cross-reactivity appears low for all \nrelated agents, with 1% cross-reactivity for carbapenems, 5% \nto 7% cross-reactivity for cephalosporins, and extremely small \nor nonexistent cross-reactivity for monobactams.

Avoids development of multidrug resistance among \nnosocomial pathogens.\nC. Clostridium difficile  colitis.\nD. Improved outcomes.Answer: C\nMisuse  of antimicrobial agents is rampant in both the inpa -\ntient and outpatient settings, and is associated with an enor -\nmous financial impact on health care costs, adverse reactions \ndue to drug toxicity and allergy, the occurrence of new infec -\ntions such as Clostridium difficile  colitis, and the development \nof multiagent drug resistance among nosocomial pathogens. \nEach of these factors has been directly correlated with overall \ndrug administration. It has been estimated that in the United \nStates in excess of $20 billion is spent on antibiotics each year. \nThe responsible practitioner limits prophylaxis to the period \nduring the operative procedure, does not convert prophylaxis \ninto empiric therapy except under well-defined conditions, \nsets the duration of antibiotic therapy from the outset, cur -\ntails antibiotic administration when clinical and microbio -\nlogic evidence does not support the presence of an infection, \nand limits therapy to a short course in every possible instance. two of the clinical findings, plus chest X-ray findings, sig -\nnificantly increases the likelihood of pneumonia. Consider -\nation should be given to perform bronchoalveolar lavage to \nobtain samples for Gram\u2019s stain and culture. Some authors \nadvocate quantitative cultures as a means to identify a thresh -\nold for diagnosis. Surgical patients should be weaned from \nmechanical ventilation as soon as feasible, based on oxygen -\nation and inspiratory effort, as prolonged mechanical ventila -\ntion increases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia.

Not surprisingly, patients often \ndevelop sepsis syndrome or septic shock without an obvious \ncause. The extremities, perineum, trunk, and torso are most \ncommonly affected, in that order. Careful examination should \nbe undertaken for an entry site such as a small break or sinus \nin the skin from which grayish, turbid semipurulent material \n(\u201cdishwater pus\u201d) can be expressed, as well as for the presence \nof skin changes (bronze hue or brawny induration), blebs, or \ncrepitus.

In healthy individuals, class I and II wounds \nmay be closed primarily, while skin closure of class III and \nIV wounds is associated with high rates of incisional SSIs \n(~25% to 50%). The superficial aspects of these latter types \nof wounds should be packed open and allowed to heal by sec -\nondary intention, although selective use of delayed primary \nclosure has been associated with a reduction in incisional \nSSI rates. It remains to be determined whether National \nNosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS)-type \nstratification schemes can be employed prospectively in \norder to target specific subgroups of patients who will ben -\nefit from the use of prophylactic antibiotic and/or specific \nwound management techniques. One clear example based \non cogent data from clinical trials is that class III wounds \nin healthy patients undergoing appendectomy for perforated \nor gangrenous appendicitis can be primarily closed as long \nas antibiotic therapy directed against aerobes and anaerobes \nis administered.

Chest X-ray demonstrates clear lung fields. \nWhat is the most appropriate next step?\nA. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest\nB. Pelvic X-ray\nC. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) \nexamination\nD. Tube thoracostomy of the left chestAnswer: C\nDuring the circulation section of the primary survey, four life-\nthreatening injuries must be identified promptly: (1) massive  \nhemothorax, (2) cardiac tamponade, (3) massive hemoperi -\ntoneum, and (4) mechanically unstable pelvic fractures with \nbleeding. In this patient, hemothorax is unlikely given normal \nchest X-ray; thus, hemoperitoneum and cardiac tamponade \nshould be suspected. Cardiac tamponade occurs most com -\nmonly after penetrating thoracic wounds, although occa -\nsionally blunt rupture of the heart, particularly the atrial \nappendage, is seen. Acutely, <100 mL of pericardial blood \nmay cause pericardial tamponade. The classic Beck\u2019s triad\u2014\ndilated neck veins, muffled heart tones, and a decline in \narterial pressure\u2014is usually not appreciated in the trauma \nbay because of the noisy environment and associated hypo -\nvolemia. Diagnosis is best achieved by bedside ultrasound of \nthe pericardium, which is one of the four views of the FAST \nexamination.

His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is 7. \nHis pulse is barely palpable at a rate of 140 beats per \nminute, and BP is 60/0. Breathing is rapid and shallow, \naerating both lung fields. His abdomen is moderately \ndistended with no audible peristalsis. There are closed \nfractures of the right forearm and the left lower leg. After \nrapid intravenous (IV) administration of 2 L of lactated \nRinger solution in the upper extremities, his pulse is 130 \nand BP 70/0. The next immediate step should be to:\nA. Obtain cross-table lateral X-rays of the cervical spine.\nB. Obtain head and abdominal CT scans.\nC. Obtain supine and lateral decubitus X-rays of the \nabdomen.\nD. Obtain an arch aortogram.\nE. Intubate and proceed to the operating room (OR) to \nexplore the abdomen.Answer: E\nIdeally, a patient seriously injured in an automobile accident \nshould undergo X-rays of the cervical spine, the chest, and \nthe abdomen. When he has a GCS of 7, CT scans of the head \nare certainly desirable. If the chest X-ray shows a widened \nmediastinum, arch aortograms are indicated. However, this \npatient has had no response to a rapid fluid challenge, and \nif he is to survive, bleeding must be controlled immediately. \nThe head injury, although severe, is not responsible for his \nhypotension and tachycardia. The most likely problem is \nuncontrolled abdominal hemorrhage. Immediate abdominal \nexploration offers the best chance for survival. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 193.)\n 5. After sustaining a gunshot wound to the right upper \nquadrant of the abdomen, the patient has no signs \nof peritonitis. Her vital signs are stable, and CT scan \nshows a grade III liver injury. What is the next step in \nmanagement?\nA. Exploratory laparotomy with control of hepatic \nparenchymal hemorrhage\nB. Admission to surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with \nserial complete blood count\nC. Admission to SICU with repeat CT in 24 hours\nD. Hepatic angiographyAnswer: B\nThe liver\u2019s large size makes it the organ most susceptible to \nblunt trauma, and it is frequently involved in upper torso pen -\netrating wounds. Nonoperative management of solid organ \ninjuries is pursued in hemodynamically stable patients who do \nnot have overt peritonitis or other indications for laparotomy. \nPatients with more than grade II injuries should be admitted \nto the SICU with frequent hemodynamic monitoring, deter -\nmination of hemoglobin, and abdominal examination. The \nonly absolute contraindication to nonoperative management \nis hemodynamic instability. Factors such as high injury grade, \nlarge hemoperitoneum, contrast extravasation, or pseudoan -\neurysms may predict complications or failure of nonoperative \nmanagement. Angioembolization and endoscopic retrograde \ncholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are useful adjuncts that \ncan improve the success rate of nonoperative management. \nThe indication for angiography to control hepatic hemor -\nrhage is transfusion of 4 units of RBCs in 6 hours or 6 units \nof RBCs in 24 hours without hemodynamic instability. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 225.) 3. After an automobile accident, a 30-year-old woman is \ndiscovered to have a posterior pelvic fracture. Hypo -\ntension and tachycardia respond marginally to volume \nreplacement. Once it is evident that her major problem \nis free intraperitoneal bleeding and a pelvic hematoma in \nassociation with the fracture, appropriate management \nwould be:\nA. Application of medical antishock trousers with infla -\ntion of the extremity and abdominal sections.\nB. Arterial embolization of the pelvic vessels.\nC. Celiotomy and ligation of the internal iliac arteries \nbilaterally.\nD. Celiotomy and pelvic packing.\nE. External fixation application to stabilize the pelvis.Answer: D\nSevere pelvic bleeding is a major problem in the trauma \npatient. Neither external fixation nor the use of medical anti -\nshock trousers control free intra-abdominal hemorrhage \nregardless of its source. In the unstable patient, celiotomy is \nmandatory. If there is a ruptured retroperitoneal hematoma \nbleeding into the peritoneal cavity, control is a major prob -\nlem. Internal iliac artery ligation has been abandoned as it \nis rarely effective. Angiography and arterial embolization \nmay be effective with an arterial bleeding problem, but most \nsevere pelvic hemorrhage is venous in origin. If the hema -\ntoma is stable, it is best to leave it undisturbed. However, if \nthe hematoma has ruptured into the peritoneal cavity, pelvic \npacking offers the best hope of control.

At what pressure is operative decompression of an \nextremity compartment mandatory?\nA. 15 mm Hg\nB. 25 mm Hg\nC. 35 mm Hg\nD. 45 mm HgAnswer: D\nIn comatose or obtunded patients, the diagnosis is more dif -\nficult to secure. A compatible history, firmness of the com -\npartment to palpation, and diminished mobility of the joint \nare suggestive. The presence or absence of a pulse distal to \nthe affected compartment is notoriously unreliable in the \ndiagnosis of a compartment syndrome. A frozen joint and \nmyoglobinuria are late signs and suggest a poor prognosis. \nAs in the abdomen, compartment pressure can be measured. \nThe small, hand held Stryker device is a convenient tool for \nthis purpose. Pressures >45 mm Hg usually require operative \nintervention. Patients with pressures between 30 and 45 mm \nHg should be carefully evaluated and closely watched.

Nonabsorbable monofilament suture.\nD. Absorbable braided suture.Answer: B\nInjuries of the trachea are repaired with a running 3-0 absorb -\nable monofilament suture. Tracheostomy is not required in \nmost patients. Esophageal injuries are repaired in a similar \nfashion. If an esophageal wound is large or if tissue is miss -\ning, a sternocleidomastoid muscle pedicle flap is warranted, \nand a closed suction drain is a reasonable precaution. The \ndrain should be near but not in contact with the esophageal or \nany other suture line. It can be removed in 7 to 10 days if the \nsuture line remains secure. Care must be taken when explor -\ning the trachea and esophagus to avoid iatrogenic injury \nto the recurrent laryngeal nerve. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \nCh. 7, p. 224.) 6. Which of the following statements is correct regarding \ntraumatic spleen injury?\nA. An elevation in WBC to 20,000/mm3 and platelets to \n300,000/mm3 on postoperative day 7 is a common \nbenign finding in postsplenectomy patients.\nB. Delayed rebleeding or rupture will typically occur \nwithin 48 hours of injury.\nC. Common complications after splenectomy include \nsubdiaphragmatic abscess, pancreatic tail injury, and \ngastric perforation.\nD. Postsplenectomy vaccines against encapsulated bac -\nteria are optimally administered preoperatively or \nimmediately postoperative.Answer: C\nAfter splenectomy or splenorrhaphy, postoperative hemor -\nrhage may be due to an improperly ligated or unrecognized \nshort gastric artery, or recurrent bleeding from the splenic \nparenchyma if splenic repair was used. An immediate post -\nsplenectomy increase in platelets and WBCs is normal; \nhowever, beyond postoperative day 5, a WBC count above \n15,000/mm3 and a platelet/WBC ratio of <20 are associated \nwith sepsis and should prompt a thorough search for underly -\ning infection. A common infectious complication after sple -\nnectomy is a subphrenic abscess, which should be managed \nwith percutaneous drainage. Additional sources of morbidity \ninclude a concurrent or unrecognized iatrogenic injury to the \npancreatic tail during rapid splenectomy resulting in pancre -\natic ascites or fistula, or gastric perforation during short gas -\ntric vessel ligation. Enthusiasm for splenic salvage was driven \nby the rare, but often fatal, complication of overwhelming \npostsplenectomy sepsis. Overwhelming postsplenectomy \nsepsis is caused by encapsulated bacteria, Streptococcus pneu -\nmoniae, Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria meningitidis , \nwhich are resistant to antimicrobial treatment. In patients \nundergoing splenectomy, prophylaxis against these bacteria \nis provided via vaccines administered optimally at >14 days \npostinjury.

All patients with neck injury should receive com -\nputed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the neck.\nD. Patients with dysphagia, hoarseness, hematoma, \nvenous bleeding, hemoptysis, or subcutaneous \nemphysema should undergo neck exploration.Answer: A\nZone I is inferior to the clavicles encompassing the thoracic \noutlet structures, zone II is between the thoracic outlet and \nthe angle of the mandible, and zone III is above the angle \nof the mandible. Patients with symptomatic zone I and III \ninjuries should ideally undergo diagnostic imaging before \noperation if they remain hemodynamically stable. Specific \nsymptoms which indicate further imaging include dysphagia, \nhoarseness, hematoma, venous bleeding, minor hemoptysis, \nand subcutaneous emphysema. Symptomatic patients should \nundergo CTA with further evaluation or operation based \nupon the imaging findings; <15% of penetrating cervical \ntrauma requires neck exploration. Asymptomatic patients are \ntypically observed for 6 to 12 hours. The one caveat is asymp -\ntomatic patients with a transcervical gunshot wound; these \npatients should undergo CTA to determine the track of the \nbullet.

There is documented lung injury on CT scan.Answer: B\nThe most common injuries from both blunt and penetrating \nthoracic trauma are hemothorax and pneumothorax. More than \n85% of patients can be definitively treated with a chest tube. \nThe indications for thoracotomy include significant initial or \nongoing hemorrhage from the tube thoracostomy and specific  \nimaging-identified diagnoses. One caveat concerns the patient \nwho presents after a delay. Even when the initial chest tube out -\nput is 1.5 L, if the output ceases and the lung is re-expanded, the \npatient may be managed nonoperatively, if hemodynamically \nstable.

Should be targeted to be >100 mm Hg.\nC. Is lowered with sedation, osmotic diuresis, paralysis, \nventricular drainage, and barbiturate coma.\nD. Can be increased by lowering ICP and avoiding \nhypotension.Answer: D\nThe goal of resuscitation and management in patients with \nhead injuries is to avoid hypotension (SBP of <100 mm Hg) \nand hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen of <60 or \narterial oxygen saturation of <90). Attention, therefore, is \nfocused on maintaining cerebral perfusion rather than merely \nlowering ICP . Resuscitation efforts aim for a euvolemic state \nand an SBP of >100 mm Hg. CPP is equal to the mean arterial \npressure minus the ICP , with a target range of >50 mm Hg. \nCPP can be increased by either lowering ICP or raising mean \narterial pressure. Sedation, osmotic diuresis, paralysis, ven -\ntricular drainage, and barbiturate coma are used in sequence, \nwith coma induction being the last resort.

Which of \nthe following would be the most appropriate next step in \nmanagement?\nA. Nonoperative treatment\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography \n(ERCP) with stenting of pancreatic duct\nC. Distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation\nD. Primary repair of pancreatic duct with closed suction \ndrainageAnswer: C\nOptimal management of pancreatic trauma is determined by \nwhere the parenchymal damage is located and whether the \nintrapancreatic common bile duct and main pancreatic duct \nremain intact. Patients with pancreatic contusions (defined \nas injuries that leave the ductal system intact) can be treated \nnonoperatively or with closed suction drainage if undergo -\ning laparotomy for other indications. Patients with proximal \npancreatic injuries, defined as those that lie to the right of \nthe superior mesenteric vessels, are also managed with closed \nsuction drainage. In contrast, distal pancreatic injuries are \nmanaged based upon ductal integrity. Pancreatic duct dis -\nruption can be identified through direct exploration of the \nparenchymal laceration, operative pancreatography, ERCP , \nor MRCP . Patients with distal ductal disruption undergo  11. The most appropriate treatment for a duodenal hema -\ntoma that occurs from blunt trauma is:\nA. Exploratory laparotomy and bypass of the duodenum.\nB. Exploratory laparotomy and evacuation of the \nhematoma.\nC. Exploratory laparotomy to rule out associated \ninjuries.\nD. Observation.Answer: D\nThe spectrum of injuries to the duodenum includes hema -\ntomas, perforation (blunt blow-outs, lacerations from stab \nwounds, or blast injury from gunshot wounds), and com -\nbined pancreaticoduodenal injuries. The majority of duode -\nnal hematomas are managed nonoperatively with nasogastric \nsuction and parenteral nutrition. Patients with suspected \nassociated perforation, suggested by clinical deterioration or \nimaging with retroperitoneal free air or contrast extravasa -\ntion, should undergo operative exploration. A marked drop in \nnasogastric tube output heralds resolution of the hematoma, \nwhich typically occurs within 2 weeks; repeat imaging to con -\nfirm these clinical findings is optional. If the patient shows \nno clinical or radiographic improvement within 3 weeks,  \noperative evaluation is warranted.

End colostomy and mucous fistula.\nB. Loop colostomy.\nC. Exteriorized repair.\nD. Resection of the right colon with ileocolostomy.Answer: D\nNumerous large retrospective and several prospective stud -\nies have now clearly demonstrated that primary repair is safe \nand effective in the majority of patients with penetrating inju -\nries. Colostomy is still appropriate in a few patients, but the \ncurrent dilemma is how to select them. Exteriorized repair is \nprobably no longer indicated since most patients who were \nonce candidates for this treatment are now successfully man -\naged by primary repair. Two methods have been advocated \nthat result in 75% to 90% of penetrating colonic injuries \nbeing safely treated by primary repair. The first is to repair all \nperforations not requiring resection. If resection is required \ndue to the local extent of the injury, and it is proximal to the \nmiddle colic artery, the proximal portion of the right colon up \nto and including the injury is resected and an ileocolostomy \nperformed. If resection is required distal to the middle colic \nartery, an end colostomy is created and the distal colon over -\nsewn and left within the abdomen. The theory behind this \napproach is that an ileocolostomy heals more reliably than \ncolocolostomy, because in the trauma patient who has suf -\nfered shock and may be hypovolemic, assessing the adequacy \nof the blood supply of the colon is much less reliable than in \nelective procedures. The blood supply of the terminal ileum \nis never a problem. The other approach is to repair all inju -\nries regardless of the extent and location (including coloco -\nlostomy), and reserve colostomy for patients with protracted \nshock and extensive contamination. The theory used to sup -\nport this approach is that systemic factors are more impor -\ntant than local factors in determining whether a suture line \nwill heal. Both of these approaches are reasonable and result \nin the majority of patients being treated by primary repairs. \nWhen a colostomy is required, regardless of the theory used \nto reach that conclusion, performing a loop colostomy proxi -\nmal to a distal repair should be avoided because a proximal \ncolostomy does not protect a distal suture line. All suture lines \nand anastomoses are performed with the running single-layer \ntechnique. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 230.)\n 16. Which of the following statements is true of vascular \ninjuries of the extremities?\nA. In the absence of hard signs of vascular injury, if the \ndifference between systolic blood pressure (SBP) in \nan injured limb is within 15% of the uninjured limb, \nno further evaluation is needed.\nB. Occult profunda femoris injuries can result in com -\npartment syndrome and limb loss.\nC. All patients with significant hematoma should be \nsurgically explored.\nD. Vascular injury repair should be performed prior to \nrealignment of bony fractures or dislocations.Answer: B\nPhysical examination often identifies arterial injuries, and \nfindings are classified as either hard signs or soft signs of \nvascular injury (Table 7-2). In general, hard signs constitute \nindications for operative exploration, whereas soft signs are \nindications for further testing or observation. Bony fractures \nor knee dislocations should be realigned before definitive vas -\ncular examination. In management of vascular trauma, con -\ntroversy exists regarding the treatment of patients with soft \nsigns of injury, particularly those with injuries in proximity \nto major vessels. It is known that some of these patients will \nhave arterial injuries that require repair. The most common distal pancreatectomy, preferably with splenic preservation. \nAn alternative, which preserves both the spleen and distal \ntransected end of the pancreas, is either a Roux-en-Y pan -\ncreaticojejunostomy or pancreaticogastrostomy. If the patient \nis physiologically compromised, distal pancreatectomy with \nsplenectomy is the preferred approach.

Iatrogenic increased afterload due to pressorsAnswer: C\nIn trauma patients, the differential diagnosis of cardiogenic \nshock consists of a short list: (1) tension pneumothorax,  \n(2) pericardial tamponade, (3) myocardial contusion or \ninfarction, and (4) air embolism.\nTension pneumothorax is the most frequent cause of car -\ndiac failure. Traumatic pericardial tamponade is most often \nassociated with penetrating injury to the heart. As blood \nleaks out of the injured heart, it accumulates in the pericar -\ndial sac. Because the pericardium is not acutely distensible, \nthe pressure in the pericardial sac rises to match that of the \ninjured chamber. Since this pressure is usually greater than \nthat of the right atrium, right atrial filling is impaired and \nright ventricular preload is reduced. This leads to decreased \nright ventricular output and increased central venous pres -\nsure (CVP). Increased intrapericardial pressure also impedes \nmyocardial blood flow, which leads to subendocardial isch -\nemia and a further reduction in cardiac output. This vicious \ncycle may progress insidiously with injury of the vena cava \nor atria, or precipitously with injury of either ventricle. With \nacute tamponade, as little as 100 mL of blood within the peri -\ncardial sac can produce life-threatening hemodynamic com -\npromise. Patients usually present with a penetrating injury in \nproximity to the heart, and they are hypotensive and have dis -\ntended neck veins or an elevated CVP . The classic findings of \nBeck\u2019s triad (hypotension, distended neck, and muffled heart \nsounds) and pulsus paradoxus are not reliable indicators of \nacute tamponade. Ultrasonography (US) in the emergency \ndepartment (ED) using a subxiphoid or parasternal view is \nextremely helpful if the findings are clearly positive (Fig. 7-1); approach has been to measure SBP using Doppler ultraso -\nnography and compare the value for the injured side with that \nfor the uninjured side, termed the A-A index.  If the pressures \nare within 10% of each other, a significant injury is unlikely \nand no further evaluation is performed. If the difference is \n>10%, computed tomography angiogram (CTA) or arteriog -\nraphy is indicated. Others argue that there are occult injuries, \nsuch as pseudoaneurysms or injuries of the profunda femo -\nris or peroneal arteries, which may not be detected with this \ntechnique. If hemorrhage occurs from these injuries, com -\npartment syndrome and limb loss may occur. Although busy \ntrauma centers continue to debate this issue, the surgeon who \nis obliged to treat the occasional injured patient may be bet -\nter served by performing CTA in selected patients with soft \nsigns.

Three of more ribs fractured in at least two locations\nC. Paradoxical movement of a free floating segment of \nchest wall\nD. High likelihood of associated pulmonary contusionAnswer: A\nFlail chest occurs when three or more contiguous ribs are \nfractured in at least two locations. Paradoxical movement \nof this free-floating segment of chest wall is usually evident \nin patients with spontaneous ventilation, due to the negative \nintrapleural pressure of inspiration. The additional work of \nbreathing and chest wall pain caused by the flail segment is \nrarely sufficient to compromise ventilation. Instead, it is the \ndecreased compliance and increased shunt fraction caused by \nthe associated pulmonary contusion that is the source of acute \nrespiratory failure. Pulmonary contusions often progress dur -\ning the first 12 hours. Resultant hypoventilation and hypox -\nemia may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The \npatient\u2019s initial chest radiograph often underestimates the \nextent of the pulmonary parenchymal damage; close moni -\ntoring and frequent clinical reevaluation are warranted. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 186.)Patients who have an abnormal voice, abnormal breathing \nsounds, tachypnea, or altered mental status require further \nairway evaluation. Blood, vomit, the tongue, teeth, foreign \nobjects, and soft tissue swelling can cause airway obstruction; \nsuctioning affords immediate relief in many patients. In the \ncomatose patient, the tongue may fall backward and obstruct \nthe hypopharynx; this can be relieved by either a chin lift or \njaw thrust. An oral airway or a nasal trumpet is also helpful \nin maintaining airway patency, although the former is usually \nnot tolerated by an awake patient. Establishing a definitive \nairway (ie, endotracheal intubation) is indicated in patients \nwith apnea; inability to protect the airway due to altered \nmental status; impending airway compromise due to inhala -\ntion injury, hematoma, facial bleeding, soft tissue swelling, \nor aspiration; and inability to maintain oxygenation. Altered \nmental status is the most common indication for intubation. \nAgitation or obtundation, often attributed to intoxication or \ndrug use, may actually be due to hypoxia. But the timing of \nendotracheal intubation may be critical in the hypovolemic \npatient because positive airway pressure may further com -\npromise cardiac function and precipitate cardiac arrest; thus, \ncirculation may take priority over airway.

Head on impact\nB. Death of another occupant in the vehicle\nC. Extrication time >20 minutes\nD. Change in velocity of >20 MPH\nE. Lack of restraint useAnswer: A\nPatients who have sustained blunt trauma can be separated \ninto categories according to their risk for multiple injuries: \nthose sustaining high-energy transfer injuries and those sus -\ntaining low-energy transfer injuries. Injuries involving high-\nenergy transfer include auto-pedestrian accidents, motor \nvehicle collisions in which the car\u2019s change of velocity (\u0394 V) \nexceeds 20 mph or in which the patient has been ejected, \nmotorcycle collisions, and falls from heights >20 ft.

Low-\nenergy trauma, such as being struck with a club or falling from \na bicycle, usually does not result in widely distributed inju -\nries.

Critical tools used to differentiate these in the mul -\ntisystem trauma patient are the chest and pelvis radiographs, \nand extended focused abdominal sonography for trauma \n(eFAST).

Patients with gunshot or stab \nwounds to the left lower chest should be evaluated with diag -\nnostic laparoscopy or DPL to exclude diaphragmatic injury. \nIn general, penetrating right diaphragm injury is ignored \nunless there is a major underlying liver injury with a risk of \nbiliopleural fistula. Diagnostic laparoscopy may be preferred \nin patients with a positive chest radiograph (hemothorax or \npneumothorax) or in those who would not tolerate a DPL.

Which of the following describes a type I tracheobron -\nchial injury?\nA. Occurring within 3 cm of the mainstem bronchus\nB. Likely to cause a pneumothorax\nC. A distal bronchial injury\nD. Occurring within 2 cm of the carinaAnswer: D\nMajor air leak occurs from tracheobronchial injuries. Type I  \ninjuries are those occurring within 2 cm of the carina. These \nmay not be associated with a pneumothorax due to the envel -\nopment in the mediastinal pleura. Type II injuries are more \ndistal injuries within the tracheobronchial tree and hence \nmanifest with a pneumothorax.

Celiac axis.\nC. Proximal superior mesenteric artery (SMA).\nD. Left renal artery.Answer: A\nSupracolic injuries (aorta, celiac axis, proximal SMA, and left \nrenal arteries) are best approached via a left medial visceral \nrotation. This is done by incising the lateral peritoneal reflec -\ntion (white line of Toldt) beginning at the distal descending \ncolon and extending the incision along the colonic splenic \nflexure, around the posterior aspect of the spleen, and behind \nthe gastric fundus, ending at the esophagus. The left colon, \nspleen, pancreas, and stomach are then rotated toward the \nmidline. The authors prefer to leave the kidney in situ when \nmobilizing the viscera because this exaggerates the separation \nof the renal vessels from the SMA. The operative approach \nfor SMA injuries is based on the level of injury. Fullen zone \nI SMA injuries, located posterior to the pancreas, are best \nexposed by a left medial visceral rotation. Fullen zone II SMA \ninjuries, extending from the pancreatic edge to the middle \ncolic branch, on the other hand, are approached via the lesser \nsac along the inferior edge of the pancreas at the base of the \ntransverse mesocolon; the pancreatic body may be divided \nto gain proximal vascular access. More distal SMA injuries, \nFullen zones III and IV , are approached directly within the \nmesentery. A venous injury behind the pancreas, from the \njunction of the superior mesenteric, splenic, and portal veins, \nis accessed by dividing the neck of the pancreas. IVC injuries \nare approached by a right medial visceral rotation. Proximal \ncontrol is obtained just above the iliac bifurcation with direct \npressure via a sponge stick; the injury is identified by cepha -\nlad dissection along the anterior surface of the IVC. A Satin -\nsky clamp can be used to control anterior caval wounds. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 212.)\n 30.

Alkaline phosphatase >250 IU/L\nC. Transfusion of 4U RBC in 6 hours, or 6U over 24 hours\nD. Persistent right upper quadrant painAnswer: C\nNonoperative management of solid organ injuries is pursued \nin hemodynamically stable patients who do not have overt \nperitonitis or other indications for laparotomy. Patients with \n>grade II injuries should be admitted to the surgical intensive \ncare unit (SICU) with frequent hemodynamic monitoring, \ndetermination of hemoglobin, and abdominal examination. \nThe only absolute contraindication to nonoperative man -\nagement is hemodynamic instability from intraperitoneal \nhemorrhage. Factors such as high injury grade, large hemo -\nperitoneum, contrast extravasation, or pseudoaneurysms may \npredict complications or failure of nonoperative management. \nAngioembolization and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan -\ncreatography (ERCP) are useful adjuncts that can improve the \nsuccess rate of nonoperative management. The indication for \nangiography to control hepatic hemorrhage is transfusion of \n4 units of RBCs in 6 hours or 6 units of RBCs in 24 hours \nattributable to the liver.

Increased resting heart rate by 10 to 15 beats per \nminute\nB. Increased resting blood pressure during the first  \n2 trimesters\nC. Decreased maternal intravascular volume\nD. Decreased tidal volume and minute ventilationAnswer: A\nPregnancy results in physiologic changes that may impact \npostinjury evaluation. Heart rate increases by 10 to 15 beats \nper minute during the first trimester and remains elevated \nuntil delivery. Blood pressure diminishes during the first 2 tri -\nmesters due to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and \nrises again slightly during the third trimester (mean values: \nfirst = 105/60, second = 102/55, third = 108/67). Intravascu -\nlar volume is increased by up to 8 L, which results in a rela -\ntive anemia but also a relative hypervolemia. Consequently, \na pregnant woman may lose 35% of her blood volume before \nexhibiting signs of shock. Pregnant patients have an increase \nin tidal volume and minute ventilation but a decreased func -\ntional residual capacity; this results in a diminished PCO2 and \nrespiratory alkalosis. Also, pregnant patients may desaturate \nmore rapidly, particularly in the supine position and during \nintubation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., Ch. 7, p. 240.) 32. During the initial phases of shock resuscitation, what is \nan appropriate goal hemoglobin level?\nA. 8.0 g/dL\nB. 10 g/dL\nC. 7 g/dL\nD. 12 g/dLAnswer: B\nThe period of acute resuscitation, typically lasting for the first \n12 to 24 hours after injury, combines several key principles: \noptimizing tissue perfusion, ensuring normothermia, and \nrestoring coagulation status. There are a multitude of man -\nagement algorithms aimed at accomplishing these goals, the \nmajority of which involve goal-directed resuscitation with \ninitial volume loading to attain adequate preload, followed by \njudicious use of inotropic agents or vasopressors. Although \nthe optimal hemoglobin level remains debated, during shock \nresuscitation a hemoglobin level of >10 g/dL is generally \naccepted to optimize hemostasis and ensure adequate oxygen \ndelivery. After the first 24 hours of resuscitation, a more judi -\ncious transfusion trigger of a hemoglobin level of <7 g/dL in \nthe euvolemic patient limits the adverse inflammatory effects \nof stored RBCs.

Injury at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction\nD. Posterior wound of a through and through penetrat -\ning injuryAnswer: D\nThe most commonly missed gastric injury is the posterior \nwound of a through and through penetrating injury. Inju -\nries also can be overlooked if the wound is located within the \nmesentery of the lesser curvature or high in the fundus. To \ndelineate a questionable injury, the stomach can be digitally \noccluded at the pylorus while methylene blue-colored saline \nis instilled via a nasogastric (NG) tube. Alternatively, air can \nbe introduced via the NG tube with the abdomen filled with \nsaline. Little controversy exists regarding the repair of injuries \nto the stomach or small bowel because of a rich blood supply. \nGastric wounds can be oversewn with a running single-layer \nsuture line or closed with a stapler. If a single-layer closure is \nchosen, full-thickness bites should be taken to ensure hemosta -\nsis from the well-vascularized gastric wall. Partial gastrectomy \nmay be required for destructive injuries, with resections of the \ndistal antrum or pylorus reconstructed using a Billroth proce -\ndure. Patients with injuries that damage both Latarjet nerves \nor vagi should undergo a drainage procedure.

Admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score after \nsevere head injury is a good predictor of outcome.\nB. Rib fractures are associated with pulmonary contu -\nsion in 35% of patients, and complicated by pneumo -\nnia in 10% to 30% of patients.\nC. Approximately 10% of patients older than 65 years \nwill sustain a rib fracture from a fall <6 ft.\nD. Chronologic age older than 65 years is associated \nwith higher morbidity and mortality after trauma.Answer: B\nMortality in patients with severe head injury more than dou -\nbles after the age of 55 years. Moreover, 25% of patients with \na normal GCS score of 15 had intracranial bleeding, with an \nassociated mortality of 50%. Just as there is no absolute age \nthat predicts outcome, admission GCS score is a poor predic -\ntor of individual outcome.

With direct ther -\nmal injury to the upper airway or smoke inhalation, rapid \nand severe airway edema is potentially lethal. Anticipating \nthe need for intubation and establishing an early airway are \ncritical. Signs of impending respiratory compromise include \na hoarse voice, wheezing, or stridor; subjective dyspnea is a \nparticularly concerning symptom and should trigger prompt \nelective endotracheal intubation. Perioral burns and singed \nnasal hairs alone do not indicate an upper airway injury, \nbut are signs that the oral cavity and pharynx should be fur -\nther evaluated for mucosal injury. Orotracheal intubation is \nthe preferred method for securing the airway. Nasotracheal \nintubation may be useful for patients with associated facial \ntrauma when experienced providers are present, but it should \nbe avoided if oral intubation is safe and easy.

The \u201crule of nines\u201d is a \ncrude but quick and effective method of estimating burn size  \n(Fig. 8-1). In adults, the anterior and posterior trunk each \naccount for 18%, each lower extremity is 18%, each upper \nextremity is 9%, and the head is 9%. In children under 3 years \nof age, the head accounts for a larger relative surface area and \nshould be taken into account when estimating burn size. For \nsmaller or odd-shaped burns, the \u201crule of the palm\u201d where the \npalmar surface of the hand, including the digits, is 1% TBSA \nis useful. Diagrams such as the Lund and Browder chart give \na more accurate accounting of the true burn size in children \nand adults.

The most severely burned portion is typically in the \ncenter of the wound, which will require excision and \ngrafting.\nB. The most severely burned portion is typically in the \ncenter of the wound, which will likely heal without \nsurgical intervention if adequate perfusion is main -\ntained and infection is prevented.\nC. It has variable degrees of vasoconstriction and resul -\ntant ischemia, which will require excision and grafting.\nD. It is hyperemic and extremely painful to touch, but \nwill not require surgical excision or grafting.Answer: A\nThe zone of coagulation is the most severely burned por -\ntion and is typically in the center of the wound. As the name \nimplies, the affected tissue is coagulated and sometimes \nfrankly necrotic, much like a full-thickness burn, and will \nneed excision and grafting. Peripheral to that is a zone of \nstasis, with variable degrees of vasoconstriction and resul -\ntant ischemia, much like a second-degree burn. Appropri -\nate resuscitation and wound care may prevent conversion to \na deeper wound, but infection or suboptimal perfusion may \nresult in an increase in burn depth. This is clinically relevant \nbecause many superficial partial-thickness burns will heal \nwith nonoperative management, and the majority of deep \npartial-thickness burns benefit from excision and skin graft -\ning. The outermost area of a burn is called the zone of hyper -\nemia, which will heal with minimal or no scarring and is most \nlike a superficial partial-thickness burn or first-degree burn. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 253.) 4. In order to assess the special concerns associated with \nelectrical burns:\nA. All extremity compartments should be evaluated and \na baseline ECG should be obtained.\nB. A full neurologic assessment including ophthal -\nmologic is required to evaluate acute intraocular \npathology.\nC. A Foley catheter should be placed to allow for titra -\ntion of fluid administration.\nD. Workup should include an echocardiogram to evalu -\nate ventricular wall motion.Answer: A\nElectrical burns make up 3% of US hospital admissions but \nhave special concerns, including cardiac arrhythmia and com -\npartment syndrome with concurrent rhabdomyolysis. A base -\nline ECG is recommended in all patients with an electrical \ninjury, and a normal ECG in a low-voltage injury (<1000 V)  \nmay preclude hospital admission. Because compartment syn -\ndrome and rhabdomyolysis are common in high-voltage elec -\ntrical injuries, vigilance must be maintained for neurologic or \nvascular compromise, and fasciotomies should be performed \neven in cases of moderate clinical suspicion. For patients with \nrhabdomyolysis, a Foley catheter and monitoring of elec -\ntrolytes may be aid in renal function monitoring, but fluid \nadministration and urine output is not prioritized as highly in \nelectrical when compared to external burns. Long-term neuro -\nlogic symptoms and cataract development are not uncommon \nwith high-voltage electrical injuries, and neurologic and oph -\nthalmologic consultation should be obtained to define base -\nline patient function. However, acute intraocular pathology is \nunlikely to be uncovered. ( See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 252.)\n 6. Which of the following describes a partial-thickness, \nsecond-degree burn?\nA. Leathery, painless, and nonblanching\nB. Painful but do not blister\nC. Dermal involvement and are extremely painful with \nweeping and blisters\nD. Will need excision and graftingAnswer: C\nBased on the original burn depth classification by Dupuytren \nin 1832, burn wounds are commonly classified as superficial \n(first-degree), partial-thickness (second-degree), full-thickness \n(third-degree), and fourth-degree burns, which affect under -\nlying soft tissue. Fifth-degree burns (through muscle to bone) \nand sixth-degree burns (charring bone) were also described \nalthough are less common. Partial-thickness burns are clas -\nsified as either superficial or deep partial-thickness burns by \ndepth of involved dermis. Clinically, first-degree burns are \npainful but do not blister, second-degree burns have dermal \ninvolvement and are extremely painful with weeping and \nblisters, and third-degree burns are leathery, painless, and \nnonblanching. Jackson described three zones of tissue injury \nfollowing burn injury. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 253.)\nBrunicardi_Ch08_p065-072.indd   67 30/06/22   10:39 AM"

Increase the F IO2 and decrease in positive end-  \nexpiratory pressure (PEEP).\nD. Eschar release along the anterior axillary lines with \nbilateral subcostal and subclavicular extensions.Answer: D\nHypoventilation, increased airway pressures, and hypoten -\nsion may also characterize thoracic compartment syndrome. \nEscharotomies are rarely needed within the first 8 hours fol -\nlowing injury and should not be performed unless indicated \nbecause of the terrible aesthetic sequelae. When indicated, \nthey are usually performed at the bedside, preferably with \nelectrocautery to minimize blood loss. Extremity incisions \nare made on the lateral and medial aspects of the limbs in an \nanatomic position and may extend onto thenar and hypothe -\nnar eminences of the hand. Digital escharotomies do not usu -\nally result in any meaningful salvage of functional tissue and \nare not recommended. Inadequate perfusion despite proper \nescharotomies may indicate the need for fasciotomy, but this \nprocedure should not be routinely performed as part of the \neschar release. Thoracic escharotomies should be placed along \nthe anterior axillary lines with bilateral subcostal and subcla -\nvicular extensions. Extension of the anterior axillary incisions \ndown the lateral abdomen typically will allow adequate release \nof abdominal eschar. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 259.)\n 9.

MRSA culture-positive burn wound infections\nD. To improve patient comfort while reducing the need \nfor daily dressing changesAnswer: A\nSilver sulfadiazine is one of the most widely used in clinical \npractice. Silver sulfadiazine has a wide range of antimicrobial \nactivity, primarily as prophylaxis against burn wound infec -\ntions rather than treatment of existing infections. It has the \nadded benefits of being inexpensive, being easily applied, \nand having soothing qualities. It is not significantly absorbed \nsystemically and thus has minimal metabolic derangements. \nSilver sulfadiazine has a reputation for causing neutropenia,  7. What is the fluid requirement of a 50-kg man with first-\ndegree burns to his left arm and leg, circumferential \nsecond-degree burn to his right arm, and third-degree \nburns to his torso and right leg. What is the rate of initial \nfluid resuscitation?\nA. 4.5 L over 8 hours, followed by 4.5 L over 16 hours\nB. 4.5 L over 8 hours, followed by 6 L over 16 hours\nC. 6 L over 8 hours, followed by 6 L over 16 hours\nD. 6 L over 8 hours, followed by 9 L over 16 hoursAnswer: A\nThe most commonly used formula, the Parkland or Baxter \nformula, consists of 3 to 4 mL/kg per % burn of Lactated \nRinger\u2019s, of which half is given during the first 8 hours after \nburn and the remaining half is given over the subsequent  \n16 hours. The most recent American Burn Association con -\nsensus formula recommends 2 mL/kg per % burn of Lactated \nRingers given the tendency toward excessive fluid adminis -\ntration with the traditional formulas. The concept behind \ncontinuous fluid requirements is simple. The burn (and/\nor inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that \nleads to capillary leak; as plasma leaks into the extravascular \nspace, crystalloid administration maintains the intravascular \nvolume. Therefore, if a patient receives a large fluid bolus in \na prehospital setting or emergency department, the fluid has \nlikely leaked into the interstitium, and the patient still requires \nongoing burn resuscitation according to the estimates. Con -\ntinuation of fluid volumes should depend on the time since \ninjury, urine output, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). As \nthe capillary leak closes, the patient will require less volume to \nmaintain these two resuscitation endpoints. Children under \n20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have \nsufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose \nlevel in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pedi -\natric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach \nis to deliver a weight-based maintenance IV fluid with glu -\ncose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscita -\ntion with lactated Ringer\u2019s.

Silver sulfadiazine.Answer: A\nMafenide acetate, either in cream or solution form, is an \neffective topical antimicrobial. It is effective even in the pres -\nence of eschar and can be used in both treating and prevent -\ning wound infections; the solution formulation is an excellent \nantimicrobial for fresh skin grafts. Use of mafenide acetate \nmay be limited by pain with application to partial-thickness \nburns. As mafenide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, a his -\ntorically described side effect is metabolic acidosis. However, \nmultiple studies have been performed using mafenide to treat \nburn wounds without any significant incidence of metabolic \nacidosis. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 257.)\n 11. Which of the following is TRUE regarding nutritional \nneeds of burn patients?\nA. The hypermetabolic response to burn wounds typi -\ncally raises the basic metabolic rate by 120%.\nB. Oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid, can improve lean \nbody mass but can be associated with hyperglycemia \nand clinically significant rise in hepatic transaminitis.\nC. Early enteral feeding is safe when burns are <20% \ntotal body surface area (TBSA), otherwise enteral \nfeeding should await return of bowel function to \navoid feeding a patient with gastric ileus.\nD. For patients with <40% TBSA, caloric needs are esti -\nmated to be 25 kcal/kg/d plus 40 kcal/%TBSA/d.Answer: D\nCalculating the appropriate caloric needs of the burn patient \ncan be challenging. A commonly used formula in nonburned \npatients is the Harris-Benedict equation, which calculates \ncaloric needs using factors such as gender, age, height, and \nweight. This formula uses an activity factor for specific inju -\nries, and for burns, the basal energy expenditure is multi -\nplied by 2. The Harris-Benedict equation may be inaccurate \nin burns of <40% TBSA, and in these patients, the Curreri \nformula may be more appropriate. This formula estimates \ncaloric needs to be 25 kcal/kg/d plus 40 kcal/%TBSA/d. Indi -\nrect calorimetry can also be used to calculate resting energy \nexpenditure, but in burn patients, a \u201cmetabolic cart\u201d has not \nbeen documented to be more beneficial than the predic -\ntive equations. Titrating caloric needs closely is important \nbecause overfeeding patients will lead to storage of fat instead \nof muscle anabolism. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 258.)\n 12. A 42-year-old man with burns of >40% TBSA was \nrequired a high volume of intravenous fluids over the \nfirst 3 days of his ICU admission to maintain his urine \noutput, which had finally stabilized. However, he has \nbecome increasingly difficult to ventilate, with high peak \npressures, and his urine output is now declining with -\nout response to additional crystalloid. What treatment is \nnow required for this patient?\nA. Discontinuation of crystalloid administration, favor -\ning vasopressor initiation for hemodynamic support, \nif required\nB. Transitioning from crystalloid to colloid\nC. Torso escharotomies\nD. Decompressive laparotomyAnswer: D\nMassive resuscitation of burned patients may lead to an  \nabdominal compartment syndrome characterized by increased \nairway pressures with hypoventilation and decreased urine \noutput and hemodynamic compromise. Decompressive lapa -\nrotomy is the standard of care for refractory abdominal com -\npartment syndrome but carries an especially poor prognosis in \nburn patients. Adjunctive measures such as minimizing fluid, \nperforming torso escharotomies, decreasing tidal volumes, \nand chemical paralysis should be initiated before resorting \nto decompressive laparotomy. Patients undergoing massive \nresuscitation also develop elevated intraocular pressures \nand may require lateral canthotomy. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \np. 258.)but this association is more likely due to neutrophil margin -\nation from the inflammatory response following burn injury. \nTrue allergic reactions to the sulfa component of silver sul -\nfadiazine are rare, and at-risk patients can have a small test \npatch applied to identify a burning sensation or rash. Silver \nsulfadiazine destroys skin grafts and is contraindicated on \nburns or donor sites in proximity to newly grafted areas. Also, \nsilver sulfadiazine may retard epithelial migration in healing  \npartial-thickness wounds. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 257.)\nBrunicardi_Ch08_p065-072.indd   69 30/06/22   10:39 AM"

Heterotopic ossification (HO) associated pain can \nbe often successfully treated with oral pain control, \nphysiotherapy, and radiation therapy.\nD. HO requires surgical excision to prevent malignant \ntransformation of pathologic lamellar bone.Answer: C\nHO is another long-term morbidity associated with burn \ninjury. HO is the pathologic development of lamellar bone in  \nperipheral tissue. Its incidence has been reported to be \nbetween 1% and 3% of burn patients. Symptoms include \ndecreased range of motion, pain, and swelling overlying  \nthe affected joints. Oftentimes, the pathologic bone formation \ncan be visualized radiographically with plain X-rays. Risk fac -\ntors include >30% total body surface area (TBSA), arm burns, \narm grafts, ventilator days, and number of trips to the oper -\nating room.

(See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 261.) 13. Which of the following statements is FALSE concerning \nsurgical treatment of burn wounds?\nA. Tangential excision consists of tangential slices of \nburn tissue until bleeding tissue is encountered. \nThus, excision can be associated with potentially sig -\nnificant blood loss.\nB. Xenographs are a permanent alternative to split \nthickness skin grafts when there is insufficient donor \nsites.\nC. Bleeding from tangential excision can be helped with \ninjection of epinephrine tumescence solution, pneu -\nmatic tourniquets, epinephrine-soaked compresses, \nand fibrinogen and thrombin spray sealant.\nD. Meshed split-thickness skin grafts allow serosan -\nguinous drainage to prevent graft loss and provide a \ngreater area of wound coverage.Answer: B\nOnce the initial resuscitation is complete and the patient is \nhemodynamically stable, attention should be turned to excis -\ning the burn wound. Burn excision and wound coverage \nshould ideally start within the first several days, and in larger \nburns, serial excisions can be performed as patient condition \nallows. Excision is performed with repeated tangential slices \nusing a Watson or Goulian blade until viable, diffusely bleed -\ning tissue remains. It is appropriate to leave healthy dermis, \nwhich will appear white with punctate areas of bleeding. Exci -\nsion to fat or fascia may be necessary in deeper burns. The \ndownside of tangential excision is a high blood loss, though \nthis may be ameliorated using techniques such as instilla -\ntion of an epinephrine tumescence solution underneath the \nburn. Pneumatic tourniquets are helpful in extremity burns, \nand compresses soaked in a dilute epinephrine solution are \nnecessary adjuncts after excision. A fibrinogen and thrombin \nspray sealant (Tisseel Fibrin Sealant; Baxter, Deerfield, IL) also \nhas beneficial effects on both hemostasis and graft adherence \nto the wound bed. The use of these techniques has markedly \ndecreased the number of blood transfusions given during burn \nsurgery. For patients with clearly deep burns and concern for \nexcessive blood loss, fascial excision may be employed. In this \ntechnique, electrocautery is used to excise the burned tissue \nand the underlying subcutaneous tissue down to muscle fas -\ncia. This technique markedly decreases blood loss but results \nin a cosmetically inferior appearance due to the loss of sub -\ncutaneous tissue. For excision of burns in difficult anatomic \nareas, such as the face, eyelids, or hands, a pressurized water \ndissector may offer more precision but is time-consuming,  \nhas a steep learning curve, and is expensive.

PMNs release proteases that degrade ground sub -\nstance within the wound site.\nB. Neurophils use fibrin clot generated at the wound as \nscaffolding for migration into the wound.\nC. Neutrophil migration is stimulated by local prosta -\nglandins, complement factors, IL-1, TNF\u03b1, GF-\u03b2, \nplatelet factor 4, or bacterial products.\nD. PMNs are the first cells to infiltrate the wound, peak -\ning at 24 to 48 hours.\nE. Neutrophils release cytokines that later assist with \ncollagen deposition and epithelial closure.Answer: E\nPMNs are the first infiltrating cells to enter the wound site, \npeaking at 24 to 48 hours. Increased vascular permeability, \nlocal prostaglandin release, and the presence of chemotactic \nsubstances such as complement factors, interleukin-1 (IL-1), \ntumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), TGF- \u03b2, platelet factor 4,  \nor bacterial products all stimulate neutrophil migration.\nThe postulated primary role of neutrophils is phagocytosis \nof bacteria and tissue debris. PMNs are also a major source \nof cytokines early during inflammation, especially TNF-\u03b1, \nwhich may have a significant influence on subsequent angio -\ngenesis and collagen synthesis. PMNs also release proteases \nsuch as collagenases, which participate in matrix and ground \nsubstance degradation in the early phase of wound healing. \nOther than their role in limiting infections, these cells do not \nappear to play a role in collagen deposition or acquisition of \nmechanical wound strength. On the contrary, neutrophil fac -\ntors have been implicated in delaying the epithelial closure of \nwounds. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 273.)\n 3. The proliferative phase of wound healing occurs how \nlong after the injury?\nA. 1 day\nB. 2 days\nC. 7 days\nD. 14 daysAnswer: C\nNormal wound healing follows a predictable pattern that \ncan be divided into overlapping phases defined by the cel -\nlular populations and biochemical activities: (a) hemostasis \nand inflammation, (b) proliferation, and (c) maturation and \nremodeling.\nThe proliferative phase is the second phase of wound heal -\ning and roughly spans days 4 through 12. It is during this phase \nthat tissue continuity is reestablished. Fibroblasts and endo -\nthelial cells are the last cell populations to infiltrate the heal -\ning wound, and the strongest chemotactic factor for fibroblasts \nis platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Upon entering the \nwound environment, recruited fibroblasts first need to prolif -\nerate, and then become activated, to carry out their primary \nfunction of matrix synthesis remodeling. This activation is \nmediated mainly by the cytokines and growth factors released \nfrom wound macrophages. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 273.)\n 4. Which of the following is TRUE regarding the fibroplas -\ntic phase of wound healing?\nA. Early during wound healing, the predominant com -\nposititon of the matrix is fibronectin and type II \ncollagen.\nB. After complete replacement of the scar with type \nIII collagen, the mechanical strength will equal that \nof uninjured tissue approximately 6 to 12 months \npostinjury.\nC. Even though the tensile strength of a wound reaches \na plateau after several weeks, the tensile strength will \nincrease over another 6 to 12 months due to fibril for -\nmation and cross-linking.\nD. As the scar matures, matrix metalloproteinases break \ndown type I collagen and replace it with type III \ncollagen.Answer: C\nThe maturation and remodeling of the scar begins during the \nfibroplastic phase, and is characterized by a reorganization of \npreviously synthesized collagen. Collagen is broken down by \nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and the net wound col -\nlagen content is the result of a balance between collagenolysis \nand collagen synthesis. There is a net shift toward collagen \nsynthesis and eventually the reestablishment of extracellular \nmatrix composed of a relatively acellular collagen-rich scar.\nWound strength and mechanical integrity in the fresh \nwound are determined by both the quantity and quality of \nthe newly deposited collagen. The deposition of matrix at the \nwound site follows a characteristic pattern: fibronectin and \ncollagen type III constitute the early matrix scaffolding; gly -\ncosaminoglycans and proteoglycans represent the next sig -\nnificant matrix components; and collagen type I is the final \nmatrix. By several weeks postinjury the amount of collagen \nin the wound reaches a plateau, but the tensile strength con -\ntinues to increase for several more months. Fibril formation \nand fibril cross-linking result in decreased collagen solubil -\nity, increased strength, and increased resistance to enzymatic \nBrunicardi_Ch09_p073-082.indd   74 06/07/22   9:36 AM"

Allowed to heal by secondary intention, as would \ncommonly fall apart.\nD. There is no benefit to external fixation with adhesive \ntapes.Answer: B\nClosing wounds in patients with EDS might represent a major \nchallenge to the surgeon. Dermal wounds should be closed in \ntwo layers, approximated with the sutures under tension, and \nthe stitches should be left in place twice as long as usual.

FBN-1 gene mutationAnswer: D\nPatients with Marfan syndrome have tall stature, arachnodac -\ntyly, lax ligaments, myopia, scoliosis, pectus excavatum, and \naneurysm of the ascending aorta. Patients who suffer from \nthis syndrome also are prone to hernias. Surgical repair of a \ndissecting aneurysm is difficult, as the soft connective tissue \nfails to hold sutures. Skin may be hyperextensible, but shows \nno delay in wound healing.\nThe genetic defect associated with Marfan syndrome is a \nmutation in the FBN-1  gene which encodes for fibrillin. Pre -\nviously, it was thought that structural alteration of the micro -\nfibrillar system was responsible for the phenotypic changes \nseen with the disease. However, recent research indicates an \nintricate relationship that FBN1 gene products play in TGF-\u03b2 \nsignaling. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 278.)degradation of the collagen matrix. Fibrillin, a glycoprotein \nsecreted by fibroblasts, is essential for the formation of elastic \nfibers found in connective tissue. Scar remodeling continues \nfor many (6 to 12) months postinjury, gradually resulting in a \nmature, avascular, and acellular scar. The mechanical strength \nof the scar never achieves that of the uninjured tissue. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 275.)\n 8. Which of the following is FALSE regarding healing of \nfull-thickness injuries of the gastrointestinal tract?\nA.

Collagen synthesis is done by fibroblast and smooth \nmuscle cells.\nD. The greatest tensile strength of the gastrointestinal \n(GI) tract is provided by the serosa.Answer: D\nThe submucosa lies radially and circumferentially outside \nof these layers, is comprised of abundant collagenous and \nelastic fibers, and supports neural and vascular structures. \nThe submucosa is the layer that imparts the greatest tensile \nstrength and greatest suture-holding capacity, a characteris -\ntic that should be kept in mind during surgical repair of the \nGI tract. Additionally, serosal healing is essential for quickly \nachieving a watertight seal from the luminal side of the bowel. \nThe importance of the serosa is underscored by the signifi -\ncantly higher rates of anastomotic failure observed clinically \nin segments of bowel that are extraperitoneal and lack serosa  \n(ie, the esophagus and rectum).\nThe early integrity of the anastomosis is dependent on \nformation of a fibrin seal on the serosal side, which achieves \nwatertightness, and on the suture-holding capacity of the \nBrunicardi_Ch09_p073-082.indd   75 06/07/22   9:36 AM"

All fetal wounds heal without a scar.\nC. Fetal wounds continue to be scarless and look like \nregeneration throughout gestation until birth.\nD. Fetal wounds in late third trimester resemble an adult \nwound healing pattern.Answer: D\nAlthough early fetal wound healing is characterized by \nthe absence of scarring and resembles tissue regeneration, \nthere is a phase of transition during gestational life when \na more adult-like healing pattern emerges. This so-called  \n\u201ctransition wound\u201d occurs at the beginning of the third  \ntrimester, and during this period, there is scarless healing;  \nhowever, there is a loss of the ability to regenerate skin append -\nages. Eventually a classic, adult-patterned healing with scar \nformation occurs exclusively, although overall healing contin -\nues to be faster than in adults. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 282.) 11. What type of nerve injury involves disruption of axonal \ncontinuity with preserved Schwann cell basal lamina?\nA. Neurapraxia\nB. Axonotemesis\nC. Neurotmesis\nD. AxonolysisAnswer: B\nThere are three types of nerve injuries: neurapraxia (focal \ndemyelination), axonotmesis (interruption of axonal con -\ntinuity but preservation of Schwann cell basal lamina), and \nneurotmesis (complete transection). Following all types of \ninjury, the nerve ends progress through a predictable pattern \nof changes involving three crucial steps: (1) survival of axo -\nnal cell bodies; (2) regeneration of axons that grow across the \ntransected nerve to reach the distal stump; and (3) migration \nand connection of the regenerating nerve ends to the appro -\npriate nerve ends or organ targets.\nPhagocytes remove the degenerating axons and myelin \nsheath from the distal stump (Wallerian degeneration). Regen -\nerating axonal sprouts extend from the proximal stump and \nprobe the distal stump and the surrounding tissues. Schwann \ncells envelope and help in remyelinating the regenerating \naxons. Functional units are formed when the regenerating \naxons connect with the appropriate end targets. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 281.) 10.  Which of the following is TRUE about bone healing?\nA. Erythema and swelling commonly occur as part \nof healing, as it occurs as the bone at the frac -\nture site is degraded and normal bone undergoes \nrevascularization.\nB. Erythema and swelling occur during formation of \nsoft callus.\nC. Callus mineralization is complete in 1 week.\nD. Erythema, swelling, and pain usually take 5 days to \nresolve.Answer: A\nFollowing any type of injury to bone, several changes take place \nat the site of injury to restore structural and functional integ -\nrity. Most of the phases of healing resemble those observed in \ndermal healing, but some notable individual characteristics \napply to bone injuries. The initial stage of hematoma formation \nconsists of an accumulation of blood at the fracture site, which \nalso contains devitalized soft tissue, dead bone, and necrotic \nmarrow. The next stage accomplishes the liquefaction and deg -\nradation of nonviable products at the fracture site. The normal \nbone adjacent to the injury site can then undergo revascular -\nization, with new blood vessels growing into the fracture site. \nThis is similar to the formation of granulation in soft tissue. \nThe symptoms associated with this stage are characteristic of \ninflammation, with clinical evidence of swelling and erythema.\nThree to four days following injury, soft tissue forms a \nbridge between the fractured bone segments in the next \nstage (soft callus stage). The soft tissue is deposited where \nneovascularization has taken place and serves as an internal \nsplint, preventing damage to the newly laid blood vessels and \nachieving a fibrocartilaginous union. The soft callus is formed \nexternally along the bone shaft and internally within the mar -\nrow cavity. Clinically, this phase of healing is characterized by \nthe cessation of pain and inflammatory signs.\nThe next phase consists of mineralization of the soft cal -\nlus and conversion to bone (hard callus stage). This may take \nup to 2 to 3 months and leads to complete bony union. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 281.)\nBrunicardi_Ch09_p073-082.indd   77 06/07/22   9:36 AM"

Glycosylation of proteoglycans and collagen in \nwound bed due to hyperglycemia\nC. Decreased collagen accretion noted in patients with \ntype II diabetes mellitus\nD. Increased bacterial load due to hyperglycemiaAnswer: A\nUncontrolled diabetes results in reduced inflammation, \nangiogenesis, and collagen synthesis. Additionally, the large \nand small vessel disease that is the hallmark of advanced dia -\nbetes contributes to local hypoxemia. Defects in granulocyte \nfunction, capillary ingrowth, and fibroblast proliferation all \nhave been described in diabetes. Obesity, insulin resistance, \nhyperglycemia, and diabetic renal failure contribute signifi -\ncantly and independently to the impaired wound healing \nobserved in diabetics. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 284.) 14. Which of the following does not significantly impair \nwould healing?\nA. Low-oxygen tension\nB. Hypoperfusion\nC. Arterial insufficiency\nD. Mild to moderate anemiaAnswer: D\nLow-oxygen tension has a profoundly deleterious effect on \nall aspects of wound healing. Fibroplasia, although stimu -\nlated initially by the hypoxic wound environment, is signifi -\ncantly impaired by local hypoxia. Optimal collagen synthesis \nrequires oxygen as a cofactor, particularly for the hydroxyl -\nation steps. Increasing subcutaneous oxygen tension levels by \nincreasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of inspired \nair for brief periods during and immediately following sur -\ngery results in enhanced collagen deposition and in decreased \nrates of wound infection after elective surgery.\nMajor factors affecting local oxygen delivery include hypo -\nperfusion either for systemic reasons (low volume or cardiac \nfailure) or due to local causes (arterial insufficiency, local \nvasoconstriction, or excessive tension on tissues). The level of \nvasoconstriction of the subcutaneous capillary bed is exqui -\nsitely responsive to fluid status, temperature, and hyperactive \nsympathetic tone as is often induced by postoperative pain. \nCorrection of these factors can have a remarkable influence on \nwound outcome, particularly on decreasing wound infection \nrates. Mild to moderate normovolemic anemia does not appear \nto adversely affect wound oxygen tension and collagen synthe -\nsis. However, profound anemia with 15% less hematocrit can \ninterfere with wound healing. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 283.) 13. Steroids impair wound healing by:\nA. Decreasing angiogenesis and macrophage migration.\nB. Decreasing platelet plug integrity.\nC. Increasing release of lysosomal enzymes.\nD. Increasing fibrinolysis.Answer: A\nThe major effect of steroids is to inhibit the inflammatory \nphase of wound healing (angiogenesis, neutrophil and macro -\nphage migration, and fibroblast proliferation) and the release \nof lysosomal enzymes. The stronger the anti-inflammatory \neffect of the steroid compound used, the greater the inhibi -\ntory effect on wound healing. Steroids used after the first 3 to \n4 days postinjury do not affect wound healing as severely as \nwhen they are used in the immediate postoperative period. \nTherefore if possible, their use should be delayed or, alterna -\ntively, forms with lesser anti-inflammatory effects should be \nadministered.\nIn addition to their effect on collagen synthesis, steroids \nalso inhibit epithelialization and contraction and contrib -\nute to increased rates of wound infection, regardless of the \ntime of administration. Steroid-delayed healing of cutaneous \nwounds can be stimulated to epithelialize by topical appli -\ncation of vitamin A. Collagen synthesis of steroid-treated \nwounds also can be stimulated by vitamin A. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 283.)\nBrunicardi_Ch09_p073-082.indd   78 06/07/22   9:36 AM"

Vitamin C and vitamin A.Answer: D\nThe vitamins most closely involved with wound healing are \nvitamin C and vitamin A. Scurvy or vitamin C deficiency \nleads to a defect in wound healing, particularly via a failure \nin collagen synthesis and cross-linking. Biochemically, vita -\nmin C is required for the conversion of proline and lysine to \nhydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively. Vitamin C \ndeficiency has also been associated with an increased inci -\ndence of wound infection, and if wound infection does occur, \nit tends to be more severe. These effects are believed to be \ndue to an associated impairment in neutrophil function, \ndecreased complement activity, and decreased walling-off of \nbacteria secondary to insufficient collagen deposition. The \nrecommended dietary allowance is 60 mg daily. This provides \na considerable safety margin for most healthy nonsmokers. In \nseverely injured or extensively burned patients, this require -\nment may increase to as high as 2 g daily. There is no evidence \nthat excess vitamin C is toxic; however, there is no evidence \nthat supratherapeutic doses of vitamin C are of any benefit.\nVitamin A deficiency impairs wound healing, while sup -\nplemental vitamin A benefits wound healing in nondeficient \nhumans and animals. Vitamin A increases the inflammatory \nresponse in wound healing, probably by increasing the lability \nof lysosomal membranes. There is an increased influx of mac -\nrophages, with an increase in their activation and increased  16. Nutrition is important in recovery from trauma or sur -\ngical injury. Which of the following is not TRUE about \nnutrition in wound healing?\nA. Adequate protein and calorie intake is needed for \nwound healing.\nB. Brief periods of starvation, or absence of nutrient \nintake has no impact on wound healing.\nC. Arginine supplementation is associated with \nimproved outcome.\nD. Brief nutritional interventions can correct collagen \ndeposition deficits seen in malnutrition and postop -\nerative starvation.Answer: B\nMalnutrition correlates clinically with enhanced rates of \nwound complications and increased wound failure following \ndiverse surgical procedures. This reflects impaired healing \nresponse as well as reduced cell-mediated immunity, phago -\ncytosis, and intracellular killing of bacteria by macrophages \nand neutrophils during protein-calorie malnutrition.\nFirst, the degree of nutritional impairment need not be \nlong-standing in humans, as opposed to the experimental \nsituation. Thus, patients with brief preoperative illnesses or \nreduced nutrient intake in the period immediately preced -\ning the injury or operative intervention will demonstrate \nimpaired fibroplasias. Second, brief and not necessarily \nintensive nutritional intervention, either via the parenteral or \nenteral route, can reverse or prevent the decreased collagen \ndeposition noted with malnutrition or with postoperative \nstarvation.\nThe possible role of single amino acids in enhanced wound \nhealing has been studied for the last several decades. Arginine \nappears most active in terms of enhancing wound fibropla -\nsia. Arginine deficiency results in decreased wound-breaking \nstrength and wound-collagen accumulation in chow-fed rats. \nRats that are given 1% arginine HCl supplementation, and \ntherefore are not arginine-deficient, have enhanced wound-\nbreaking strength and collagen synthesis when compared to \nchow-fed controls. Studies have been carried out in healthy \nhuman volunteers to examine the effect of arginine supple -\nmentation on collagen accumulation. Y oung, healthy, human \nvolunteers (age 25\u201335 years) were found to have significantly \nincreased wound-collagen deposition following oral supple -\nmentation with either 30 g of arginine aspartate (17 g of free \narginine) or 30 g of arginine Hall (24.8 g of free arginine) \ndaily for 14 days.

Distal edema.Answer: B\nMalignant transformation of chronic ulcers can occur in \nany long-standing wound (Marjolin\u2019s ulcer). Any wound \nthat does not heal for a prolonged period of time is prone \nto malignant transformation. Malignant wounds are differ -\nentiated clinically from nonmalignant wounds by the pres -\nence of overturned wound edges. In patients with suspected \nmalignant transformations, biopsy of the wound edges must \nbe performed to rule out malignancy. Cancers arising de novo \nin chronic wounds include both squamous and basal cell car -\ncinomas. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 289.) 18.

Most commonly this is due to Clostridia perfringens  \nand other related species.\nD. Removal of all necrotic material is essential for infec -\ntion control.Answer: C\nThe most dangerous of the deep infections is necrotizing fas -\nciitis. It results in high mortality, particularly in the elderly. \nThis is an invasive process that involves the fascia and leads \nto secondary skin necrosis. Pathophysiologically, it is a sep -\ntic thrombosis of the vessels between the skin and the deep \nlayers. The skin demonstrates hemorrhagic bullae and sub -\nsequent frank necrosis, with surrounding areas of inflamma -\ntion and edema. The fascial necrosis is usually wider than the \nskin involvement or than the surgeon estimates on clinical \ngrounds. The patient is toxic and has high fever, tachycar -\ndia, and marked hypovolemia, which if uncorrected, pro -\ngresses to cardiovascular collapse. Bacteriologically, this is a \nmixed infection, and samples should be obtained for Gram \nstain smears and cultures to aid in diagnosis and treatment. \nAs soon as bacteriologic studies have been obtained, high-\ndose penicillin treatment needs to be started (20\u201340 million  \nU/d intravenously) due to concern over the presence of  \nC. perfringens  and other related species; broad-spectrum anti -\nbiotics should be added and the regimen modified based on \nculture results.

The aim of surgi -\ncal treatment is thorough removal of all necrosed skin and \nfascia. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 288.)collagen synthesis. Vitamin A directly increases collagen \nproduction and epidermal growth factor receptors when it is \nadded in vitro to cultured fibroblasts. As mentioned before, \nsupplemental vitamin A can reverse the inhibitory effects of \ncorticosteroids on wound healing.

            "Text": "83Answer: C\nThere are six essential alterations in cell physiology that dic -\ntate malignant growth: self-sufficiency of growth signals, \ninsensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals, evasion of apop -\ntosis (programmed cell death), potential for limitless repli -\ncation, angiogenesis, and invasion and metastasis. Recently, \ntwo additional hallmarks have emerged\u2014reprogramming of \nenergy metabolism and evading immune destruction. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 310.)\n 2.

Ability to evade autophagy\nD. Ability to evade immune destruction\nAnswer: D\nAbnormally proliferating transformed cells outgrow normal \ncells in the culture dish (ie, in vitro) and commonly display \nseveral abnormal characteristics. These include loss of contact \ninhibition (ie, cells continue to proliferate after a confluent \nmonolayer is formed); an altered appearance and poor adher -\nence to other cells or to the substratum; loss of anchorage \ndependence for growth; immortalization; and gain of tumori -\ngenicity (ie, the ability to give rise to tumors when injected \ninto an appropriate host). (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 310.)\n 3. The cell cycle includes all of the following phases \nEXCEPT:\nA. S phase\nB. G1 phase\nC. G2 phase\nD. G3 phase.Answer: D\nThe cell cycle is divided into four phases. During the syn -\nthetic or S phase, the cell generates a single copy of its genetic \nmaterial, whereas in the mitotic or M phase, the cellular com -\nponents are partitioned between two daughter cells. The G1 \nand G2 phases represent gap phases during which the cells \nprepare themselves for completion of the S and M phases, \nrespectively. When cells cease proliferation, they exit the cell \ncycle and enter the quiescent state referred to as G0. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., pp. 311\u2013312.)CHAPTER 10\nOncology\n 4.

Anti-caspases are a family of genes involved in regu -\nlation of apoptosis.\nD. DNA laddering is a typical characteristic observed \nwith apoptosis.Answer: D\nApoptosis is a genetically regulated program to dispose of \ncells. Cancer cells must avoid apoptosis if tumors are to arise. \nLate in apoptosis, there are characteristic changes in nuclear \nmorphology, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear frag -\nmentation, and DNA laddering. The apoptosis effectors are \na family of proteases called caspases. The Beclin 1  gene is an \nimportant gene for autophagy.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) enhance the \nstructural integrity of the extracellular matrix.\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces \nmetastases exclusively through vascular channels.Answer: B\nA feature of malignant cells is their ability to invade the sur -\nrounding normal tissue. Tumors in which the malignant cells \nappear to lie exclusively above the basement membrane are \nreferred to as in situ cancer . Integrins are a family of glyco -\nproteins that regulate cell adhesion and also relay molecular \nsignals regarding the cellular environment that influence \nshape, survival, proliferation, gene transcription, and migra -\ntion. MMPs comprise a family of metal-dependent endo -\npeptidases. Upon activation, MMPs degrade a variety of \nECM components. VEGF has various functions, including \nincreasing vascular permeability, inducing endothelial cell \nproliferation and tube formation, and inducing endothelial \ncell synthesis of proteolytic enzymes. The proliferation of \nnew lymphatic vessels, lymph angiogenesis, is also thought \nto be controlled by the VEGF family. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \npp. 315\u2013316.) 5.

Late development of metastasis as long as 20 years \nafter primary tumor curative treatment is a common \noccurrence.\nC. Tumor dormancy may be due to the host losing \nimmunologic control of subclinical disease.\nD. The \u201cseed and soil\u201d conception of metastasis is \nexplained by organ-specific patterns of blood flow \ndeterminants.Answer: C\nMetastases arise due to the spread of cancer cells from the \nprimary site and the formation of new tumors in distance \nlocations. Overall, metastasis is an inefficient process; only a \nsmall subset of cancer cells is able to initiate micrometastases, \nand an even smaller portion goes on to grow into macrome -\ntastases. Recurrences are rare after 20 years; however, cancer \nrecurrences have been reported decades after the original \ntumor episode. This phenomenon is referred to as dormancy . \nAn explanation for preferential metastasis is what is referred \nto as the \u201cseed and soil\u201d theory, the dependence of the seed \n(the cancer cell) on the soil (the secondary site). According to \nthis theory, once cells have reached a secondary organ, their \ngrowth efficiency in that organ is based on the compatibility \nof the cancer cell\u2019s biology with its new microenvironment. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 316\u2013317.)\nBrunicardi_Ch10_p083-086.indd   84 30/06/22   10:39 AM"

Patient selection is the key to the \nsuccess of surgical therapy for distance metastases. The cancer \ntype is a major determinant in surgical decision-making. The \ngrowth rate of the tumor also plays an important role. Patients \nwith longer disease-free intervals have a higher survival rate \nafter surgical metastasectomy than those with a short disease-\nfree interval. In curative surgery for distance metastases, \nas with surgery for primary tumors, the goal is to resect the \nmetastases with negative margins, whether or not open or MIS \napproaches are used.

The term \u201cprognostic marker\u201d \ngenerally is used to describe molecular markers that predict \ndisease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall \nsurvival, whereas the term \u201cpredictive marker\u201d often is used in \nthe context of predicting response to certain therapies. Multi -\ngene profiles to predict prognosis are in validation phase for \nmany solid tumor types. ( See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 334\u2013335.)\nBrunicardi_Ch10_p083-086.indd   85 30/06/22   10:39 AM"

            "Text": "87Answer: A\nTransplantation is the process of transferring an organ, tis -\nsue, or cell from one place to another. An organ transplant is \na surgical procedure in which a failing organ is replaced by a \nfunctioning one. The organ is transplanted either orthotopi -\ncally (implanted in the same anatomic location in the recipi -\nent as it was in the donor) or heterotopically (implanted in \nanother anatomic location). Orthotopic transplants require \nthe removal of the diseased organ (heart, lungs, liver, or intes -\ntine); in heterotopic transplants, the diseased organ is kept in \nplace (kidney, pancreas).\nAccording to the degree of immunologic similarity between \nthe donor and recipient, transplants are divided into three \nmain categories: (a) an autotransplant is the transfer of cells, \ntissue, or an organ from one part of the body to another part \nin the same person, so no immunosuppression is required; \nthis type of transplant includes skin, artery or vein, bone, car -\ntilage, nerve, and islet cell transplants; (b) an allotransplant \nis the transfer of cells, tissue, or an organ from one person \nto another of the same species; with the exception of identi -\ncal twins, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the \ndonated organ as a foreign body, so immunosuppression is \nrequired in order to avoid rejection; and (c) a xenotransplant \nis the transfer of cells, tissue, or an organ from one organism to \nanother of a different species. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 356.) 1. Which of the following definitions is FALSE?\nA. Transplantation is the process of transferring only \nintact organs from one person to another.\nB. Orthotopic transplanted organs are implanted in the \nsame place as the native organ.\nC. Heterotopic transplanted organs in a different place, \nso that the native organs do not need to be removed.\nD. Allotransplant means transplant of cells or organs \nfrom one person to another.\n 2. In humans:\nA. Antigen encoding genes are located on chromosome 8.\nB. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) system in \nhumans is called the human histocompatibility com -\nplex (HHC).\nC. Class I antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) are expressed \non all nucleated cells.\nD. Class II antigens are expressed on all nucleated cells.Answer: C\nThe main antigens responsible for this process are part of the \nMHC. In humans, these antigens make up the human leuko -\ncyte antigen (HLA) system. The antigen-encoding genes are \nlocated on chromosome 6. Two major classes of HLA anti -\ngens are recognized. They differ in their structure, function, \nand tissue distribution. Class I antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B,  \nand HLA-C) are expressed by all nucleated cells. Class II anti -\ngens (HLA-DR, HLA-DP , and HLA-DQ) are expressed by  \nantigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B lymphocytes, den -\ndritic cells, macrophages, and other phagocytic cells.

It has fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects than \nazathiaprine (AZA).\nC. Like AZA, it interferes with lymphocyte proliferation \nby interfering with purine synthesis.\nD. Its use is limited to induction immunosuppression.Answer: D\nThe antimetabolite, AZA is converted to 6-mercaptopurine \nand inhibits both the de novo purine synthesis and salvage \npurine synthesis. AZA decreases T-lymphocyte activity and \ndecreases antibody production. It has been used as a first-line \nagent in transplant recipients for >40 years, but it became an \nadjunctive agent after the introduction of cyclosporine. With \nthe development of newer agents such as MMF, the use of \nAZA has decreased significantly. However, it is preferred in \nrecipients who are considering conceiving a child because \nMMF is teratogenic and can cause birth defects. Use of AZA \nremains an option for recipients who cannot tolerate the GI \nside effects of MMF.\nThe most significant side effect of AZA, often dose-related, \nis bone marrow suppression. Leukopenia is often reversible \nwith dose reduction or temporary cessation of the drug. Other \nsignificant side effects include hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, \nneoplasia, anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis. Its most signifi -\ncant drug interaction is with allopurinol, which blocks AZA \nmetabolism, increasing the risk of pancytopenia. Recom -\nmendations are to not use AZA and allopurinol together, or if \ndoing so is unavoidable, to decrease the dose of AZA by 75%.\nMMF has now been incorporated into routine maintenance \nregimens after many solid organ transplants. Mycophenolate \nis the prodrug of mycophenolate acid, derive from Penicillium  \nfungi. Mycophenolate acid is an inhibitor of inosine mono -\nphosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) involved in the de novo \npathway of purine synthesis. MMF is available in capsules (250 \nand 500 mg); the starting dose is 1 g twice daily. ( See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 361.)\n 5. Compared to cyclosporin, tacrolimus:\nA. Can be given intravenously, but cyclosporin must be \ngiven orally.\nB. They both are calcineurin inhibitors.\nC. Levels do not need to be monitored.\nD. Is more associated with gingival hyperplasia and hir -\nsutism than cyclosporin.Answer: B\nCyclosporin binds with its cytoplasmic receptor protein, \ncyclophilin, which subsequently inhibits the activity of cal -\ncineurin, thereby decreasing the expression of several critical \nT-cell activation genes, the most important being for IL-2. As \na result, T-cell activation is suppressed. Cyclosporin can be \ngiven intravenously or orally to maintain trough levels of 250 \nto 350 ng/mL for the first 3 months posttransplant; then it can \nbe tapered to 150 to 250 ng/mL.\nThe metabolism of cyclosporine is via the cytochrome P450 \nsystem, resulting in many significant drug interactions (see \nTable 11-1). Calcineurin inhibitors are nephrotoxic and con -\nstrict the afferent arteriole in a dose-dependent, reversible \nmanner (Table 11-2). They also can cause hyperkalemia and \nhypomagnesemia. Several neurologic complications, including \nheadaches, tremor, and seizures, also have been reported. 3. Hyperacute rejection is caused by:\nA. Preformed antibodies.\nB. B-cell\u2013generated antidonor antibodies.\nC. T-cell\u2013mediated allorejection.\nD. Nonimmune mechanism.Answer: A\nHyperacute rejection, a very rapid type of rejection, results \nin irreversible damage and graft loss within minutes to hours \nafter organ reperfusion. It is triggered by preformed antibod -\nies against the donor\u2019s HLA or ABO blood group antigens. \nThese antibodies activate a series of events that result in dif -\nfuse intravascular coagulation, causing ischemic necrosis of \nthe graft. Fortunately, pretransplant blood group typing and \ncross-matching (in which the donor\u2019s cells are mixed with \nthe recipient\u2019s serum, and then the cells are observed for any \ndestruction) have virtually eliminated the incidence of hyper -\nacute rejection.

Inhibits lymphocyte nucleic acid metabolism.\nC. Results in rapid decrease in the number of circulating \nT lymphocytes.\nD. Selectively inhibits T-cell activation.Answer: D\nCorticosteroids have had a role in immunosuppression since \nthe beginning of the field of transplantation. Despite numer -\nous attempts to limit or discontinue their use, they remain an \nintegral component of most immunosuppressive protocols, \nfor both induction and maintenance. Moreover, they are often \nthe first-line agents in the treatment of acute rejection. The \nintroduction of cyclosporine in the early 1980s dramatically \naltered the field of transplantation by significantly improving \noutcomes after kidney transplantation. Cyclosporine binds \nwith its cytoplasmic receptor protein, cyclophilin, which sub -\nsequently inhibits the activity of calcineurin, thereby decreas -\ning the expression of several critical T-cell activation genes, \nthe most important being for IL-2. As a result, T-cell activa -\ntion is suppressed. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 362.)\n 8. Late infections in transplant recipients are:\nA. Generally due to suppression of humoral immunity.\nB. Common bacterial infections.\nC. Depression of cell-mediated immunity renders recip -\nients less susceptible to opportunistic infections.\nD. Depression of cell-mediated immunity renders recip -\nients more susceptible to viruses, fungi, and parasites.Answer: D\nLate infections primarily are due to chronic immunosup -\npression, specifically the depression of cell-mediated immu -\nnity that renders recipients susceptible to viruses, fungi, and \nparasites.\nMembers of the herpesvirus group are the most common \netiologic agents of viral infections posttransplantation, with \nherpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and \nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the most prominent. Pre -\ntransplant exposure to viruses may confer immunity. Recipi -\nents who are seronegative for HSV , CMV , and/or EBV have \na higher incidence of posttransplant infections, especially if \nthey receive donor allografts from seropositive donors. After \n6 months posttransplant, the risk of invasive fungal infections \nis closely associated with environmental exposures.

(See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 363.) 6. The most significant side effect of Sirolimus is:\nA. Anemia.\nB. Leukopenia.\nC. Impaired wound healing.\nD. Hypertriglyceridemia.Answer: D\nThe first mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors \nto enter clinical use was sirolimus (Rapamune). The mTOR \ninhibitors bind to FK506-binding protein (FKBP), and the \nsirolimus-FKBP complex binds to mTOR. Sirolimus also \ninhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, possi -\nbly easing the vasculopathy and progressive fibrosis that can \naffect allografts. Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP3A4/4 and \nhas many significant drug interactions. Sirolimus has been \nused in a variety of combinations for maintenance immuno -\nsuppression, alone or in conjunction with one of the calci -\nneurin inhibitors. In such combinations, sirolimus usually is \nused to help withdraw from, or completely avoid, the use of \nsteroids. It also has been used as an alternative to tacrolimus \nor cyclosporine, in a calcineurin-sparing protocol. One of the \nmost significant side effects of sirolimus is hypertriglyceride -\nmia, a condition that may be resistant to statins and fibrates. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 361.)\nBrunicardi_Ch11_p087-096.indd   90 04/07/22   1:31 PM"

Diabetes mellitus.\nD. Obstructive uropathy.Answer: C\nDiabetes and hypertension are the leading causes of chronic \nrenal disease. Concomitant cardiovascular disease (CVD) \nis a common finding in this population. An estimated 30% \nto 42% of deaths with a functioning kidney graft are due to \nCVD. Therefore, assessment of the potential kidney trans -\nplant candidate\u2019s cardiovascular status is an important part of \nthe pretransplant evaluation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 369.) 10. Compared to deceased donor kidneys, living donor kid -\nney transplants:\nA. Must be from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) iden -\ntical relatives.\nB. Are associated with improved posttransplant \noutcomes.\nC. Increase in delayed graft function.\nD. Have lower 1-year graft survival rate.Answer: B\nThe advantages of a living donor kidney transplant include bet -\nter posttransplant outcomes, avoidance of prolonged waiting \ntime and dialysis, and the ability to coordinate the donor and \nrecipient procedures in a timely fashion. Living donor kidney \nrecipients enjoy better long-term outcomes, a low incidence \nof delayed graft function, and reduced risks of posttransplant \ncomplications. Furthermore, the elective nature of living donor \nkidney transplants provides unique opportunities for recipient \ndesensitization treatment if the donor and recipient are ABO- \nincompatible or if the HLA cross-match results are positive.\nPosttransplant outcomes have continued to improve. In \n2015, the 1-year graft survival rate with a living donor kidney \nwas nearly 98%; with a deceased donor kidney, the rate was \napproximately 95%. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 368.)\n 12.

Heterotopically, in the retroperitoneal space with \nanastomosis to iliac vessels.\nD. Orthotopically, with anastomosis to the adrenal \nartery and veins.Answer: C\nKidney allografts usually are transplanted heterotopically. \nThe iliac fossa is recognized as the ideal position because \nof its proximity to the recipient\u2019s bladder and iliac vessels.  \nRetroperitoneal allograft placement also allows easy access \nfor percutaneous biopsies and interventions for ureteral \ncomplications.

Compared to donation after rain death, donation after \ncardiac death (DCD):\nA. Most patients meet the criteria for brain death.\nB. Is associated with increased warm ischemia time.\nC. In both procurement surgeons wait until cessation of \ncardiac activity.\nD. Transfer to the operating room occurs after cessation \nof cardiac activity.Answer: B\nGiven the severe shortage of donor organs, DCD\u2014also known \nas donation by non\u2013heart-beating donors (NHBDs)\u2014was \nreintroduced to the transplant community in the 1990s. The \ncategory of DCD (Maastricht classification) was initially \nproposed at an international workshop and is now widely \nadopted for organ procurement. Currently, most NHBDs in \nthe United States meet Maastricht classification III; that is, they \nhave suffered a devastating injury with no chance of a mean -\ningful recovery but do not meet the criteria for brain death. \nAfter consent for donation is obtained from the next of kin, \nthe donor\u2019s life support is removed. After the cessation of car -\ndiac and respiratory function, organ procurement commences. \nDCD procurement protocols vary between states; religious and \ncultural differences need to be taken into consideration. The \nsurgical team must be familiar with, and respect, the local pro -\ntocol. With cardiac death (as opposed to brain death), warm \nischemic injury to organs can occur during the period between \ncirculatory cessation and rapid core cooling through perfu -\nsion of preservation solution. However, the difference in long-\nterm outcomes is negligible for recipients of organs from either  \ntype of donor. Still, a significant percentage of liver grafts pro -\ncured after cardiac death, especially those with >25 minutes of \nwarm ischemic time, develop devastating ischemic cholangi -\nopathy and fail.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN).\nC. Graft thrombosis.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nSuddenly decreased or minimal urine output requires imme -\ndiate attention. A change in volume status is the most com -\nmon cause, but other culprits include blockage of the urinary \ncatheter, urinary leak, vascular thrombosis, hypotension, \ndrug-related nephrotoxicity, ATN, and rejection (all of which \nmust be thoroughly investigated). Diagnostic studies such as \nDoppler ultrasound, nuclear renograms, or biopsies should \nbe considered.\nPostoperative bleeding is an uncommon event after a kid -\nney transplant. Recipients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet \ntreatments are at increased risk. Signs and symptoms (such \nas an expanding hematoma over the surgical site, increased \npain over the graft, a falling hemoglobin level, hypotension, \nand tachycardia) should arouse suspicion of hemorrhage. \nDoppler ultrasound is useful to establish the underlying \ncause. Surgical exploration seldom is required because the \naccumulated hematoma tamponades the bleed.

For the secre -\ntions, the two most common techniques are drainage of \nthe duodenal segment to the bladder (bladder drainage) or \nto the small bowel (enteric drainage) (Figs. 11-2 and 11-3). \nFor venous drainage, systemic venous drainage is preferred \nover portal venous drainage.

About 3000 patients are added to the \nwaiting list each year. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 389.)\n 20. The best method for monitoring the development of acute \nrejection in a patient after cardiac transplantation is:\nA. Dipyrimidole thallium study.\nB. Electrocardiogram.\nC. Endomyocardial biopsy.\nD. Echocardiography (ultrasound of heart).Answer: C\nThe goal of immunosuppression is to prevent rejection, \nwhich is assessed by immunosuppressive levels and, early \non, by endomyocardial biopsy. Both T-cell\u2013mediated (cellu -\nlar) and B-cell\u2013mediated (antibody-mediated) rejection are \nmonitored. Most of the immunosuppression used is aimed at \nT-cells; however, if the recipient has many preformed anti -\nbodies or develops donor-specific antibodies, other strategies \n(such as plasmapheresis or rituximab) are used to reduce the \nantibody load. Immunosuppressive regimens can vary by cen -\nter, but most often consist of three categories of medications: a  \ncalcineurin inhibitor (usually tacrolimus or cyclosporine), \nan antiproliferative agent (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or  \nazathioprine [AZA]), and a corticosteroid (prednisone).

Age > 70Answer: D\nIn general, contraindications to a liver transplant include \ninsufficient cardiopulmonary reserve, uncontrolled malig -\nnancy or infection, and refractory noncompliance. Older age \nis only a relative contraindication: carefully selected recipi -\nents age >70 years can achieve satisfactory outcomes.

Those \nresults were replicated at other experienced transplant cen -\nters, but the rates of long-term (>5 year) insulin indepen -\ndence remained poor, well below those of whole-pancreas \ntransplants. Still, despite the low rates of long-term insulin \nindependence, most islet recipients were C-peptide positive \nand retained hypoglycemia awareness, indicating residual \nislet function and benefit. In fact, at 9 years posttransplant, \n15% remained insulin-independent, and 73% had hypogly -\ncemia awareness and corrected hemoglobin Aic levels. ( See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 378.)\n 22.

A and C onlyAnswer: D\nThe MELD was originally developed to assess risk for tran -\nsjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. \nLater analysis revealed it to be an excellent model to predict \nsurvival among patients with cirrhosis, especially those on \nthe waiting list for a liver transplant. In 2002, liver graft allo -\ncation was restructured to be based on the MELD score.\nAlthough the historic indication for a liver transplant is \ndecompensated cirrhosis, a landmark analysis comparing \nwaiting list mortality with posttransplant mortality estab -\nlished that a minimum MELD score of 18 is necessary to have \na survival benefit posttransplant. A MELD score between 15 \nand 18 does not confer a survival advantage, but a transplant \nmay be justified if the patient has significant morbidity from \ncirrhosis.

However, this estimate by the IOM was not based \non primary research conducted by the IOM; rather, it was \nbased on two older studies conducted in 1984 and 1992. Both \nstudies were small and limited.

Occur more frequently in elective procedures.\nC. Are less likely to occur when multiple surgeons take \npart in an operation.\nD. Are most frequently surgical needles.Answer: A\nA retained surgical item refers to any surgical item found to \nbe inside a patient after he or she has left the operating room \n(OR), thus requiring a second operation to remove the item. \nEstimates of retained foreign bodies in surgical procedures \nrange from one case per 8000 to 18,000 operations, corre -\nsponding to one case or more each year for a typical large \nhospital or approximately 1500 cases per year in the United \nStates. This estimate is based on an analysis of malpractice \nclaims and is likely to underestimate the true incidence. The \nrisk of having a retained surgical item increases during emer -\ngency surgery, when there are unplanned changes in pro -\ncedure (due to new diagnoses encountered in the OR), and \nin patients with higher body mass index (Table 12-2). (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 410.) 6. The root cause of the majority of wrong-site surgeries \nresults from:\nA. Communication errors.\nB. Emergency surgery.\nC. Multiple procedures.\nD. Multiple surgeons.Answer: A\nThe risk of performing wrong-site surgery increases when \nthere are multiple surgeons involved in the same operation \nor multiple procedures are performed on the same patient, \nespecially if the procedures are scheduled or performed on \ndifferent areas of the body. Time pressure, emergency sur -\ngery, abnormal patient anatomy, and morbid obesity are also \nthought to be risk factors. Communication errors are the root \ncause in more than 70% of the wrong-site surgeries reported \nto The Joint Commission. Other risk factors include receiving \nan incomplete preoperative assessment; having inadequate \nprocedures in place to verify the correct surgical site; or hav -\ning an organizational culture that lacks teamwork or reveres \nthe surgeon as someone whose judgment should never be \nquestioned.

Allows hospitals to compare their rates of postopera -\ntive events and compare them to similar hospitals.Answer: D\nThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program \n(NSQIP) is a measurement program that allows hospitals to \nsample their rates of postoperative events and compare them \nto similar hospitals. Created by the Veterans Health Admin -\nistration (V A) in 1991, NSQIP has been credited with mea -\nsuring and improving morbidity and mortality outcomes at \nthe V A, reducing 30-day mortality rate after major surgery by \n31%, and 30-day postoperative morbidity by 45% in its first \ndecade. Beta testing at 18 non-V A sites from 2001 to 2004 \ndemonstrated the feasibility and utility of the program in the \nprivate sector. The program was subsequently expanded to \nthe private sector in 2004.

Respiratory failure despite normal chest X-ray.Answer: B\nThe Berlin definition of ARDS developed by the American-\nEuropean Consensus Conference of 2012 not only simplifies \nthe definition of ARDS but also eliminates the term Acute \nLung Injury ( ALI) from critical care vernacular. ARDS is \nnow classified by partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood \n(PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) ratios as mild \n(300\u2013201 mmHg), moderate (200\u2013101 mmHg), and severe \n(<100 mmHg). Elements of modification of the definition \ninclude the following: <7 days of onset; removal of pulmo -\nnary artery occlusion pressure; and clinical judgment for \ncharacterizing hydrostatic pulmonary edema is acceptable, \nunless risk factors for ARDS have been eliminated, in which \ncase objective analysis is necessary.\nThe definition of ARDS traditionally included five crite -\nria (Table 12-3). The multicenter ARDS Research Network \n(ARDSnet) research trial demonstrated improved clinical \noutcomes for ARDS patients ventilated at tidal volumes of \nonly 5 to 7 mL/kg.

Pneumothorax is eliminated using ultrasound when \nplacing the line.\nC. Central line infections are associated with significant \nmortality and increased hospital costs.\nD. Frequent line changes are recommended to decrease \ninfection risk.Answer: C\nPneumothorax occurrence rates from both subclavian and \ninternal jugular vein approaches are 1% to 6%. Prevention \nrequires proper positioning of the patient and correct inser -\ntion technique. A postprocedure chest X-ray is recommended \nto confirm the presence or absence of a pneumothorax, \nregardless of whether a pneumothorax is suspected. Recent \nreports have questioned whether a chest X-ray is required \nwhen the line is placed and confirmed under ultrasound \nguidance. Pneumothorax rates are higher among inexpe -\nrienced providers and underweight patients but occur with \nexperienced operators as well.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nreports mortality rates of 12% to 25% when a central venous \nline infection becomes systemic, with a cost of approximately \n$25,000 per episode. The CDC does not recommend routine \ncentral line changes, but when the clinical suspicion of infec -\ntion is high, the site of venous access must be changed.

Alvimopan, a \u03bc -opioid receptor antagonistAnswer: D\nPostoperative ileus is related to dysfunction of the neural reflex \naxis of the intestine. Excessive narcotic use may delay return \nof bowel function. Epidural anesthesia results in better pain \ncontrol, and there is an earlier return of bowel function and \na shorter length of hospital stay. The limited use of nasogas -\ntric tubes and the initiation of early postoperative feeding are \nassociated with an earlier return of bowel function. The use \nof chewing gum and other oral stimulants to minimize ileus \nremains controversial. Pharmacologic agents commonly used \nto stimulate bowel function include metoclopramide and \nerythromycin. Metoclopramide\u2019s action is limited to the stom -\nach and duodenum, and it may help primarily with gastropa -\nresis. Erythromycin is a motilin agonist that works throughout \nthe stomach and bowel. Several studies demonstrate significant \nbenefit from the administration of erythromycin in those suf -\nfering from an ileus. Alvimopan, a newer agent and a \u03bc-opioid \nreceptor antagonist, has shown some promise in many studies \nfor earlier return of gut function and subsequent reduction in \nlength of stay.

Prophylactic \nuse of antibiotics should simply not be continued beyond this \ntime. Irrigation of the operative field and the surgical wound \nwith saline solution has shown benefit in controlling wound \ninoculum.

The treatment of choice for a biloma after laparoscopic \ncholecystectomy is:\nA. Reoperation, closure of the leak, and drainage.\nB. Percutaneous drainage.\nC. Biliary stent.\nD. Observation.Answer: C\nComplications involving the hepatobiliary system are usually \ndue to technical errors. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has \nbecome the standard of care for cholecystectomy, but com -\nmon bile duct injury remains a nemesis of this approach. \nIntraoperative cholangiography has not been shown to \ndecrease the incidence of common bile duct injuries because \nthe injury to the bile duct usually occurs before the cholan -\ngiogram. Early recognition and immediate repair of an injury \nare important because delayed bile duct leaks often require a \nmore complex repair.\nIschemic injury due to devascularization of the common \nbile duct has a delayed presentation days to weeks after an \noperation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography \n(ERCP) demonstrates a stenotic, smooth common bile duct, \nand liver function studies are elevated. The recommended \ntreatment is a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\nA bile leak due to an unrecognized injury to the ducts may \npresent after cholecystectomy as a biloma. These patients \nmay present with abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia. \nThe diagnosis of a biliary leak can be confirmed by CT scan, \nERCP , or radionuclide scan. Once a leak is confirmed, a ret -\nrograde biliary stent and external drainage are the treatment \nof choice. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 422.)\nBrunicardi_Ch12_p097-104.indd   102 05/07/22   3:32 PM"

In the region of higher DO2 values, the slope \nof the line is approximately equal to zero, indicating that VO2 \nis largely independent of DO2. In contrast, in the region of \nlow DO2 values, the slope of the line is nonzero and positive, \nindicating that VO2 is supply-dependent. The region where \nthe two lines intersect is called the point of critical oxygen \ndelivery (DO2crit), and represents the transition from supply-\nindependent to supply-dependent oxygen uptake. Below \na critical threshold of oxygen delivery, increased oxygen \nextraction cannot compensate for the delivery deficit; hence, \noxygen consumption begins to decrease.

A standard 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will \ndetect 95% of ischemia, whereas a 12-lead ECG will \ndetect >98%.\nB. Lead V4 is the most sensitive for detecting periopera -\ntive ischemia.\nC. A standard 3-lead ECG will detect ischemia at the \nsame rate as a 12-lead ECG, however it is inferior at \nidentifying dysrhythmias.\nD. Lead V2 is the most sensitive for detecting periopera -\ntive ischemia.Answer: B\nContinuous monitoring of the 12-lead ECG may be beneficial \nin certain patient populations. In a study of 185 vascular surgi -\ncal patients, continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring was able to \ndetect transient myocardial ischemic episodes in 20.5% of the \npatients. This study demonstrated that the precordial lead V4, \nwhich is not routinely monitored on a standard 3-lead ECG, \nis the most sensitive for detecting perioperative ischemia and \ninfarction. To detect 95% of the ischemic episodes, two or \nmore precordial leads were necessary. Furthermore, in a pro -\nspective observational study, 51 peripheral artery vascular sur -\ngery patients underwent ambulatory continuous 12-lead ECG \nmonitoring in the postoperative setting. Ischemic load, defined \nas the area under the curve defined by ischemic ST-segment \ndeviation and ischemic time, was shown to predict periop -\nerative myocardial infarction with an area under the receiver \noperating characteristics curve of 0.87. Notably, ischemia was \nasymptomatic in 14 of the 17 identified patients, demonstrat -\ning value of this modality as a warning tool. Thus, continu -\nous 12-lead ECG monitoring may provide greater sensitivity \nthan 3-lead ECG for the detection of perioperative myocardial \nischemia, and may become standard for monitoring high-risk \nsurgical patients.

It is approximated by the systemic vascular resistance \nwhich is calculated by dividing mean arterial pres -\nsure by cardiac output.\nB. It is approximated by the right ventricular end-  \ndiastolic pressure as estimated with pulmonary artery \nocclusion pressure.\nC. It is approximated by the right ventricular end-  \ndiastolic pressure as estimated with central venous \npressure (CVP).\nD. It is approximated by the left ventricular end-  \ndiastolic pressure as estimated with pulmonary artery \nocclusion pressure.Answer: D\nStrictly speaking, preload is determined by end-diastolic vol -\nume (EDV). In practice, EDV is challenging to measure pre -\ncisely during the cardiac cycle, and so clinicians utilize the \nend-diastolic pressure (EDP) as a reasonable surrogate. For \nthe right ventricle, CVP approximates right ventricular EDP . \nFor the left ventricle, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure \n(PAOP), which is measured by transiently inflating a balloon \nat the end of a pressure monitoring catheter positioned in a \nsmall branch of the pulmonary artery, approximates left ven -\ntricular EDP . The presence of atrioventricular valvular steno -\nsis may alter this relationship.\nThere are limits to the utilization of EDP as a surrogate for \nEDV when evaluating preload. For example, EDP is deter -\nmined not only by volume but also by the diastolic compli -\nance of the ventricular chamber. Ventricular compliance is \naltered by various pathologic conditions and pharmacologic  2. Of the following parameters, which is the least influ -\nenced by an underdamped or overdamped intra-arterial \nblood pressure monitoring system?\nA. Systolic blood pressure\nB. Mean arterial blood pressure\nC. Diastolic blood pressure\nD. Pulse pressureAnswer: B\nIf the system is underdamped, then the inertia of the system, \nwhich is a function of the mass of the fluid in the tubing and \nthe mass of the diaphragm, causes overshoot of the points \nof maximum positive and negative displacement of the dia -\nphragm during systole and diastole, respectively. Thus, in an \nunderdamped system, systolic pressure will be overestimated \nand diastolic pressure will be underestimated. In an over -\ndamped system, displacement of the diaphragm fails to track \nthe rapidly changing pressure waveform, and systolic pressure \nwill be underestimated and diastolic pressure will be overes -\ntimated. It is important to note that even in an underdamped \nor overdamped system, mean pressure will be accurately \nrecorded, provided the system has been properly calibrated. \nFor these reasons, when using direct measurement of intra-\narterial pressure to monitor patients, clinicians should make \nclinical decisions based primarily on the measured mean \narterial blood pressure.

The relationship between EDP and end-diastolic \nvolume (EDV) can be changed with pharmacologic \nagents.\nD. EDP is often used as a surrogate for EDV because it is \neasier to approximate in the clinical setting.Answer: A\nStrictly speaking, preload is determined by EDV . In practice, \nEDV is challenging to measure precisely during the cardiac \ncycle, and so clinicians utilize the EDP as a reasonable sur -\nrogate. For the right ventricle, central venous pressure (CVP) \napproximates right ventricular EDP . For the left ventricle, \npulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), which is mea -\nsured by transiently inflating a balloon at the end of a pres -\nsure monitoring catheter positioned in a small branch of the \npulmonary artery, approximates left ventricular EDP . The \npresence of atrioventricular valvular stenosis may alter this \nrelationship.\nThere are limits to the utilization of EDP as a surrogate for \nEDV when evaluating preload. For example, EDP is deter -\nmined not only by volume but also by the diastolic compli -\nance of the ventricular chamber. Ventricular compliance is \naltered by various pathologic conditions and pharmacologic \nagents. Furthermore, the relationship between EDP and true \npreload is not linear, but rather is exponential (Fig. 13-2A,B). \nThis fact limits the utility of EDP as a surrogate marker at \nextremes of EDV .

In clinical practice, the Stewart-Hamilton \nequation is solved by a microprocessor.\nDetermination of cardiac output by the thermodilution \nmethod is generally quite accurate, although it tends to sys -\ntematically overestimate QT at low values. Changes in blood \ntemperature and QT during the respiratory cycle can influ -\nence the measurement. Therefore, results generally should be \nrecorded as the mean of two or three determinations obtained \nat random points in the respiratory cycle. Using cold injec -\ntate widens the difference between TB and TI and thereby \nincreases signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, most authorities \nrecommend using room temperature injectate (normal saline \nor 5% dextrose in water) to minimize errors resulting from \nwarming of the fluid as it transferred from its reservoir to a \nsyringe for injection.

In the initial derivation, Rothman and colleagues \ndemonstrated concordance of the RI with the Modified Early \nWarning Score (MEWS) system, which is designed to alert \nmedical teams to clinical deterioration that precedes cardiac \nor pulmonary arrest events. Subsequent publications evalu -\nated performance of the RI in predicting both readmission to \nsurgical ICUs in the postoperative setting as well as for rapid is digitally compressed while using a Doppler stethoscope to \nlisten for perfusion in the palmar arch vessels.\nAnother potential complication of intra-arterial monitor -\ning is retrograde embolization of air bubbles or thrombi into \nthe intracranial circulation. In order to minimize this risk \ncare should be taken to avoid flushing arterial lines when \nair is present in the system, and only small volumes of fluid  \n(<5 mL) should be employed for this purpose. Catheter-\nrelated infections can occur with any intravascular monitor -\ning device. However, catheter-related bloodstream infection \nis a relatively uncommon complication of intra-arterial lines \nused for monitoring, occurring in 0.4% to 0.7% of catheter -\nizations. The incidence increases with longer duration of arte -\nrial catheterization. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 435.)\nBrunicardi_Ch13_p105-114.indd   108 04/07/22   1:36 PM"

Defines PPV as the difference between the maxi -\nmal pulse pressure and the minimum pulse pressure \nobserved at different points in the respiratory cycle.\nD. Is unreliable in mechanically ventilated patients due \nto decreased venous return during inspiration.Answer: B\nWhen intrathoracic pressure increases during the applica -\ntion of positive airway pressure in mechanically ventilated \npatients, venous return decreases, and as a consequence, left \nventricular stroke volume (LVSV) also decreases. Therefore, \nPPV during a positive pressure episode can be used to predict  \nthe responsiveness of cardiac output to changes in preload. \nPPV is defined as the difference between the maximal pulse \npressure and the minimum pulse pressure divided by the \naverage of these two pressures (Fig. 13-4). This approach has \nvalidated this by comparing PPV , CVP , PAOP , and systolic \npressure variation as predictors of preload responsiveness in a \ncohort of critically ill patients. Patients were classified as being \n\u201cpreload responsive\u201d if their cardiac index increased by at least \n15% after rapid infusion of a standard volume of intravenous \nfluid.

Ppeak is measured at the end of inspiration.\nB. To measure Ppeak, the expiratory valve must be closed.\nC. Ppeak is independent of airway resistance, chest wall \ncompliance, and peak inspiratory flow.\nD. Ppeak is not routinely measured in mechanically venti -\nlated patients.Answer: A\nAirway pressures are routinely monitored in mechanically \nventilated patients. The peak airway pressure measured at \nthe end of inspiration (Ppeak) is a function of the tidal volume, \nthe resistance of the airways, lung/chest wall compliance, and \npeak inspiratory flow. The airway pressure measured at the \nend of inspiration when the inhaled volume is held in the \nlungs by briefly closing the expiratory valve is termed the pla -\nteau airway pressure  (Pplateau). As a static parameter, plateau \nairway pressure is independent of the airway resistance and \npeak airway flow and is related to the lung/chest wall com -\npliance and delivered tidal volume. Mechanical ventilators \nmonitor Ppeak with each breath and can be set to trigger an \nalarm if the Ppeak exceeds a predetermined threshold. Pplateau \nis not measured routinely with each delivered tidal volume \nbut rather is measured intermittently by setting the ventilator \nto close the exhalation circuit briefly at the end of inspira -\ntion and record the airway pressure when airflow is zero.

Reduced minute ventilation.Answer: D\nContinuous monitoring with capnography has become \nroutine during surgery under general anesthesia and for \nsome intensive care patients. A number of situations can be \npromptly detected with continuous capnography. A sudden \nreduction in P etco2 suggests either obstruction of the sam -\npling tubing with water or secretions, or a catastrophic event \nsuch as loss of the airway, airway disconnection or obstruc -\ntion, ventilator malfunction, or a marked decrease in QT. If \nthe airway is connected and patent and the ventilator is func -\ntioning properly, then a sudden decrease in P etco2 should \nprompt efforts to rule out cardiac arrest, massive pulmonary \nembolism, or cardiogenic shock. P etco2 can be persistently \nlow during hyperventilation or with an increase in dead space \nsuch as occurs with pulmonary embolization (even in the \nabsence of a change in QT). Causes of an increase in P etco2 \ninclude reduced minute ventilation or increased metabolic \nrate. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 447.) 12. Which of the following does not affect SaO2 (oxygen sat -\nuration of hemoglobin in arterial blood) in mechanically \nventilated patients?\nA. Mean airway pressure\nB. FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen)\nC. SvO2 (oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in venous \nblood)\nD. Respiratory rateAnswer: D\nDO2 is dependent to a greater degree on the oxygen satura -\ntion of hemoglobin (Hgb) in arterial blood (Sa O2) than on the \npartial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (Pa O2). DO2 also \nis dependent on QT and Hgb. As discussed earlier and illus -\ntrated mathematically by previous equations, the dissolved \noxygen in blood makes only a negligible contribution to DO2. \nSaO2 in mechanically ventilated patients depends on the mean \nairway pressure, the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi O2), and \nSvO2. Thus, when SaO2 is low, the clinician has only a lim -\nited number of ways to improve this parameter. The clinician \ncan increase mean airway pressure by increasing positive-end \nexpiratory pressure (PEEP) or inspiratory time. FiO2 can be \nincreased to a maximum of 1.0 by decreasing the amount of \nroom air mixed with the oxygen supplied to the ventilator. \nSvO2 can be increased by increasing Hgb or QT or decreas -\ning oxygen utilization (eg, by administering a muscle relaxant \nand sedation).

Excessive airway pressure and tidal volume adversely \naffect pulmonary and possibly systemic responses to critical \nillness. Subjecting the lung parenchyma to excessive pressure, \nknown as barotrauma, can result in parenchymal lung injury, \ndiffuse alveolar damage similar to ARDS, and pneumothorax, \nand can impair venous return and therefore limit cardiac out -\nput.

In the hypovolemic \nindividual, excessive pressure on the inferior vena cava and a \nreverse Trendelenburg position with loss of lower extremity \nmuscle tone may cause decreased venous return and decreased \ncardiac output. This is not seen in the normovolemic patient. \nThe most common arrhythmia created by laparoscopy is bra -\ndycardia. A rapid stretch of the peritoneal membrane often \ncauses a vasovagal response with bradycardia and, occasion -\nally, hypotension. The appropriate management of this event \nis desufflation of the abdomen, administration of vagolytic \nagents (eg, atropine), and adequate volume replacement.

A bolus is given at the end of the case. \nOne hour later, there is still low urine output. The appro -\npriate treatment is:\nA. Repeat bolus.\nB. Intravenous (IV) furosemide.\nC. Check urine electrolytes.\nD. Observe.Answer: D\nAlthough the effects of the pneumoperitoneum on renal \nblood flow are immediately reversible, the hormonally medi -\nated changes such as elevated antidiuretic hormone levels \ndecrease urine output for up to 1 hour after the procedure has \nended. Intraoperative oliguria is common during laparoscopy, \nbut the urine output is not a reflection of intravascular vol -\nume status; IV fluid administration during an uncomplicated \nlaparoscopic procedure should not be linked to urine output.

While performing a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplica -\ntion, during the transhiatal dissection the mediastinal \npleura is compromised and a CO2 pneumothorax devel -\nops. What is the initial preferred management of the \npneumothorax?\nA. Needle thoracostomy over the second intercostal \nspace, mid-clavicular line.\nB.

No intervention is needed. Continue with the planed \nprocedure.Answer: B\nWhen a pneumothorax occurs with laparoscopic Nissen fun -\ndoplication or Heller myotomy, it is preferable to place an \n18-French red rubber catheter with multiple side holes cut \nout of the distal end across the defect. At the end of the proce -\ndure, the distal end of the tube is pulled out a 10-mm port site \n(as the port is removed), and the pneumothorax is evacuated \nto a primitive water seal using a bowl of sterile water or saline. \nDuring laparoscopic esophagectomy, it is preferable to leave \na standard chest tube, as residual intra-abdominal fluid will \ntend to be siphoned through the defect postoperatively if the \ntube is removed at the end of the case. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \np. 456.)\n 5. During pneumoperitoneum, the increased intra-abdom -\ninal pressure directly and indirectly results in:\nA. Increased renal blood flow.\nB. Decreased urine output.\nC. Decreased levels of renin.\nD. Decreased sodium retention.Answer: B\nIncreased intra-abdominal pressure decreases renal blood \nflow, glomerular filtration rate, and urine output. These \neffects may be mediated by direct pressure on the kidney and \nthe renal vein. The secondary effect of decreased renal blood \nflow is to increase plasma renin release, thereby increasing \nsodium retention. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 456.)\n 6. Which type of radiofrequency electrosurgery mode has \nthe highest risk for thermal injury?\nA. Bipolar coagulation\nB. Monopolar coagulation\nC. Monopolar cutting\nD. Monopolar blendedAnswer: B\nA short-duration, high-voltage discharge of current (coagula -\ntion current) provides extremely rapid tissue heating. Lower-\nvoltage, higher-wattage current (cutting current) is better \nfor tissue desiccation and vaporization. When the surgeon \ndesires tissue division with the least amount of thermal injury \nand least coagulation necrosis, a cutting current is used.\nWith bipolar electrosurgery, the electrons flow between \ntwo adjacent electrodes. The tissue between the two elec -\ntrodes is heated and desiccated. There is little opportunity \nfor tissue cutting when bipolar current is used alone, but the \nability to coapt the electrodes across a vessel provides the best \nmethod of small-vessel coagulation without thermal injury to \nadjacent tissues. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 465.)Because insensible fluid losses through the open abdomen are \neliminated with laparoscopy, the need for supplemental fluid \nduring a laparoscopic surgical procedure should only keep \nup with venous pooling in the lower limbs, third-space losses \ninto the bowel, and blood loss, which is generally less than \noccurs with an equivalent open operation.

Open abdominal access (Hasson) is recommended \nversus direct puncture laparoscopy (Veress needle).\nC. The surgery should be performed during the second \ntrimester if possible.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nConcerns about the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy or \nappendectomy in the pregnant patient have been thoroughly \ninvestigated and are readily managed. Access to the abdo -\nmen in the pregnant patient should take into consideration \nthe height of the uterine fundus, which reaches the umbilicus \nat 20 weeks. In order not to damage the uterus or its blood \nsupply, most surgeons feel that the open (Hasson) approach \nshould be used in favor of direct puncture laparoscopy. The \npatient should be positioned slightly on the left side to avoid \ncompression of the vena cava by the uterus. Because preg -\nnancy poses a risk for thromboembolism, sequential com -\npression devices are essential for all procedures. Fetal acidosis \ninduced by maternal hypercarbia also has been raised as a \nconcern. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 473.)\nBrunicardi_Ch14_p115-118.indd   117 04/07/22   1:39 PM"

In the transcription of prokaryotes , binding of RNA \npolymerase to the specific promoter region is achieved \nby:\nA. Sigma factors\nB. Operon\nC. Elongation factors\nD. Rho factors 1. The process that occurs during translational control of \neukaryotic gene expression is:\nA. Protein degradation.\nB. RNA processing.\nC. Posttranslational control.\nD. Transcription.\nAnswer: A\nInitiation of transcription in prokaryotes (bacteria) begins \nwith the recognition of DNA sequences by RNA polymerase. \nFirst, the bacterial RNA polymerase catalyzes RNA synthesis \nthrough loose binding to any region in the double-stranded \nDNA and then through specific binding to the promoter  \nregion with the assistance of accessory proteins called \u03c3 fac -\ntors (sigma factors). A promoter region is the DNA region \nupstream of the transcription initiation site. RNA poly -\nmerase binds tightly at the promoter sites and causes the \ndouble-stranded DNA structure to unwind. Consequently, \nfew nucleotides can be base-paired with the DNA template to \nbegin transcription. Once transcription begins, the \u03c3 factor \nis released. The growing RNA chain may begin to peel off as \nthe chain elongates. This occurs in such a way that there are \nalways about 10 to 12 nucleotides of the growing RNA chains \nthat are base-paired with the DNA template. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., Figure 15-4, p. 483.)\n 3. All of the following transcription mechanisms occur in \neukaryotes EXCEPT:\nA. Chromatin structure changes to allow DNA to be \naccessible to the polymerase.\nB. Three separate RNA polymerases are involved.\nC. Proteins or initiation factors are not required.\nD. Often packaged with histone and nonhistone pro -\nteins into chromatins.Answer: C\nThe unique features of eukaryotic transcription are as follows: \n(a) Three separate RNA polymerases are involved in eukary -\notes: RNA polymerase I transcribes the precursor of 5.8S, 18S, \nand 28S rRNAs; RNA polymerase II synthesizes the precur -\nsors of mRNA as well as microRNA; and RNA polymerase \nIII makes tRNAs and 5S rRNAs. (b) In eukaryotes, the initial \ntranscript is often the precursor to final mRNAs, tRNAs, and \nrRNAs. The precursor is then modified and/or processed into \nits final functional form. RNA splicing is one type of process -\ning to remove the noncoding introns (the region between \ncoding exons) on an mRNA. (c) In contrast to bacterial DNA, \neukaryotic DNA often is packaged with histone and nonhis -\ntone proteins into chromatins. Transcription will only occur \nwhen the chromatin structure changes in such a way that CHAPTER 15\nMolecular and Genomic Surgery\nBrunicardi_Ch15_p119-126.indd   119 04/07/22   5:46 PM"

More than one triplet codes for the same amino acid.\nC. Codons are mRNA sequentially recognized by tRNA \nadaptor proteins.\nD. Protein synthesis proceeds in the carboxy-to-amino-\nterminus direction.Answer: D\nA codon , a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In \nthis case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7  \n4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes. Because 64 codes are more than enough \nfor 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than \none codon. The start codon is AUG, which also corresponds \nto methionine; therefore, almost all proteins begin with this \namino acid. The sequence of nucleotide triplets that follows \nthe start codon signal is termed the reading frame . The codons \non mRNA are sequentially recognized by tRNA adaptor pro -\nteins. Specific enzymes termed aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases  \nlink a specific amino acid to a specific tRNA. The translation \nof mRNA to protein requires the ribosomal complex to move \nstepwise along the mRNA until the initiator methionine \nsequence is identified. In concert with various protein initia -\ntor factors, the methionyl-tRNA is positioned on the mRNA \nand protein synthesis begins. Each new amino acid is added \nsequentially by the appropriate tRNA in conjunction with \nproteins called elongation factors . Protein synthesis proceeds \nin the amino-to-carboxy-terminus direction.

Proteins are variable-length polypep -\ntide polymers composed of various combinations of 20 dif -\nferent amino acids and are the working molecules of the cell. \nThe process of decoding information on mRNA to synthesize \nproteins is called translation (see Fig. 15-1). Translation takes \nplace in ribosomes composed of rRNA and ribosomal pro -\nteins. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 483.)DNA is accessible to the polymerase.

The gas pedal and brakes, respectively.\nC. The distributor and the spark plug, respectively.\nD. The windows and the tires, respectively.Answer: B\nThe cell cycle is connected with signal transduction pathways \nas well as gene expression. Although the S and M phases rarely \nare subjected to changes imposed by extracellular signals, the \nG1 and G2 phases are the primary periods when cells decide \nwhether to move on to the next phase. During the G1 phase, \ncells receive green- or red-light signals, S phase entry or G1 \narrest, respectively. Growing cells proliferate only when sup -\nplied with appropriate mitogenic growth factors. Cells become \ncommitted to entry of the cell cycle only toward the end of \nG1. Mitogenic signals stimulate the activity of early G1 CDKs \n(eg, cyclin D/CDK4) that inhibit the activity of pRb protein \nand activate the transcription factor called E2F to induce the \nexpression of batteries of genes essential for G1-S progression. \nMeanwhile, cells also receive antiproliferative signals such as \nthose from tumor suppressors. These antiproliferative signals \nalso act in the G1 phase to stop cells\u2019 progress into the S phase \nby inducing CKI production. For example, when DNA is dam -\naged, cells will repair the damage before entering the S phase. \nTherefore, G1 contains one of the most important checkpoints \nfor cell cycle progression. If the analogy is made that CDK is \nto a cell as an engine is to a car, then cyclins and CKI are the \ngas pedal and brake, respectively. Accelerated proliferation or \nimproper cell cycle progression with damaged DNA would be \ndisastrous. Genetic gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes \n(that often promote expression or activity of the cyclin/CDK \ncomplex) or loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppres -\nsor (that stimulate production of CKI) are causal factors for \nmalignant transformation.

All of the following are cell-surface receptors EXCEPT:\nA. Transmitter-gated ion channels.\nB. Seven-transmembrane-G-protein-coupled receptors.\nC. Enzyme-linked receptors.\nD. Adhesive receptors.Answer: D\nThere are three major classes of cell-surface receptors: trans -\nmitter-gated ion channels, seven-transmembrane G-protein\u2013\ncoupled receptors (GPCRs), and enzyme-linked receptors. \nThe superfamily of GPCRs is one of the largest families of \nproteins, representing over 800 genes of the human genome. \nMembers of this superfamily share a characteristic seven-\ntransmembrane configuration. The ligands for these receptors \nare diverse and include hormones, chemokines, neurotrans -\nmitters, proteinases, inflammatory mediators, and even sen -\nsory signals such as odorants and photons. Most GPCRs \nsignal through heterotrimeric G proteins, which are guanine \nnucleotide regulatory complexes. Thus the receptor serves \nas the receiver, the G protein serves as the transducer, and \nthe enzyme serves as the effector arm. Enzyme-linked recep -\ntors possess an extracellular ligand-recognition domain and a \ncytosolic domain that either has intrinsic enzymatic activity \nor directly links with an enzyme.

Dysregulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) \nsignaling is associated with all EXCEPT:\nA. Cancer.\nB. Inguinal hernias.\nC. Marfan syndrome.\nD. Thoracic aortic aneurysm.Answer: B\nResistance to TGF-\u03b2\u2019s anticancer action is one hallmark of \nhuman cancer cells. TGF-\u03b2 receptors and SMADs are identi -\nfied as tumor suppressors. The TGF-\u03b2 signaling circuit can \nbe disrupted in a variety of ways and in different types of \nhuman tumors. Some lose TGF-\u03b2 responsiveness through \ndownregulation or mutations of their TGF-\u03b2 receptors. The \ncytoplasmic SMAD4 protein, which transduces signals from \nligand-activated TGF-\u03b2 receptors to downstream targets, may \nbe eliminated through mutation of its encoding gene. The \nlocus encoding cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4B may be deleted. \nAlternatively, the immediate downstream target of its actions, \ncyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), may become unresponsive \nto the inhibitory actions of p15INK4B because of mutations \nthat block p15INK4B binding. The resulting cyclin D/CDK4 \ncomplexes constitutively inactivate tumor suppressor pRb by \nhyperphosphorylation. Finally, functional pRb, the end target \nof this pathway, may be lost through mutation of its gene. For \nexample, in pancreatic and colorectal cancers, 100% of cells \nderived from these cancers carry genetic defects in the TGF-\u03b2 \nsignaling pathway. Therefore, the antiproliferative pathway \nconverging onto pRb and the cell division cycle is, in one way or \nanother, disrupted in a majority of human cancer cells. Besides \ncancer, dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling also has been associ -\nated with other human diseases such as Marfan syndrome and \nthoracic aortic aneurysm.

The process of Northern hybridization \ninvolves several steps, as does Southern hybridization, includ -\ning electrophoresis of RNA samples in an agarose-formalde -\nhyde gel, transfer to a membrane support, and hybridization \nto a radioactively labeled DNA probe. Data from hybridiza -\ntion allow quantification of steady-state mRNA levels and, at \nthe same time, provide information related to the presence, \nsize, and integrity of discrete mRNA species. Thus, Northern \nblot analysis, also termed RNA gel blot analysis, commonly is \nused in molecular biology studies relating to gene expression. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 494.) 14. All of the following are correct about human embryonic \nstem cells (hESCs) EXCEPT:\nA. They are derived from early preimplantation \nembryos.\nB. They are derived from blastocysts.\nC. They can generate all differential germ layers.\nD. They are considered multipotent.Answer: D\nhESCs are derived from early preimplantation embryos \ncalled blastocysts  (5 days postfertilization) and are capable of \ngenerating all differentiated germ layers in the body by chi -\nmera assays or 2-D/3-D differentiation in a dish\u2014ectoderm, \nmesoderm, and endoderm\u2014and therefore are considered \npluripotent. There are two pluripotent states associated with \nhESCs, one of which is the classic culture with basic fibroblast \ngrowth factor (bFGF) and knock out replacer (KSR), termed \nas \u201cprimed\u201d pluripotent state. More recently, \u201cnaive\u201d hESC \nculture methods have been introduced based on mouse stud -\nies, by supplementing 2i inhibitors (MEK1 and GSK3\u03b2 inhib -\nitors) into the medium in addition to bFGF.

In normal cells, oncogenes promote cell growth by \nactivating cell cycle progression.\nB. In cancer cells, oncogenes promote cell growth by \nactivating cell cycle progression.\nC. Tumor suppressors enhance oncogene function.\nD. Oncogenes do not play an important role in main -\ntaining controlled state of cell growth.Answer: A\nThere are two classes of cancer genes in which alteration has \nbeen identified in human and animal cancer cells: oncogenes, \nwith dominant gain-of-function mutations, and tumor sup -\npressor genes, with recessive loss-of-function mutations. In \nnormal cells, oncogenes promote cell growth by activating \ncell cycle progression, whereas tumor suppressors counteract \noncogenes\u2019 functions. Therefore, the balance between onco -\ngenes and tumor suppressors maintains a well-controlled \nstate of cell growth.

Field has worked to define oncogene and nononco -\ngene addiction.\nB. It advances the understanding of discrimination \nbetween driver and passenger genes.\nC. The field made strides in appreciation of complexity \nof network interaction.\nD. The knowledge in the field has been effectively and \nreproducibly clinically translated.Answer: D\nOver the last 20 years, the field has worked to define onco -\ngene and nononcogene addiction, discriminate between \ndriver and passenger genes, and appreciate the complexity of \ncomplex, robust, network interactions. These insights have \nled to a preliminary understanding of therapeutically relevant \nsensitivity and resistance pathway signal patterns requiring \nmultiple  target modulation. However, this knowledge has not \nbeen effectively or reproducibly clinically translated. Clinical \nresponse is usually far greater when a combination of single-\ntarget molecular therapy is administered. However, it must \nalso be realized that targeting two or more pathways may also \nincrease the toxicity profile, particularly if target specificity is \nlimited. When attempted, off-target toxicity has been dem -\nonstrated with combination small-molecule therapy. In con -\ntrast, multitargeting bifunctional short hairpin (bi-shRNA) \nDNA vectors are designed to limit off-target effect given the \nhigh specificity for the genes they are designed to target.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to edit single \ngenes through gene knockout, mutation, and addi -\ntion of an epitope tag.\nB. A typical CRISPR region contains a cluster of DNA \nrepeats interspersed with spacers.\nC. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing involves DNA \nbreak and repair.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nCRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short pal -\nindromic repeats. It is a region on the genomic DNA first \ndiscovered in the microbes as an adapted immune system \nagainst exogenous DNA. A typical CRISPR region contains \na cluster of short (21\u201348 bp) DNA repeats (ranging from  \n2 to 100) interspaced by nonrepetitive sequences called  \nspacers. Within a CRISPR region, while each spacer has its \nunique sequence, the sequence of the repeats is highly con -\nserved. Several genes, called the CRISPR-associated (Cas) \ngenes, are almost always found directly flanking the CRISPR \nregion. Currently, CRISPR-Cas9 is most used for editing \nsingle genes, through gene knockout, gene mutation, or the \naddition of an epitope tag to a native gene, for functional char -\nacterization of the gene of interest. For example, oncogenes or \ntumor suppressor genes can be knocked out to identify the \ncausative gene for a particular cancer type; point mutations \nin functional domains may illustrate the mechanism of action \nof a protein; for proteins without available antibodies, epitope \ntags can be inserted onto the native gene for the detection of \nthe native protein.

GleevecAnswer: A.\nOne of the most exciting applications of immunotherapy has \ncome from the identification of certain tumor targets called \nantigens and the aiming of an antibody at these targets. This \nwas first used as a means of localizing tumors in the body \nfor diagnosis and was more recently used to attack cancer \ncells. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an example of such a drug. \nTrastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the \nmitogenic activity of cell-surface growth factor receptor HER-\n2, which is overexpressed in approximately 25% of breast \ncancers. HER-2\u2013overexpressing tumors tend to grow faster \nand generally are more likely to recur than tumors that do \nnot overproduce HER-2. Trastuzumab is designed to attack \ncancer cells that overexpress HER-2 by slowing or prevent -\ning the growth of these cells, resulting in increased survival \nof HER-2\u2013positive breast cancer patients.

The focus of ther -\nmal injury that has already undergone necrosis is known as \nthe zone of coagulation. Well outside the zone of coagulation \nis the zone of hyperemia, which exhibits signs of inflamma -\ntion but will likely remain viable.

Several retrospective \nstudies suggest that for melanoma in situ, 0.5 to 1 cm mar -\ngins are sufficient. 1-cm margins should be obtained in ana -\ntomically feasible areas given the possibility of an incidental \nfinding of a small invasive component in permanent sections. \nSeveral studies compared 1- to 3-cm margins and 2- to 5-cm \nmargins in melanoma <2 mm thick, and 2- to 4-cm margins \nin melanoma lesions 1 to 4 mm thick and found no differ -\nence.

Keratinocytes from the lining of epidermal appendagesAnswer: D\nThe stratum basale, or germinative layer, is a deep, single \nlayer of asynchronous, continuously replicating cuboidal to \ncolumnar epithelial cells and is the beginning of the life cycle \nof the keratinocytes of the epidermis. This layer is bound to \nits basement membrane by complexes made of keratin fila -\nments and anchoring structures called hemidesmosomes. \nThey are bound to other keratinocytes by structures called \ndesmosomes. High mitotic activity and thus large nuclei and \nbasophilic staining characterize the stratum basale on light \nmicroscopy.

Breslow depth 0.5 mm with superficial ulceration\nB. Clinically positive lymph nodes\nC. Breslow depth 1.5 mm without superficial ulceration\nD. Breslow depth 1.0 mm with lymphovascular invasionAnswer: B\nSLNB is a standard staging procedure to evaluate the \nregional nodes for patients with clinically node-negative \nmalignant melanoma. Detecting subclinical nodal metasta -\nsis may benefit from lymphadenectomy or adjuvant therapy. \nThis technique identifies the first draining lymph node from \nthe primary lesion and has shown excellent accuracy and sig -\nnificantly less morbidity compared to complete resection of \nnodal basins. It is almost always performed at the time of ini -\ntial wide excision, as SLN mapping after lymphatic violation \nfrom surgical excision could decrease the accuracy of the test. \nRecently, the results of MSLT-1, an international, multicenter, \nphase III trial were published. This study randomized clini -\ncally node negative patients to either SLNB at the time of pri -\nmary melanoma excision (and completion lymphadenectomy \nif positive) or nodal basin monitoring (and delayed complete \nlymphadenectomy for recurrent lymph node disease). The \nresults of this study demonstrated that SLNB, with immedi -\nate lymphadenectomy if positive, improved disease-free sur -\nvival by 7% and 10% in patients with intermediate thickness  \n(1.2\u20133.5 mm) and thick (>3.5 mm) lesions, respectively. The \nlatest NCCN guidelines suggest consideration of SLNB in \nclinically stage I/II patients with Breslow depth > 1.0 mm or \n>0.8 mm with high-risk features (ulceration, mitotic index  \n> 2/mm2, or lymphovascular invasion). A patient with clini -\ncally positive nodes would not be a candidate for screening \nSLNB. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 531.)\nBrunicardi_Ch16_p127-136.indd   132 30/06/22   11:21 AM"

What type of gland is typically influenced by sex hor -\nmones and undergoes a secretion process that involves \ndecapitation of the part of the cell?\nA. Hair follicle\nB. Sebaceous gland\nC. Apocrine sweat gland\nD. Eccrine sweat glandAnswer: C\nOne type of sweat gland, known as the apocrine sweat gland, \nis found around the axilla, anus, areola, eyelid, and external \nauditory canal. The cells in this gland undergo an excretion \nprocess that involves decapitation of part of the cell. These \napocrine glands are typically activated by sex hormones \nand thus activate around the time of puberty. The secretion \nfrom apocrine glands is initially odorless, but bacteria in the \nregion may cause an odor to develop. Pheromone produc -\ntion may have been a function of the apocrine glands, but this  \nmay now be vestigial.

Tissues with a higher metabolic \ndemand are typically susceptible to insult from tissue hypo -\nperfusion more rapidly than tissues with a lower metabolic \ndemand. Because of this, it is possible to have muscle necrosis \nbeneath cutaneous tissue that has yet to develop signs of irre -\nversible damage. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 523.)\n 18. Pressure-induced ischemia to cutaneous tissue resulting \nin nonblanching erythema with intact epidermis repre -\nsents which stage of injury?\nA.

They are typically grouped into four \nstages: stage I, nonblanching erythema over intact skin; stage II,  \npartial-thickness injury with blistering or exposed dermis; \nstage III, full-thickness injury extending down to, but not \nincluding, fascia and without undermining of adjacent tis -\nsue; and stage IV , full-thickness skin injury with destruction \nor necrosis of muscle, bone, tendon, or joint capsule. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 523.)been shown to significantly decrease the rate of infection. A \ncourse of 3 to 7 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically \nused. Alternatives are doxycycline or clindamycin with cipro -\nfloxacin. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 519.)\n 19. What type of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is \ncharacterized by a monomicrobial source of \u03b2-hemolytic \nStreptococcus  or Staphylococcus  species?\nA. Type I\nB. Type II\nC. Type III\nD. Type IVAnswer: B\nThere are three types of NSTIs when classified by the offend -\ning agent. The most common is type 1, which is caused by \na polymicrobial source including gram-positive cocci, gram-\nnegative rods, and anaerobic bacteria, specifically Clostridium \nperfringens  and C. septicum . Type 2 is caused by a monomi -\ncrobial source of \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus  or Staphylococcus   \nspecies, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  \n(MRSA) contributing to the increasing number of community-  \nacquired NSTIs. A history of trauma is often elicited and can \nbe associated with toxic shock syndrome. Type III is a rare \nbut fulminant subset resulting from a Vibrio vulnificus  infec -\ntion of traumatized skin exposed to a body of salt water.

What cystic lesion is a benign, congenital occurrence \ncaused by persistent epithelium across embryonic fusion \nlines, most commonly between the forehead and tip of \nthe nose?\nA. Trichilemmal cyst\nB. Epidermoid cyst\nC. Dermoid cyst\nD. NevusAnswer: C\nDermoid cysts are congenital variants that occur as the result \nof persistent epithelium within embryonic lines of fusion. \nThey occur most commonly between the forehead and nose \ntip, and the most frequent site is the eyebrow. They can lie \nin the subcutaneous tissue or intracranially, and often com -\nmunicate with the skin surface via a small fistula. These cys -\ntic structures contain epithelial tissue, hair, and a variety of \nepidermal appendages. Treatment for these cystic structures \nincludes surgical excision with care taken to remove the cyst \nlining to prevent recurrence. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 527.)\n 22. What subtype of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most \ncommon, characterized by raised, pearly pink papules \nwith telangiectasias and occasionally a depressed tumor \ncenter with raised borders?\nA. Micronodular\nB. Infiltrating\nC. Superficial spreading\nD. NodularAnswer: D\nThere are multiple variants of BCC, and presentation can \nrange from red, flesh-colored, or white macule or papule \nto nodules and ulcerated lesions. Growth patterns of these \nlesions can either be well-circumscribed or diffuse and  \nthe most common types of BCC are nodular and micronodu -\nlar, superficial spreading, and infiltrative. The most com -\nmon subtype is the nodular variant, characterized by raised, \npearly pink papules with telangiectasias and occasionally a \ndepressed tumor center with raised borders giving the clas -\nsic \u201crodent ulcer\u201d appearance. Superficial spreading BCC is \nconfined to the epidermis as a flat, pink, scaling or crusting \nlesion, often mistaken for eczema, actinic keratosis, fungal \ninfection, or psoriasis. This subtype typically appears on the \ntrunk or extremities and the mean age of diagnosis is 57 years. \nThe infiltrative form appears on the head and neck in the late \n60s, often at embryonic fusion lines, with an opaque yellow-\nwhite color that blends with surrounding skin and has no \nraised edges. The morpheaform subtype represents 2% to 3% \nof all BCC and is the most aggressive subtype. It usually pres -\nents as an indurated macule or papule with the appearance of \nan enlarging scar. The clinical margins are often indistinct, \nand the rate of positive margins after excision is high. There \nis also a pigmented variant of BCC that can be difficult to \ndistinguish from certain melanoma subtypes. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., pp. 528\u2013529.) 20. What subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) \nconfer the highest risk for malignancy?\nA. Types 16 and 18\nB. Types 6 and 11\nC. Types 6 and 8\nD. Types 3 and 4Answer: A\nMucosal HPV types cause lesions in the mucosal or genital \nareas and behave like sexually transmitted infections. The \nmost common mucosal types are HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, \nand -33. These lesions present as condylomata acuminata, \ngenital or veneral warts, papules that occur on the perineum, \nexternal genitalia, anus, and can extend into the mucosal sur -\nfaces of the vagina, urethra, and rectum. These lesions are at \nrisk for malignant transformation, with types 6 and 11 con -\nferring low risk, and types 16, 18, 31, and 33 conferring a high \nrisk. The recently developed quadrivalent HPV vaccine, tar -\ngeting HPV types -6, -11, -16, and -18, is now available to \nboth males and females age 9 to 26 and is associated with an \nup to 90% reduction of infections from those HPV types.

Actinic keratosis\nC. Congenital nevus\nD. AcrochordonsAnswer: B\nActinic keratoses are neoplasms of epidermal keratinocytes \nthat represent a range in a spectrum of disease from sun \ndamage to squamous cell carcinoma. They typically occur \nin fair-skinned, elderly individuals in primarily sun-exposed \nareas, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is the great -\nest risk factor. There are multiple variants, and they can pres -\nent as erythematous and scaly to hypertrophic, keratinized \nlesions. They can become symptomatic, causing bleeding, \npruritus, and pain. They can regress spontaneously, persist \nwithout change, and transform into invasive squamous cell \ncarcinoma. It is estimated that approximately 10% of actinic \nkeratoses will transform into invasive squamous cell carci -\nnoma, and that progression takes about 2 years on average. \nAbout 60% to 65% of squamous cell carcinomas are believed \nto originate from actinic keratoses.

Accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and \neosinophils within the breast\nB. Enlargement of breast alveoli\nC. Release of colostrum\nD. Accumulation of secretory products in minor duct \nluminaAnswer: C\nWith pregnancy, the breast undergoes proliferative and devel -\nopmental maturation. As the breast enlarges in response to \nhormonal stimulation, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosin -\nophils accumulate within the connective tissues. The minor \nducts branch and alveoli develop. Development of the alveoli \nis asymmetric, and variations in the degree of development \nmay occur within a single lobule. With parturition, enlarge -\nment of the breasts occurs via hypertrophy of alveolar epithe -\nlium and accumulation of secretory products in the lumina \nof the minor ducts. Alveolar epithelium contains abundant \nendoplasmic reticulum, large mitochondria, Golgi com -\nplexes, and dense lysosomes. Two distinct substances are pro -\nduced by the alveolar epithelium: (a) the protein component \nof milk, which is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum \n(exocrine secretion); and (b) the lipid component of milk \n(apocrine secretion), which forms as free lipid droplets in the \ncytoplasm. Milk released in the first few days after parturi -\ntion is called colostrum and has low lipid content but contains \nconsiderable quantities of antibodies.

Cytoplasmic mucoid globules are a distinctive cellular \nfeature.\nC. Frequency of LCIS cannot be reliably determined.\nD. The average age at diagnosis is 65 to 70 years.Answer: D\nLCIS originates from the terminal duct lobular units and \ndevelops only in the female breast. Cytoplasmic mucoid glob -\nules are a distinctive cellular feature. The frequency of LCIS in \nthe general population cannot be reliably determined because \nit usually presents as an incidental finding.

Correspondingly, factors that \nincrease the number of menstrual cycles, such as early men -\narche, nulliparity, and late menopause are associated with \nincreased risk.

The largest breast quadrant is the inner lower \nguardant.\nC. Vascular supply is via posterior intercostal arter -\nies, the internal mammary arteries, and the axillary \nartery.\nD. Cooper ligaments are only found in the upper quad -\nrants of the breast.Answer: C\nFibrous bands of connective tissue travel through the breast \n(Cooper suspension ligaments), insert perpendicularly into \nthe dermis, and promote structural support. The mature \nfemale breast extends from the level of the second or third \nrib to the inframammary fold to the sixth or seventh rib. It \nextends transversely from the border of the sternum to the \nanterior axillary line. The upper outer quadrant of the breast \ncontains a greater volume of tissue than the other quad -\nrants. The breast receives its principal blood supply from:  \n(a) perforating branches of the internal mammary artery;  \n(b) lateral branches of the posterior intercostal arteries; and  \n(c) branches from the axillary artery, including highest tho -\nracic, lateral thoracic, and pectoral branches of the thoracoac -\nromial artery.

Progesterone initiates ductal development.\nC. Prolactin is responsible for milk letdown.\nD. Oxytocin initiates contraction of myoepitherium.Answer: D\nEstrogen initiates ductal development, whereas progesterone \nis responsible for differentiation of epithelium and for lobu -\nlar development. Prolactin is the primary hormonal stimulus \nfor lactogenesis in late pregnancy and the postpartum period. \nOxytocin release is due to auditory, visual, and olfactory \nstimuli associated with nursing. Oxytocin initiates contrac -\ntion, which results in compression of alveoli and expulsion \nof milk into the lactiferous sinuses.

Twenty-five percent of women with BRCA mutation \nhave inherited the mutation from their fathers.Answer: B\nUp to 5% of breast cancers are caused by inheritance of germ -\nline mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are inher -\nited in an autosomal dominant fashion with varying degrees \nof penetrance. Data accumulated from the isolation of the \nBRCA1 gene suggest a role in cell cycle control and DNA \ndamage repair pathways. Female mutation carriers have been \nreported to have up to 85% lifetime risk for developing breast \ncancer. Unlike male carriers of BRCA1 mutations, men with \ngermline mutations in BRCA2 have an estimated breast can -\ncer risk of 6%, which represents a 100-fold increase over the \nrisk in general male population.

After 5- and 8-year follow-\nup periods, the disease-free, distance disease-free, and overall \nsurvival rates for lumpectomy with or without radiation ther -\napy were similar to those observed after total mastectomy. \nHowever, the incidence of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence \nwas higher in the group not receiving radiation therapy. For \nmost patients with early stage disease, reconstruction can be \nperformed immediately at the time of the mastectomy.

Ultraviolet light exposure.\nC. Plummer-Vinson syndrome.\nD. Reflux esophagitis.Answer: D\nHPV is an epitheliotropic virus that has been detected to various \ndegrees within samples of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. \nInfection alone is not considered sufficient for malignant con -\nversion; however, results of multiple studies suggest a role for \nHPV in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.  \nMultiple reports reflect that up to 40% to 60% of current diag -\nnoses of tonsillar carcinoma demonstrate evidence of HPV \ntypes 16 or 18. Environmental ultraviolet light exposure has \nbeen associated with the development of lip cancer. The pro -\njection of the lower lip, as it relates to this solar exposure, has \nbeen used to explain why the majority of squamous cell car -\ncinomas arise along the vermilion border of the lower lip. In \naddition, pipe smoking also has been associated with the devel -\nopment of lip carcinoma. Factors such as mechanical irritation, \nthermal injury, and chemical exposure have been described \nas an explanation for this finding. Other entities associated \nwith oral malignancy include Plummer-Vinson syndrome  \n(achlorhydria, iron-deficiency anemia, mucosal atrophy of \nmouth, pharynx, and esophagus), chronic infection with syph -\nilis, and immunocompromised status (30-fold increase with \nrenal transplant). (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 630.) 1. Which of the following statements are TRUE about leu -\nkoplakia of the vocal cords?\nA. Up to 40% risk of progression to invasive carcinoma.\nB. Ulceration is particularly suggestive of possible \nmalignancy.\nC. Initial therapy includes antihistamines.\nD. Biopsy should be considered only after 6 months of \nconservative therapy.Answer: B\nLeukoplakia of the vocal fold represents a white patch (which \ncannot be wiped off) on the mucosaI surface, usually on the \nsuperior surface of the true vocal cord. Rather than a diagnosis \nper se, the term leukoplakia describes a finding on laryngo -\nscopic examination. The significance of this finding is that it \nmay represent squamous hyperplasia, dysplasia, and/or car -\ncinoma. Lesions exhibiting hyperplasia have a 1% to 3% risk \nof progression to malignancy. In contrast, that risk is 10% to \n30% for those demonstrating dysplasia.\nFurthermore, leukoplakia may be observed in association \nwith inflammatory and reactive pathologies, including polyps, \nnodules, cysts, granulomas, and papillomas. Features of ulcer -\nation and erythroplasia are particularly suggestive of possible \nmalignancy. A history of smoking and alcohol abuse should \nalso prompt a malignancy work-up. In the absence of suspected \nmalignancy, conservative measures are used for 1 month. Any \nlesions that progress, persist, or recur should be considered for \nexcisional biopsy specimen.

Patient gender.Answer: D\nThe primary management of laryngeal cancer depends on a \nvariety of factors, including tumor extent, patient comorbidi -\nties, and surgeon/center experience. Stage-specific treatment \nrecommendations are not dependent on patient gender. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 641.) 5. Concerning head and neck malignancy, which of the fol -\nlowing is FALSE?\nA.

Zygoma fractures are typically displaced inferiorly \nand/or medially.\nC. Midface fractures are classified as Le Fort I, II, III, or IV .\nD. Temporal bone fractures, especially with cerebrospi -\nnal fluid (CSF) leakage, usually require open repair.Answer: B\nThe most common facial fracture involves the mandible; the \nmost common sites of mandibular fracture include the con -\ndyle (36%), body (35%), and angle (20%). Midface fractures \nare rarely isolated and include multiple subsites. However, \nisolated zygoma fractures are typically displaced inferiorly \nand medially with disruption of the suture lines between the \ntemporal, frontal, and maxillary bones and the zygoma. There \nare three classic patterns of more extensive mid face fractures: \nLe Fort I, II, and III. In patients with optic capsule involving \ntemporal bone fractures, typically caused by occipitomastoid \nimpact, sensorineural hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, and \nCSF leak are common. Regardless of the fracture pattern, \nwhen a CSF leak is suspected, it usually resolves with conser -\nvative management including bed rest, elevation of the head \nof the bed, stool softeners, and avoiding sneezing or straining. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 628.) 3. All of the following are TRUE about tracheostomy \nEXCEPT:\nA. Should be performed in patients anticipated to be \nintubated more than 2 weeks.\nB. Improves patient discomfort as compared to long-\nterm oropharyngeal intubation.\nC. Usually spontaneously close within 2 months of \nremoval.\nD. Does not obligate patient to loss of speech.Answer: C\nThe avoidance of prolonged orotracheal intubation decreases \nthe risk of laryngeal and subglottic injury and potential steno -\nsis, facilitates oral and pulmonary suctioning, and decreases \npatient discomfort. When the tracheostomy is no longer \nneeded, the tube is removed and closure of the opening usu -\nally occurs spontaneously over a 2-week period. Placement of \na tracheostomy does not obligate a patient to loss of speech. \nWhen a large-cuffed tracheostomy tube is in place, expect -\ning a patient to be capable of normal speech is impractical. \nHowever, after a patient is downsized to an uncuffed trache -\nostomy tube, intermittent finger occlusion or Pass-Muir valve \nplacement will allow a patient to communicate while using \nthe tracheostomy to bypass the upper airway.

Male gender.\nD. Excessive corticosteroid therapy.Answer: C\nIntubation-related risk factors include: prolonged intubation; \nhigh tracheostomy through the first tracheal ring or crico -\nthyroid membrane; transverse rather than vertical incision \non the trachea; oversized tracheostomy tube; prior tracheos -\ntomy or intubation; and traumatic intubation. Stenosis is also \nmore common in older patients, in females, after radiation, \nor after excessive corticosteroid therapy, and in the setting of \nconcomitant diseases such as autoimmune disorders, severe \nreflux disease, or obstructive sleep apnea and the setting of \nsevere respiratory failure. However, even a properly placed \ntracheostomy can lead to tracheal stenosis because of scar -\nring and local injury. Mild ulceration and stenosis are fre -\nquently seen after tracheostomy removal. Use of the smallest \ntracheostomy tube possible, rapid downsizing, and a vertical \ntracheal incision minimize the risk for posttracheostomy ste -\nnosis. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 663.) 2.

The cricoid cartilage \nconsists of an anterior arch and a posterior broad-based plate. \nArticulating with the posterior cricoid plate are the arytenoid \ncartilages. The vocal cords originate from the arytenoid car -\ntilages and then attach to the thyroid cartilage.

Type 1 pneumocytesThe lung can be conveniently viewed as two linked compo -\nnents: The tracheobronchial tree (or conducting airways \ncomponent) and the alveolar spaces (or gas exchange com -\nponent). The tracheobronchial tree consists of approximately  \n23 airway divisions to the level of the alveoli.

The grade of neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) that is \nassociated with hemoptysis, pneumonia, and tumor cells \narranged in cords and clusters is:\nA. Grade VI NEC.\nB. Grade IV NEC.\nC. Grade II NEC.\nD. Grade I NEC.Answer: D\nGrade I NEC (classic or typical carcinoid) is a low-grade \nNEC; 80% arise in the epithelium of the central airways. It \noccurs primarily in younger patients. Because of the central \nlocation, it classically presents with hemoptysis, with or with -\nout airway obstruction and pneumonia.

Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma --> Lepidic pre -\ndominate adenocarcinoma --> Adenocarcinoma in-\nsitu --> Invasive adenocarcinomaAnswer: A\nThe incidence of adenocarcinoma in the lung has increased \nover the last several decades and is now the most common \ntype of lung cancer. It occurs more frequently in females \nthan in males and is the most frequent histologic subtype in \nwomen, patients under the age of 45, and Asian populations.  \nAdenocarcinoma can be divided into mucinous and non-\nmucinous types. Based on consensus, the international working \ngroup proposed a multidisciplinary approach, with standard -\nized criteria and terminology for diagnosis in cytologic and \nsmall biopsy specimens, and routine molecular testing for \nknown mutations, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate \n(EGFR) and KRAS mutations. The new classification system \ndelineated a stepwise pathologic progression, from Atypical  \nadenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) to invasive adenocarci -\nnoma based on the predominant histologic growth patterns; \nthe terms bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and mixed subtype \nadenocarcinoma were eliminated in favor of more biologically \ndriven classification.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR)\nB. KRAS mutation\nC. AFP (Alpha feto protein)\nD. EML4-ALK fusion geneAnswer: C\nLung cancer management.\nRole of histologic diagnosis and molecular testing. Establish -\ning a clear histologic diagnosis early in the evaluation and \nmanagement of lung cancer is critical to effective treatment. \nMolecular signatures are also key determinants of treat -\nment algorithms for adenocarcinoma and will likely become \nimportant for squamous cell carcinoma as well. Currently, \ndifferentiation between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma in cytologic specimens or small biopsy specimens \nis imperative in patients with advanced stage disease, as treat -\nment with pemetrexed or bevacizumab-based chemotherapy \nis associated with improved progression-free survival in \npatients with adenocarcinoma but not squamous cell can -\ncer. Furthermore, life-threatening hemorrhage has occurred \nin patients with squamous cell carcinoma who were treated \nwith bevacizumab. Finally, EGFR mutation predicts response \nto EGFR tumor kinase inhibitors and is now recommended \nas first-line therapy in advanced adenocarcinoma. Because \nadequate tissue is required for histologic assessment and \nmolecular testing, each institution should have a clear, multi -\ndisciplinary approach to patient evaluation, tissue acquisition, \ntissue handling/processing, and tissue analysis (Fig. 19-4). \nIn many cases, tumor morphology differentiates adenocar -\ncinoma from the other histologic subtypes. If no clear mor -\nphology can be identified, then additional testing for one \nimmunohistochemistry marker for adenocarcinoma and one \nfor squamous cell carcinoma will usually enable differentia -\ntion. Immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine markers is \nreserved for lesions exhibiting neuroendocrine morphol -\nogy. Additional molecular testing should be performed on \nall adenocarcinoma specimens for known predictive and \nprognostic tumor markers (eg, EGFR, KRAS, and EML4-\nALK fusion gene). Ideally, use of tissue sections and cell  \nblock material is limited to the minimum necessary at each \ndecision point. This emphasizes the importance of a multi -\ndisciplinary approach; surgeons and radiologists must work \nin direct cooperation with the cytopathologist to ensure that \ntissue samples are adequate for morphologic diagnosis as well \nas providing sufficient cellular material to enable molecular \ntesting.

The most likely location of this tumor is:\nA. Left lower lobe central squamous cell carcinoma.\nB. Right upper lobe apical adenocarcinoma.\nC. Right lower lobe peripheral large cell carcinoma.\nD. Right middle lobe central squamous cell carcinoma.Answer: D\nNonpulmonary thoracic symptoms are often due to tumor \ninvasion into surrounding thoracic structures. This can lead \nto symptoms of Horner syndrome (Pancoast tumors), pericar -\ndial tamponade, back pain, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy \nleading to hoarseness and coughing. Phrenic nerve palsy is \ndue to invasion of a tumor into the phrenic nerve. The phrenic \nnerve traverses the hemithorax along the mediastinum, parallel \nand posterior to the superior vena cava and anterior to the pul -\nmonary hilum. Tumors at the medial lung surface or anterior \nhilum can directly invade the nerve; symptoms include referred \nshoulder pain, hiccups, and dyspnea with exertion because of \ndiaphragm paralysis. Radiographically, unilateral diaphragm \nelevation on chest radiograph is present. The diagnosis can be \nconfirmed by fluoroscopic examination of the diaphragm with \nparadoxical motion with breathing and sniffing, also known as \nthe \u201cSniff Test. \u201d (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 680.)\nBrunicardi_Ch19_p145-156.indd   149 04/07/22   1:51 PM"

If there is \nneuroendocrine (NE) morphology, the tumor may be classified as small cell carcinoma (SCLC) or non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), \nprobably large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) according to standard criteria (+ = positive, \u2212 = negative, and \u00b1 = positive or \nnegative). If there is no clear ADC or SQCC morphology, the tumor is regarded as NSCLC -not otherwise specified (NOS). Step 2: NSCLC-NOS \ncan be further classified based on (a) immunohistochemical stains, (b) mucin (DPAS or mucicarmine) stains, or (c) molecular data. If the stains \nall favor ADC-positive ADC marker(s) (ie, TTF-1 and/or mucin positive) with negative SQCC markers, then the tumor is classified as NSCLC, \nfavor ADC. If SQCC markers (ie, p63 and/or CK5/6) are positive with negative ADC markers, the tumor is classified as NSCLC, favor SQCC. If \nthe ADC and SQCC markers are both strongly positive in different populations of tumor cells, the tumor is classified as NSCLC-NOS, with a \ncomment it may represent adenosquamous carcinoma.

A 57-year-old non-small -cell lung cancer patient with a \npotentially resectable tumor found on CT scan who can \nwalk on a flat surface indefinitely without oxygen or stop -\nping to rest, secondary to dyspnea will most likely tolerate:\nA. Lobectomy.\nB. Pneumonectomy.\nC. Single-lung ventilation.\nD. Wedge resection.Answer: A\nAssessment of functional status. Patients with potentially \nresectable tumors require careful assessment of their func -\ntional status and ability to tolerate either lobectomy or pneu -\nmonectomy. The surgeon should first estimate the likelihood \nof pneumonectomy, lobectomy, or possibly sleeve resection, \nbased on the CT images. A sequential process of evaluation \nthen unfolds. A patient\u2019s history is the most important tool \nfor gauging risk. Specific questions regarding performance \nstatus should be routinely asked. If the patient can walk on a \nflat surface indefinitely, without oxygen and without having \nto stop and rest secondary to dyspnea, he will be very likely \nto tolerate lobectomy. If the patient can walk up two flights \nof stairs (up two standard levels), without having to stop and \nrest secondary to dyspnea, she will likely tolerate pneumo -\nnectomy. Finally, nearly all patients, except those with carbon \ndioxide (CO2) retention on arterial blood gas analysis, will be \nable to tolerate periods of single-lung ventilation and wedge \nresection. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 691.) 11. Evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy by noninva -\nsive imaging is best performed by which of the following \nmodalities?\nA. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan\nB. CT scan\nC. MRI(magnetic resonance imaging)\nD. PET-CTAnswer: D\nMediastinal lymph node staging by PET scanning appears \nto have greater accuracy than CT scanning. PET staging of \nmediastinal lymph nodes has been evaluated in two meta-\nanalyses. The overall sensitivity for mediastinal lymph node \nmetastasis was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76%\u201382%), \nwith a specificity of 91% (95% CI 89%\u201393%) and an accuracy \nof 92% (95% CI 90%\u201394%). In comparing PET with CT scans \nin patients who also underwent lymph node biopsies, PET \nhad a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 91%, whereas CT \nscanning had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 76%. \nCombining CT and PET scanning may lead to even greater \naccuracy. In one study of CT, PET, and mediastinoscopy in \n68 patients with potentially operable NSCLC, CT correctly \nidentified the nodal stage in 40 patients (59%). It understaged \nthe tumor in 12 patients and overstaged it in 16 patients. PET \ncorrectly identified the nodal stage in 59 patients (87%). It \nunderstaged the tumor in five patients and overstaged it in \nfour. For detecting N2 and N3 disease, the combination of \nPET and CT scanning yielded a sensitivity, specificity, and \naccuracy of 93%, 95%, and 94%, respectively. CT scan alone \nyielded 75%, 63%, and 68%, respectively. Studies examining \ncombined PET-CT consistently show improved accuracy \ncompared to PET or CT alone; accuracy for PET-CT nodal \npositivity confirmed by mediastinoscopy is approximately \n75%, with a negative predictive value of approximately 90%. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 687.)\nBrunicardi_Ch19_p145-156.indd   151 04/07/22   1:51 PM"

A 45-year-old man with 20 pack-year history of smok -\ning is diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the \nright middle lobe. Clinically the patient has symptoms of \nhoarseness and coughing when drinking liquids. The T \nstaging for this tumor is:\nA. T2a.\nB. T2b.\nC. T3.\nD. T4.Answer: D\nThe staging of solid epithelial tumors is based on the TNM \nstaging system. The primary tumor \u201cT\u201d status provides \ninformation about tumor size and relationship to surround -\ning structures; the \u201cN\u201d status provides information about \nregional lymph nodes; and the \u201cM\u201d status provides informa -\ntion about the presence or absence of metastatic disease. The \ndesignation of lymph nodes as N1, N2, or N3 requires famil -\niarity with the lymph node mapping system. Based on clearly \ndelineated anatomic boundaries, accurate and reproducible \nlocalization of thoracic lymph nodes is possible, facilitating \ndetailed nodal staging for individual patients and standard -\nization of nodal assessment between surgeons. In the case \ndescribed, the patient\u2019s symptoms of dysphagia and hoarseness \nsuggests involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which \nconfers him a T4 designation in the TNM classification system.  \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 689.)\n TABLE 19-1    Indications for surgical drainage procedures \nfor lung abscesses\n1.

Patients with resectable tumors require assessment of \ntheir pulmonary functional status to determine if they \nare able to tolerate surgical resection. The two most reli -\nable predictors of pulmonary functional capacity are:\nA. FEV1 and DLCO.\nB. RV and TLC.\nC. RV and DLCO.\nD. FEV1 a n d  RV.Answer: A\nPulmonary function studies are routinely performed when \nany resection greater than a wedge resection will be per -\nformed. Of all the measurements available, the two most \nvaluable are forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and \ncarbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO). General guide -\nlines for the use of FEV1 in assessing the patient\u2019s ability to tol -\nerate pulmonary resection are as follows: Greater than 2.0 L  \ncan tolerate pneumonectomy, and >1.5 L can tolerate lobec -\ntomy. It must be emphasized that these are guidelines only. It \nis also important to note that the raw value is often imprecise \nbecause normal values are reported as \u201cpercent predicted\u201d \nbased on corrections made for age, height, and gender. Nota -\nbly it is not uncommon to encounter patients with significant \nreductions in FEV1 and DLCO that are inconsistent with the \npatient\u2019s functional status. In these patients, exercise testing \nthat yields maximal oxygen consumption (V.O2max) has emerged \nas a valuable decision-making technique to help patients \nwith abnormal FEV1 and DLCO.

Urban residents.\nD. HIV infection.Answer: D\nEpidemiology . Tuberculosis is a widespread problem that \naffects nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population. Between \n8.3 and 9 million new cases of tuberculosis and 12 million \nprevalent cases (range 10\u201313 million) were estimated world -\nwide in 2011 according to the World Health Organization. \nOnly 10,521 new cases were reported to the World Health \nOrganization in the United States in 2011. HIV infection is \nthe strongest risk factor for developing active tuberculosis. \nThe elderly, minorities, and recent immigrants are the most \ncommon populations to have clinical manifestations of infec -\ntion, yet no age group, sex, or race is exempt from infection. \nIn most large urban centers, reported cases of tuberculosis are \nmore numerous among the homeless, prisoners, and drug-\naddicted populations. Immunocompromised patients addi -\ntionally contribute to an increased incidence of tuberculosis \ninfection, often developing unusual systemic as well as pul -\nmonary manifestations. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 710.)\n 18. The fungi associated with the highest mortality rate due \nto invasive mycoses in the United States is:\nA. Aspergillus .\nB. Cryptococcus .\nC. Candidia .\nD. Mucor .Answer: A\nAspergillosis . The genus Aspergillus  comprises over 150 species  \nand is the most common cause of mortality due to invasive \nmycoses in the United States. It is typically acute in onset \nand life-threatening and occurs in the setting of neutropenia, \nchronic steroid therapy, or cytotoxic chemotherapy. It can also \noccur in the general intensive care unit population of critically ill \npatients, including patients with underlying chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD), postoperative patients, patients \nwith cirrhosis or alcoholism, and postinfluenza patients, with -\nout any of these factors present. The species most commonly \nresponsible for clinical disease include A. fumigatus , A. flavus , \nA. niger , and A. terreus . Aspergillus  is a saprophytic, filamen -\ntous fungus with septate hyphae. Spores (2.5\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter) \nare released and easily inhaled by susceptible patients; because \nthe spores are microns in size, they are able to reach the distal  \nbronchi and alveoli. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 711.) 16. The most likely cause of aspiration pneumonia is:\nA. A mixture of aerobes and anaerobes.\nB. Aerobes only.\nC. Anaerobes only.\nD. Gram-negative bacteria.Answer: C\nMicrobiology. Normal oropharyngeal secretions con -\ntain many more Streptococcus  species and more anaer -\nobes (approximately 1 \u00d7 108 organisms/mL) than aerobes  \n(approximately 1 \u00d7 107organisms/mL). Pneumonia that fol -\nlows from aspiration, with or without abscess development, \nis typically polymicrobial. An average of two to four iso -\nlates present in large numbers have been cultured from lung \nabscesses sampled percutaneously. Overall, at least 50% of \nthese infections are caused by purely anaerobic bacteria, 25% \nare caused by mixed aerobes and anaerobes, and 25% or fewer \nare caused by aerobes only. In nosocomial pneumonia, 60% to \n70% of the organisms are gram-negative bacteria, including \nKlebsiella pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Proteus  spe-\ncies, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Enterobacter \ncloacae , and Eikenella corrodens . Immunosuppressed patients \nmay develop abscesses because of the usual pathogens as well \nas less virulent andopportunistic organisms such as Salmo -\nnella  species, Legionella  species, Pneumocystis carinii , atypical \nmycobacteria, and fungi.

Fibrous dysplasia.Answer: A\nChondroma . Chondromas, seen primarily in children and \nyoung adults, are one of the more common benign tumors of \nthe chest wall. They usually occur at the costochondral junc -\ntion anteriorly and may be confused with costochondritis, \nexcept that a painless mass is present. Radiographically, lesion \nis lobulated and radiodense; it may have diffuse or focal cal -\ncifications; and it may displace the bonycortex without pen -\netration. Chondromas may grow to huge sizes if left untreated.  \nTreatment is surgical resection with a 2-cm margin. Large \nchondromas may harbor well-differentiated chondrosarcoma \nand should be managed with a 4-cm margin to prevent local \nrecurrence. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 722.)\n 21. An \u201conion-peel\u201d appearance of a rib on computed \ntomography is suggestive of:\nA. Chondroma.\nB. Ewing sarcoma.\nC. Plasmacytoma.\nD. Osteosarcoma.Answer: B\nPrimitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) and Ewing sar -\ncoma. PNETs (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and \nganglioneuromas) derive from primordial neural crest cells \nthat migrate from the mantle layer of the developing spinal \ncord. Histologically, PNETs and Ewing sarcomas are small, \nround cell tumors; both possess a translocation between the \nlong arms of chromosomes 11 and 22 within their genetic \nmakeup. They also share a consistent pattern of proto-  \noncogene expression and have been found to express the \nproduct of the MIC2 gene. Ewing sarcoma occurs in adoles -\ncents and young adults who present with progressive chest \nwall pain, but without the presence of a mass. Systemic symp -\ntoms of malaise and fever are often present. Laboratory stud -\nies reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and \nmild white blood cell elevation.\nRadiographically, the characteristic onion peel appearance \nis produced by multiple layers of periosteum in the bone for -\nmation. Evidence of bony destruction is also common. The \ndiagnosis can be made by a percutaneous needle biopsy or an \nincisional biopsy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 725.)\n 22. Desmoid tumors are associated with which of the follow -\ning gene?\nA. KRAS\nB. RET\nC. P53\nD. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)Answer: D\nDesmoid tumors.  Soft tissue neoplasms arising from fascial \nor musculoaponeurotic structures, desmoid tumors consist \nof proliferations of benign appearing fibroblastic cells, abun -\ndant collagen, and few mitoses. Desmoid tumors possess \nalterations in the APC/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Cyclin D1 dys -\nregulation is thought to play a significant role in their patho -\ngenesis. Associations with other diseases and conditions are \nwell documented, especially those with similar alterations in \nthe APC pathway, such as familial adenomatous polyposis \n(Gardner syndrome). Other conditions with increased risk of \ndesmoid tumor formation include increased estrogen states \n(pregnancy) and trauma. Surgical incisions (abdominal and \nthorax) have been the site of desmoid development, either in \nor near the scar. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 722.) 19. Previously, patients with severe primary pulmonary \nhypertension were listed for lung transplantation due to \nrespiratory failure. The use of the following medication \nhas significantly altered the need for transplantation:\nA. Epoprostenol.\nB. Midodrine.\nC. Dobutamine.\nD. Nitrates.Answer: A\nCurrently, virtually all patients with primary pulmonary hyper -\ntension are now treated with intravenous epoprostenol. Prosta -\ncyclin is a member of the endogenous prostanoid family and is \nproduced from arachidonic acid by the enzymes prostacyclin \nsynthase and cyclooxygenase (COX). It acts to increase pul -\nmonary vasodilation within the lungs. Espoprostenol must be \ngiven by continuous infusion.

A teratoma.\nB. A nonseminomatous germ-cell tumor.\nC. A seminomatous germ-cell tumor.\nD. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.Answer: B\nThe use of serum markers to evaluate a mediastinal mass can \nbe invaluable in some patients. For example, nonseminomatous \nand seminomatous germ-cell tumors can frequently be diag -\nnosed and often distinguished from one another by the levels of \n\u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). \nIn >90% of nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors, either the \nAFP or the hCG level will be elevated. Results are close to 100% \nspecific if the level of either AFP or hCG is >500 ng/mL. Some \ncenters institute chemotherapy based on this result alone, with -\nout biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis. In contrast, the AFP \nlevel in patients with mediastinal seminoma is always normal; \nonly 10% will have elevated hCG, which is usually <100 ng/mL.  \nOther serum markers, such as intact parathyroid hormone level \nfor ectopic parathyroid adenomas, may be useful for diagnos -\ning and also for intraoperatively confirming complete resection. \nAfter successful resection of a parathyroid adenoma, this hor -\nmone level should rapidly normalize.

FibrosarcomaAnswer: C\nThe most common tumor of the anterior mediastinum is \nthymoma. Thymomas are histologically characterized by a \nmixture of epithelial cells and mature lymphocytes. Grossly \nthey are well encapsulated. Between 10% and 50% of patients \nwith thymoma will have symptoms suggestive of myasthenia \ngravis or have circulating antibodies to acetylcholine recep -\ntors. Most patients with thymomas are asymptomatic. Thy -\nmectomy leads to improvement or resolution of symptoms \nof myasthenia gravis in only about 25% of patients with thy -\nmomas. In contrast, in patients with myasthenia gravis and \nno thymoma, thymectomy results are superior: up to 50% of \npatients have a complete remission, and 90% improve. In 5% \nof patients with thymomas, other paraneoplastic syndromes, \nincluding red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, systemic \nlupus erythematosus, Cushing syndrome, or SIADH, may be \npresent. Large thymic tumors may present with symptoms \nrelated to a mass effect, which may include cough, chest pain, \ndyspnea, or SVC syndrome. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 730.) 23. Eosinophilic granulomas are associated with:\nA. Langerhans cell histiocytosis.\nB. Parasitic infections.\nC. Crohn disease.\nD. Gardner syndrome.Answer: A\nEosinophilic granulomas are benign osteolytic lesions. Eosin -\nophilic granulomas of the ribs can occur as solitary lesions or \nas part of a more generalized disease process of the lympho -\nreticular system termed Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). \nIn LCH, the involved tissue is infiltrated with large numbers \nof histiocytes (similar to Langerhans cells seen in skin and  \nother epithelia), which are often organized as granulomas. The \ncause is unknown. Of all LCH bone lesions, 79% are solitary \neosinophilic granulomas, 7% involve multiple eosinophilic \ngranulomas, and 14% belong to other forms of more systemic \nLCH. Isolated single eosinophilic granulomas can occur in the \nribs or skull, pelvis, mandible, humerus, and other sites. They \nare diagnosed primarily in children between the ages of 5 and \n15 years. Because of the associated pain and tenderness, they \nmay be confused with Ewing sarcoma or with an inflamma -\ntory process such as osteomyelitis. Healing may occur sponta -\nneously, but the typical treatment is limited surgical resection \nwith a 2-cm margin.

Smoking.\nC. Age > 40.\nD. Male gender.Answer: B\nMalignant mesothelioma is the most common type of pri -\nmary tumor of the pleura, with approximately 3000 cases per \nyear in the United States. Other, less common tumors include \nbenign and malignant fibrous tumors of the pleura, lipomas, \nand cysts. The only known risk factor for mesothelioma is \nexposure to asbestos, identified in >50% of cases. Exposure \nis typically work-related in industries using asbestos in the \nmanufacturing process, such as shipbuilding and brake pad \nlinings. The risk extends to family members who are exposed \nto the dust of the clothing or to the work environment.

Balloon valvotomy\nB. Intubation and initiation of prostaglandin\nC. Surgical valvotomy\nD. Norwood procedureAnswer: A\nThe first decision that must be made in the neonate with \ncritical left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is \nwhether the patient is a candidate for biventricular or univen -\ntricular repair. Central to this decision is assessment of the \ndegree of hypoplasia of the LV and other left-sided structures. \nAlsoufi and colleagues have described a rational approach to \nthe neonate with critical LVOT obstruction. The options vary \ndepending on whether the infant follows a single or a biven -\ntricular pathway. The options for a single ventricle include the \nNorwood operation, a hybrid strategy (initial ductal stent and \nbilateral pulmonary artery bands followed by later comple -\ntion of the Norwood operation) or heart transplantation. The \noptions for a biventricular heart include balloon valvuloplasty, \nsurgical valvotomy, neonatal Ross operation, or a Y asui oper -\nation. Often valvotomy is accompanied by LV rehabilitation \ntechniques, including endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) resec -\ntion and mitral valve interventions. Fetal aortic valvotomy, \nwhich is now offered at specialized centers, is another prom -\nising strategy to decompress the LV in fetal life and potentially \nallow growth of the left-sided structures sufficient to permit \na biventricular circulation. Regardless of whether the baby is \ntriaged to a single or biventricular strategy, any infant with \nsevere aortic stenosis (AS) requires urgent intervention. Pre -\noperative stabilization, however, has dramatically altered the \nclinical algorithm and outcomes for this patient population. \nThe preoperative strategy begins with endotracheal intuba -\ntion and inotropic support. Prostaglandin infusion is initi -\nated to maintain ductal patency, and confirmatory studies are \nperformed prior to operative intervention. Therapy is gener -\nally indicated in the presence of a transvalvular gradient of  \n50 mm Hg with associated symptoms including syncope, con -\ngestive heart failure (CHF), or angina, or if a gradient of 50 to  \n75 mm Hg exists with concomitant electrocardiography \n(ECG) evidence of LV strain or ischemia. In the critically ill \nneonate, a gradient across the aortic valve may not be present \nbecause of poor LV function. However, the decision regarding \ntreatment options must be based on a complete understanding  2. The most common age to close asymptomatic atrial sep -\ntal defects (ASDs) is:\nA. In the immediate newborn period.\nB. After the child reaches 10 kg in weight.\nC. Age 4\u20135 years.\nD.

Children of this size can usually be operated on \nwithout the use of blood transfusion and have excellent out -\ncomes. Patients who are symptomatic may require repair ear -\nlier, even in infancy. Some surgeons advocate routine repair \nin infants and children especially in cases where prematurity-\nrelated lung disease may accelerate damage to the pulmonary \nvascular bed, though this philosophy may not be widespread. \nIn a review by Reddy and colleagues, 116 neonates weighing \nless than 2500 g who underwent repair of simple and complex \ncardiac defects with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass were \nfound to have no intracerebral hemorrhages, no long-term \nneurologic sequelae, and a low operative mortality rate (10%). \nThese results correlated with the length of cardiopulmonary \nbypass and the complexity of repair. These investigators also \nfound an 80% actuarial survival at 1 year and, more impor -\ntantly, that growth following complete repair was equivalent \nto weight-matched neonates free from cardiac defects.

At the level of the renal arteries.Answer: B\nCoarctation of the aorta (COA) is defined as a luminal nar -\nrowing in the aorta that causes an obstruction to blood flow. \nThis narrowing is most commonly located distal to the left \nsubclavian artery. The embryologic origin of COA is a sub -\nject of some controversy. One theory holds that the obstruct -\ning shelf, which is largely composed of tissue found within \nthe ductus, forms as the ductus involutes. The other theory \nholds that a diminished aortic isthmus develops secondary to \ndecreased aortic flow in infants with enhanced ductal circula -\ntion.

Coarctation of the aortaAnswer: C\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) \noccurs in 1% to 2% of all cardiac malformations and is charac -\nterized by abnormal drainage of the pulmonary veins into the \nright heart, whether through connections into the right atrium \nor into its tributaries. Accordingly, the only mechanism by \nwhich oxygenated blood can return to the left heart is through \nan ASD, which is almost uniformly present with TAPVC.\nUnique to this lesion is the absence of a definitive form \nof palliation.

There are \nseveral modifications of this anastomosis, most notably the \nDamus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) anastomosis, which involves \ndividing both the aorta and the pulmonary artery at the sino -\ntubular junction.

In patients presenting \nlater than 2 weeks, the LV can be retrained with preliminary \npulmonary artery banding and aortopulmonary shunt fol -\nlowed by definitive repair.

Which of the following is NOT one of the components of \nthe tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)?\nA. Atrial septal defect\nB. Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\nC. Right ventricular hypertrophy\nD. Right ventricular outflow obstructionAnswer: A\nThe original description of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) by \nEttienne Louis Fallot, as the name implies, included four \nabnormalities: a large perimembranous VSD adjacent to the \ntricuspid valve; an overriding aorta; a variable degree of right \nventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, which might \ninclude hypoplasia and dysplasia of the pulmonary valve as \nwell as obstruction at the subvalvar and pulmonary artery \nlevel; and right ventricular hypertrophy. More recently, the \nVan Praagh et al pointed out that TOF could be more cor -\nrectly termed monology of Fallot, since the four components \nare explained by the malposition of the infundibular septum. \nWhen the infundibular septum is displaced anteriorly and \nleftward, the RVOT is narrowed and its anterior displacement \nresults in failure of fusion of the ventricular septum between \nthe arms of the trabeculo-septo-marginalis. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 784.)innominate artery to the right pulmonary artery.

Lack of electrocardiogram changesAnswer: B\nVSDs may close or narrow spontaneously, and the probability \nof closure is inversely related to the age at which the defect is \nobserved. Thus, infants at 1 month of age have an 80% inci -\ndence of spontaneous closure, whereas a child at 12 months \nof age has only a 25% chance of closure. This has an impor -\ntant impact on operative decision-making because a small or \nmoderate-size VSD may be observed for a period of time in \nthe absence of symptoms. Large defects and those in severely \nsymptomatic neonates should be repaired during infancy to \nrelieve symptoms and because irreversible changes in pulmo -\nnary vascular resistance may develop during the first year of \nlife.

Left and right ventricular pressure and size of the \ndefect.\nC. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and \ndefect size.\nD. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance.Answer: C\nThe size of the VSD determines the initial pathophysiology \nof the disease. Large VSDs are classified as nonrestrictive and \nare at least equal in diameter to the aortic annulus. These \ndefects allow free flow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) to \nthe right ventricle (RV), elevating right ventricular pressures \nto the same level as systemic pressure.\nConsequently, the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp to \nQs) is inversely dependent on the ratio of pulmonary vascular \nresistance to systemic vascular resistance. Nonrestrictive VSDs \nproduce a large increase in pulmonary blood flow, and the \nafflicted infant will present with symptoms of congestive heart \nfailure. However, if untreated, these defects will cause pulmo -\nnary hypertension with a corresponding increase in pulmonary \nvascular resistance. This will lead to a reversal of flow (a right-\nto-left shunt), which is known as Eisenmenger syndrome.\nSmall restrictive VSDs offer significant resistance to the \npassage of blood across the defect, and therefore right ven -\ntricular pressure is either normal or only minimally elevated \nand the ratio of Qp to Qs rarely exceeds 1.5. These defects \nare generally asymptomatic because there are few physiologic \nconsequences. However, there is a long-term risk of endo -\ncarditis because endocardial damage from the jet of blood \nthrough the defect may serve as a possible nidus for coloniza -\ntion.

Cyanosis, \nhemoptysis, and pneumonia are not anticipated. With the \nvolume overloading in the right ventricle, ventricular dila -\ntation is more common than ventricular hypertrophy.

These changes result \nin increased sympathetic discharge, tachycardia, tachypnea, \nand ventricular hypertrophy. The diastolic shunt results in \nlower aortic diastolic pressure and increases the potential for \nmyocardial ischemia and underperfusion of other systemic \norgans, while the increased pulmonary flow leads to increased \nwork of breathing and decreased gas exchange.

The open approach employs a muscle-\nsparing posterior lateral thoracotomy in the third or fourth \nintercostal space on the side of the aorta (generally the left). \nThe lung is then retracted anteriorly.

In this case, division between \nvascular clamps with oversewing of both ends is advisable.

AortoventriculoplastyAnswer: A\nSubvalvular aortic stenosis (AS) occurs beneath the aortic \nvalve and may be classified as discrete or tunnel-like (diffuse). \nA thin, fibromuscular diaphragm immediately proximal to \nthe aortic valve characterizes discrete subaortic stenosis. This \ndiaphragm typically extends for 180\u00b0 or more in a crescen -\ntic or circular fashion, often attaching to the mitral valve as \nwell as the interventricular septum. The aortic valve itself is \nusually normal in this condition, although the turbulence \nimparted by the subvalvular stenosis may affect leaflet mor -\nphology and valve competence.\nDiffuse subvalvular AS results in a long, tunnel-like obstruc -\ntion that may extend to the left ventricular apex. In some \nindividuals, there may be difficulty in distinguishing between \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diffuse subaortic stenosis.  \nOperation for subvalvular AS is indicated with a gradient \nexceeding 30 mm Hg, in the presence of aortic valve insuffi -\nciency, or when symptoms indicating left ventricular outflow \ntract (LVOT) obstruction are present. Given that repair of iso -\nlated discrete subaortic stenosis can be done with low rates of \nmorbidity and mortality, some surgeons advocate repair in all \ncases of discrete AS to avoid progression of the stenosis and the \ndevelopment of aortic insufficiency, although more recent data \ndemonstrate that subaortic resection should be delayed until the \nLV gradient exceeds 30 mm Hg because most children with an \ninitial LV gradient less than 30 mm Hg have quiescent disease. \nDiffuse AS is a more complex lesion and often requires aorto -\nventriculoplasty. Results are generally excellent, with operative \nmortality less than 5%. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 755\u2013758.)\nBrunicardi_Ch20_p157-170.indd   163 06/07/22   9:41 AM"

Resection with end-to-end anastomosis\nB. Resection with extended end-to-end anastomosis\nC. Endovascular stenting\nD. Dacron patch aortoplastyAnswer: D\nThe most common complications after coarctation of the \naorta (COA) repair are late restenosis (Fig. 20-4) and aneu -\nrysm formation at the repair site. Aneurysm formation is par -\nticularly common after patch aortoplasty when using Dacron \nmaterial.

A further complication, although uncommon, \nis lower-body paralysis resulting from ischemic spinal cord \ninjury during the repair. This dreaded outcome complicates \n0.5% of all surgical repairs, but its incidence can be lessened \nwith the use of some form of distal perfusion, preferably left \nheart bypass with the use of femoral arterial or distal thoracic \naorta for arterial inflow and the femoral vein or left atrium \nfor venous return. These techniques are generally reserved \nfor older patients with complex coarctations that may need \nprolonged aortic cross clamp times for repair, often in the \nsetting of large collateral vessels and/or previous surgery.  \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 762\u2013763.)produce equally effective results both in recurrent and in pri -\nmary COA, a finding with far-reaching implications in the \nnew paradigm of multidisciplinary treatment algorithms \nfor congenital heart defect (CHD).

In 1967, however, complete repair was accomplished \nby McGoon and his associates based on the experimental \nwork of Rastelli, who introduced the idea that an extracar -\ndiac valved conduit could be used to restore ventricular-to-  \npulmonary artery continuity. Over the next 20 years, improved \nsurvival rates led to uniform adoption of complete repair even \nin the youngest and smallest infants. Surgical correction entails \nthe use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

Mortality varies between 30% and 45%, \nand alternative catheter interventions do not offer definitive \nsolutions.

American College of Surgeons NSQUIP Risk Calcu -\nlator or the Revised Cardiac Risk Index can estimate \npatient specific risk.\nC. Risk assessment requires stress testing and \nechocardiography.\nD. Patients with recent percutaneous coronary interven -\ntion are at lower risk.Answer: B\nPatient characteristics can be classified by the status of the \npatient\u2019s cardiac disease, comorbid conditions, and functional \ncapacity. Patients are considered to be at major perioperative \nclinical risk if they have one or more of the following active \ncardiac conditions: acute coronary syndrome, decompen -\nsated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, or severe valvu -\nlar heart disease. In these patients, intensive evaluation and \ntreatment prior to surgery (unless emergent) are warranted, \nprior to proceeding with the noncardiac surgery.\nIf the patient does not have any of the previously men -\ntioned active cardiac conditions, the perioperative risk of \nMACE should be estimated. Both the operation performed \nand the patient\u2019s risk factors are predictive of MACE, and \nthe ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of either the \nAmerican College of Surgeons\u2019 NSQIP risk calculator or the \nRevised Cardiac Risk Index for the estimation of patient-  \nspecific risk.

The previous guidelines included inter -\nmediate and low cardiovascular risk profiles, but this has \nbeen replaced by cardiovascular risk factors in the update. \nThese risk factors are: history of ischemic heart disease, his -\ntory of prior or compensated heart failure, history of cere -\nbrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency. \nBased on the number of present risk factors and the surgery-\nspecific risk, the guidelines recommend pathways for further \nevaluation and risk management. The most recent guide -\nlines from ACC/AHA were published in 2014. One impor -\ntant subgroup of patients at elevated risk are those who have \nrecently undergone percutaneous coronary intervention. In \nthese patients, elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed \nuntil the risk of stent thrombosis decreases (30 days for bare \nmetal stents and 180 to 365 days for drug-eluting stents), \nand dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued unless \nthe risk of bleeding exceeds the risk of stent thrombosis.  \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 804.)\n 3.

End-organ dysfunction occurs because of hypoper -\nfusion, embolization, and whole body inflammatory \nresponse.Answer: B\nThe responses of the humoral and cellular immune systems \npartly overlap with the hemostatic pathways. The classic and \nalternative complement pathways are activated by CPB gen -\nerating powerful chemotaxic molecules and anaphylatoxins. \nMonocytes, platelets, and neutrophils are activated releasing \nacute inflammatory mediators and cytokines that persist even \nafter conclusion of CPB. These inflammatory cells also pro -\nduce reactive oxidants that may have cytotoxic and cardiovas -\ncular effects, such as vasodilation and hypotension.\nThe large quantity of unfractionated heparin used during \ncardiac surgery predisposes patients to developing HIT with \nan incidence of 1% to 5%. Platelet factor-4 (PF4) is produced \nby platelets and avidly binds to heparin to form a heparin-PF4 \ncomplex that can be antigenic in some patients binding IgG. \nThe IgG-heparin-PF4 complex can bind to platelets, which \ncauses release of more PF4, perpetuating the process.\n 5.

The conduit with the high -\nest patency rate (98% at 5 years and 85%\u201390% at 10 years) \nis the internal thoracic artery which is most commonly left \nattached proximally to the subclavian artery (although occa -\nsionally used as a free graft) and anastomosed distally to \nthe target coronary artery. The use of both internal thoracic \narteries has been shown to increase event-free survival in a \nnumber of studies. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 811.)TEE, on the other hand, is performed using a special endo -\nscope with an ultrasound probe mounted on its end that is \nintroduced orally into the esophagus under sedation. Pos -\nterior structures such as the mitral valve and left atrium are \nparticularly well visualized.

Cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction.\nD. Chronic congestive failure and ischemic cardiomy -\nopathy with no signs of angina.Answer: D\nPatients with ischemic cardiomyopathy are a heterogeneous \ngroup, and, as with any surgery, appropriate patient selection \nis central to success. In one retrospective study of 96 patients \nwith ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction [EF] \u2264 25%), \nage, and poor distal vessel quality were predictors of poor \noutcomes. Mortality in patients with poor vessel quality was \n100%, compared with 90% when vessel quality was fair and \n10% when it was good.

MS is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) with left \natrial thrombus and embolism.\nD. Pulmonary edema occurs due to left ventricular \nfailure.Answer: D\nAcquired MS is most often caused by rheumatic fever, with \napproximately 60% of patients with pure MS presenting with \na clinical history of rheumatic heart disease. Rarely, other \nconditions can cause obstruction to filling of the left ventricle \n(LV), mimicking MS. Acquired causes of mitral valve (MV) \nstenosis include left atrial myxoma, prosthetic valve throm -\nbosis, mucopolysaccharidosis, previous chest radiation, and \nsevere annular calcification.\nThe increased left atrial pressure is subsequently trans -\nmitted to the pulmonary venous system, causing pulmo -\nnary edema as the hydrostatic pressure in the vessels exceeds \nthe plasma oncotic pressure. Decreased pulmonary venous \ncompliance exacerbates the pulmonary venous hyperten -\nsion, though a concomitant decrease in microvascular per -\nmeability may preclude pulmonary edema in the chronic \nsetting. Patients may also develop pulmonary arterial hyper -\ntension, owing to vasoconstriction, intimal hyperplasia, and \nmedial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles in response \nto the increased pulmonary venous pressure. The second -\nary obstruction to flow caused by reactive pulmonary arte -\nrial hypertension may serve to protect against pulmonary \nedema, but it also exacerbates the intractable decrease in car -\ndiac output that develops as stenosis worsens. Throughout \nthe process, the left atrium becomes dilated and hypertro -\nphied due to increased work in filling the ventricle against a \nfixed obstruction. AF may develop, exacerbating the patient\u2019s \nsymptoms and increasing the risk of left atrial thrombus and \nsubsequent embolization. Left ventricular structure and func -\ntion are typically preserved owing to the protective effect of \nthe stenotic valve. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 818.) 7.

ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a shared process \nbetween patient and physician to determine the best \nchoice of valve prosthesis.\nD. Bioprosthetic valves have similar rates of thrombosis \ncompared to mechanical valves.Answer: C\nAlthough mechanical valves are highly durable, they require \npermanent anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of valve \nthrombosis and thromboembolic sequelae. Due to the con -\ncordant risk of hemorrhagic complications, patient charac -\nteristics such as debility, lifestyle, and contraindications to \nsystemic anticoagulation therapy may preclude mechanical \nvalve replacement. Moreover, young women who are plan -\nning future pregnancies cannot take warfarin due to its tera -\ntogenic potential. Conversely, patients with other indications \nfor systemic anticoagulation, such as other risk factors for \nthromboembolism (ie, atrial fibrillation), or the presence of \na mechanical prosthetic valve in place in another position, \nmay benefit from mechanical valve replacement. Current \nACC/AHA guidelines recommend a shared-decision-making \nprocess between patient and physician when determining the \nchoice of valve prosthesis, with the use of bioprosthetic valves \nin all patients who have a contraindication to lifelong anti -\ncoagulation or who are unwilling to receive it.

When \nmanaged appropriately, the yearly thromboembolic and \nbleeding risks in these patients are 1% to 2%, and 0.5% to 2%, \nrespectively. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 816.)\n 11. What valvular lesion is most commonly found in a \npatient with Marfan syndrome?\nA. Mitral stenosis\nB. Mitral insufficiency\nC. Aortic stenosis\nD. Aortic insufficiencyAnswer: D\nThe most common cause of isolated aortic insufficiency (AI) \nin patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) is aor -\ntic root disease and represents over 50% of such patients in \nsome studies. Other common causes of AI include congenital \nabnormalities of the aortic valve such as bicuspid aortic valve, \ncalcific degeneration, rheumatic disease, infective endocar -\nditis, systemic hypertension, myxomatous degeneration, dis -\nsection of the ascending aorta, and Marfan syndrome. Less \ncommon causes of AI include traumatic injuries to the aortic \nvalve, ankylosing spondylitis, syphilitic aortitis, rheumatoid \narthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, giant cell aortitis, Ehlers-\nDanlos syndrome, Reiter syndrome, discrete subaortic steno -\nsis, and ventricular septal defects with prolapse of an aortic \ncusp. Although most of these lesions produce chronic AI, \nrarely acute severe aortic regurgitation can result, often with \ndevastating consequences. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 825.)\n 12. Age-related calcific aortic stenosis (AS) causes some \ndegree of aortic insufficiency (AI) in approximately:\nA. 55%.\nB. 65%.\nC. 75%.\nD. 85%.Answer: C\nThere are also many primary valvular diseases that cause AI, \ngenerally in association with AS. One such disorder is age-\nrelated calcific AS, which causes some degree of AI in up to \n75% of patients. Infective endocarditis may involve the aortic \nvalve apparatus and cause AI through direct destruction of the \nvalve leaflets, perforation of a leaflet, or formation of vegeta -\ntions that interfere with proper coaptation of the valve cusps. \nRheumatic disease causes fibrous infiltration of the valve \ncusps and subsequent retraction of the valve leaflets, inhibit -\ning apposition of the cusps during diastole and producing a \ncentral regurgitant jet. Patients with large ventricular septal \ndefects or membranous subaortic stenosis may develop pro -\ngressive AI, owing to a Venturi effect that results in prolapse \nof the aortic valve leaflets.

It usually occurs 4\u20138 weeks after myocardial infarct.\nC. 1 year mortality is <5%.\nD. Generally, it requires >40% necrosis of the \nmyocardium.Answer: B\nA transmural infarction of approximately 5% to 10% of the \nmyocardium may result in formation of an LV aneurysm \nas necrotic myocardium is replaced by fibrous tissue. This \nusually occurs 4 to 8 weeks following the infarct. In the last \ndecade, prompt revascularization of the culprit artery by \neither surgical or interventional techniques generally results \nin sparing of the subepicardial muscle while the subendo -\ncardial muscle remains necrotic. Therefore, it is not uncom -\nmon for the LV wall to show both living myocardium during \nthallium testing and an akinetic zone on echocardiogram or \nangiogram. It has been demonstrated that once >20% of the \nmyocardium is necrosed, there is irreversible progression to \nventricular dilation and failure. Once heart failure develops \nafter postinfarction remodeling, the 1-year mortality reaches \n32% despite current therapies. The classic aneurysm is a 4 to \n6 mm thick scar, which bulges outward in paradoxical motion \nas the LV contracts during systole. More than 80% develop in \nthe anteroseptal and apical portions of the left ventricle as a \nresult of left anterior descending artery occlusion.

The most \nserious complication of AF is thromboembolism with resul -\ntant stroke, but serious morbidity and mortality may also \nresult from hemodynamic compromise due to loss of atrial \ncontraction, exacerbations of congestive heart failure from \natrioventricular asynchrony and tachycardia-induced cardio -\nmyopathy.

Tricuspid stenosis is almost always \na result of organic disease, namely rheumatic heart disease \nand endocarditis. In the case of rheumatic disease, tricuspid \nstenosis with or without associated insufficiency is invari -\nably associated with mitral valve disease.

Use of steroids or IV antibiotics.\nC. Surgical exploration and drainage.\nD. Observation.Answer: A\nThe preferred treatment depends on the underlying cause of \nthe pericarditis. The disease usually follows a self-limited and \nbenign course and can be successfully treated with a short \ncourse of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). \nSome patients may require judicious use of steroids or intra -\nvenous (IV) antibiotics. In cases of purulent pyogenic peri -\ncarditis, surgical exploration and drainage are occasionally \nnecessary. Rarely, accumulation of fluid in the pericardium \nmay lead to tamponade, requiring prompt evacuation of the \npericardial space. While pericardiocentesis will typically suf -\nfice, surgical drainage may be required for thick, viscous, \nor clotted fluid or in patients with significant scarring from \nprevious surgeries. More commonly, surgical intervention is \nrequired to manage recurrent disease. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 840.) 19. A patient presents with a history of fatigue and dyspnea. \nHe is found to have hepatomegaly, ascites, and an ele -\nvated jugular venous pulse. Heart sounds are normal, no \nmurmurs are present, and the heart is of normal size. The \npulse pressure is decreased by palpation. Electrocardiog -\nraphy is normal except for low voltage. The most likely \ndiagnosis is:\nA. Right atrial myxoma.\nB. Tricuspid valve disease.\nC. Constrictive pericarditis.\nD. Primary pulmonary artery hypertension.Answer: C\nClassic physical exam findings include jugular venous dis -\ntention with Kussmaul\u2019s sign, diminished cardiac apical \nimpulses, peripheral edema, ascites, pulsatile liver, a pericar -\ndial knock, and, in advanced disease, signs of liver dysfunc -\ntion, such as jaundice or cachexia. The \u201cpericardial knock\u201d is \nan early diastolic sound that reflects a sudden impediment \nto ventricular filling, similar to an S3 but of higher pitch. \nSeveral findings are characteristic on noninvasive and inva -\nsive testing. Central venous pressure (CVP) is often elevated \n15 to 20 mm Hg or higher. Electrocardiogram (ECG) com -\nmonly demonstrates nonspecific low voltage QRS complexes \nand isolated repolarization abnormalities. Chest X-ray may \ndemonstrate calcification of the pericardium, which is highly \nsuggestive of constrictive pericarditis in patients with heart \nfailure, but this is present in only 25% of cases. Cardiac CT \nor MRI (cMRI) typically demonstrate increased pericardial \nthickness (>4 mm) and calcification, dilation of the infe -\nrior vena cava, deformed ventricular contours, and flatten -\ning or leftward shift of the ventricular septum. Pericardial \nadhesions may also be seen on tagged cine MRI studies. As \ndiscussed, it is most important to distinguish pericardial con -\nstriction from restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is best done \nwith either echocardiography or right heart catheterization. \nFindings favoring constriction on echocardiography include \nrespiratory variation of ventricular septal motion and mitral \ninflow velocity, preserved or increased mitral annulus early \ndiastolic filling velocity, and increased hepatic vein flow \nreversal with expiration. Cardiac catheterization will show \nincreased atrial pressures, equalization of end-diastolic pres -\nsure, and early ventricular diastolic filling with a subsequent \nplateau, called the \u201csquare-root sign. \u201d Additional findings \nupon catheterization that would favor constriction include \nrespiratory variation in ventricular filling and increased ven -\ntricular interdependence, manifest as a discordant change in \nthe total area of the left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular \n(RV) systolic pressure curve with respiration.

Coronary blood flow increase.Answer: B\nIABP is the most commonly used device for mechanical cir -\nculatory support, and it may be easily deployed in the cathe -\nterization laboratory, in the operating room or at the bedside. \nThe device is inserted percutaneously through the femoral \nartery into the thoracic aorta.

About \n75% of the time, they arise from the interatrial septum near \nthe fossa ovalis in the left atrium. Most others will develop \nin the right atrium, but, less commonly, they can arise from \nvalvular surfaces and the walls of other cardiac chambers.  \nMacroscopically, these tumors are pedunculated with a gelat -\ninous consistency, and the surface may be smooth (65%), \nvillous, or friable. Size varies greatly with these tumors and \nranges from 1 to 15 cm in diameter.\nInternally, myxomas are heterogeneous and often contain \nhemorrhage, cysts, necrosis, or calcification. Histologically, \nthese tumors contain cells that arise from a multipotent mes -\nenchyme and are contained within a mucopolysaccharide \nstroma.

The phenotype of patients \nwith Marfan syndrome typically includes a tall stature, high \npalate, joint hypermobility, eye lens disorders, mitral valve \nprolapse, and aortic aneurysms.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections \nare less commonly associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, \nbut when they do occur, they pose a particularly challenging \nsurgical problem because of the reduced integrity of the aortic \ntissue. An Ehlers-Danlos variant of periventricular heteroto -\npia associated with joint and skin hyperextensibility and aor -\ntic dilation has been described as being caused by mutations \nin the gene encoding filamin A (FLNA), an actin-binding \nprotein that links the smooth muscle cell contractile unit to \nthe cell surface.

Critical hinge-point, the diameter where the risk of \nrupture increases dramatically, diameters are 6 cm \nfor ascending aorta and 7 cm for descending aorta.\nB. Fusiform aneurysm is more likely to rupture than \nsaccular aneurysm.\nC. Disease etiology rather than diameter is more rel -\nevant than diameter.\nD. Average expansion rates are about 1 cm per year \nfor both ascending and descending thoracic aorta \naneurysms.Answer: A\nAn analysis by Elefteriades of data from 1600 patients with \nthoracic aortic disease has helped quantify these well-  \nrecognized risks. Average expansion rates were 0.07 cm per \nyear in ascending aortic aneurysms and 0.19 cm per year in \ndescending thoracic aortic aneurysms. As expected, aortic \ndiameter was a strong predictor of rupture, dissection, and \nmortality. For thoracic aortic aneurysms > 6 cm in diame -\nter, annual rates of catastrophic complications were 3.6% for \nrupture, 3.7% for dissection, and 10.8% for death. Critical \n\u201chinge-point\u201d diameters, at which the incidence of expected \ncomplications significantly increased, were 6 cm for aneu -\nrysms of the ascending aorta and 7 cm for aneurysms of the \ndescending thoracic aorta; the corresponding risks of rupture \nafter reaching these diameters were 31% and 43%, respec -\ntively. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 857.)\n 9. The most common complication of extensive repair for \ndistal aortic aneurysms is:\nA. Spinal cord ischemia.\nB. Renal failure.\nC. Pulmonary dysfunction.\nD. Left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.Answer: C\nAlthough spinal cord ischemia and renal failure receive the \nmost attention, several other complications warrant consid -\neration. The most common complication of extensive repairs \nis pulmonary dysfunction. With aneurysms adjacent to the \nleft subclavian artery, the vagus and left recurrent laryngeal \nnerves are often adherent to the aortic wall and thus are sus -\nceptible to injury. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 871.)clot within a preexisting aneurysm. The most common caus -\native organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus \nepidermidis, Salmonella , and Streptococcus . Unlike most other \ncauses of thoracic aortic aneurysms, which generally produce \nfusiform aneurysms, infection often produces saccular aneu -\nrysms located in areas of aortic tissue destroyed by the infec -\ntious process.\nAlthough syphilis was once the most common cause of \nascending aortic aneurysms, the advent of effective antibiotic \ntherapy has made syphilitic aneurysms a rarity in developed \nnations. In other parts of the world, however, syphilitic aneu -\nrysms remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The \nspirochete Treponema pallidum  causes an obliterative end -\narteritis of the vasa vasorum that results in medial ischemia \nand loss of the elastic and muscular elements of the aortic \nwall. The ascending aorta and arch are the most commonly \ninvolved areas. Because syphilitic aortitis often presents \n10 to 30 years after the primary infection, the incidence of \nassociated aneurysms may increase in the near future. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 856.)\n 10. Which of the following is NOT TRUE regarding anasto -\nmotic pseudoaneurysms?\nA. These can arise from deterioration of aortic tissue \ndue to infection.\nB. These have increased in incidence with an influx of \ncardiovascular surgery.\nC. These commonly occur in patients with Marfan \nsyndrome.\nD. These are associated with high incidence of morbid -\nity and rupture.Answer: B\nAnastomotic pseudoaneurysms can be caused by technical \nproblems or by deterioration of the native aortic tissue, graft \nmaterial, or suture. Commonly, they occur in patients with \nMarfan syndrome. Tissue deterioration usually is related to \neither progressive degenerative disease or infection. Improve -\nments in sutures, graft materials, and surgical techniques \nhave decreased the incidence of thoracic aortic pseudoaneu -\nrysms. Should thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysms occur, they \ntypically require expeditious surgical or other intervention \nbecause they are associated with a high incidence of morbid -\nity and rupture.

Cardiac catheterization.\nC. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography \n[CT] and magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]).\nD. Abdominal ultrasound.Answer: C\nAlthough catheter-based contrast aortography was previously \nconsidered the gold standard for evaluating thoracic aortic \ndisease, cross-sectional imaging (ie, CT and MRA) has largely \nreplaced this modality. Technologic improvements have \nenabled CT and MRA to provide excellent aortic imaging \nwhile causing less morbidity than catheter-based studies do, \nso CT and MRA are now the primary modes for evaluating \nthoracic aortic disease. Today, the use of invasive aortography \nin patients with thoracic aortic disease is generally limited to \nthose undergoing endovascular therapies or when other types \nof studies are contraindicated or have not provided satisfac -\ntory results.

Its role in treat -\ning proximal aortic disease and thoracoabdominal aortic \naneurysm remains experimental; nonetheless, endoluminal \nstenting is approved by the US Food and Drug Administra -\ntion for the treatment of isolated descending thoracic aortic \naneurysm, and several different devices have been approved \nfor the treatment of blunt aortic injury and penetrating aortic \nulcer.

Requires aggressive pharmacologic treatment.\nC. Requires repair within 24 hours.\nD. Is not altered by signs of organ dysfunction.Answer: B\nRegardless of the location of the dissection, the initial treat -\nment is the same for all patients with suspected or confirmed \nacute aortic dissection (see Fig. 22-1). Furthermore, because \nof the potential for rupture before the diagnosis is confirmed, \naggressive pharmacologic management is started once there \nis clinical suspicion of dissection, and this treatment is con -\ntinued during the diagnostic evaluation. The goals of pharma -\ncologic treatment are to stabilize the dissection and prevent \nrupture. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 878.) 11. The most common presenting symptom in patients with \nan ascending thoracic aneurysm is:\nA. Anterior chest pain.\nB. Posterior chest pain.\nC. Aortic valve insufficiency.\nD. Sudden death.Answer: A\nInitially, aneurysmal expansion and impingement on adja -\ncent structures cause mild, chronic pain. The most common \nsymptom in patients with ascending aortic aneurysms is ante -\nrior chest discomfort; the pain is frequently precordial in loca -\ntion but may radiate to the neck and jaw, mimicking angina. \nAneurysms of the ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch \ncan cause symptoms related to compression of the superior \nvena cava, the pulmonary artery, the airway, or the sternum. \nRarely, these aneurysms erode into the superior vena cava or \nright atrium, causing acute high-output failure.

Mortality rates for operative repair of an aortic arch \naneurysm have been significantly reduced intraopera -\ntively by:\nA. Deep hypothermia to allow circulatory arrest.\nB. Innominate and left carotid artery cannulation to \npermit oxygenation of the brain.\nC. Right heart to left subclavian artery bypass to con -\ntinue brain perfusion.\nD. Use of an intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain dis -\ntal circulation.Answer: A\nLike the operations themselves, perfusion strategies used \nduring proximal aortic surgery depend on the extent of the \nrepair. Aneurysms that are isolated to the ascending seg -\nment can be replaced by using standard cardiopulmonary \nbypass and distal ascending aortic clamping. This provides \nconstant perfusion of the brain and other vital organs during \nthe repair. Aneurysms involving the transverse aortic arch, \nhowever, cannot be clamped during the repair, which neces -\nsitates the temporary withdrawal of cardiopulmonary bypass \nsupport; this is called circulatory arrest. To protect the brain \nand other vital organs during the circulatory arrest period, \nhypothermia must be initiated before pump flow is stopped. \nHowever, hypothermia is not without risk, and coagulopathy \nis associated with deep levels of hypothermia (<20\u00b0C), which \nhave been traditionally used in open arch repair. Recently, \nmore moderate levels of hypothermia (often between 22\u00b0C \nand 24\u00b0C) have been introduced that appear to decrease risks \nassociated with deep hypothermia while still providing suf -\nficient brain protection.

An endoleak occurs when \nthere is a persistent flow of blood (visible on radiologic imag -\ning) into the aneurysm sac, and it may occur during the \ninitial procedure or develop over time. Although endoleaks \nare a relatively common complication, they are not benign, \nbecause they lead to continual pressurization of the sac, \nwhich can cause expansion or even rupture. These compli -\ncations are categorized (Table 22-1) according to the site \nof the leak.

A CT scan obtained on day 2 or 3, compared with the \ninitial scan, is sufficient to rule out significant aortic \nexpansion.\nD. Inadequate blood pressure control has been found to \nbe associated with late aneurysm formation.Answer: C\nNonoperative, pharmacologic management of acute descend -\ning aortic dissection results in lower morbidity and mortality \nrates than traditional surgical treatment does. The most com -\nmon causes of death during nonoperative treatment are aor -\ntic rupture and end-organ malperfusion. Therefore, patients \nare continually reassessed for new complications. At least two \nserial CT scans\u2014usually obtained on day 2 or 3 and on day 8 \nor 9 of treatment\u2014are compared with the initial scan to rule \nout significant aortic expansion. Once the patient\u2019s condition \nhas been stabilized, pharmacologic management is gradu -\nally shifted from intravenous (IV) to oral medications. Oral \ntherapy, which usually includes a beta antagonist, is initi -\nated when systolic pressure is consistently between 100 and  \n110 mm Hg and the neurologic, renal, and cardiovascular \nsystems are stable.

Stents are manufactured from a variety of met -\nals including stainless steel, tantalum, cobalt basaloid, and \nNitinol.

Blooming artifact is the term used to describe artifact \nsecondary to thrombus formation in the aorta and \narteries.\nC. As a low dose of contrast is used, it is unlikely to be \nassociated with kidney complications.\nD. CTA has sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy that is \nequivalent to invasive angiography.Answer: D\nCTA is a noninvasive contrast-dependent method of imaging \narterial system. The contrast-filled vessels can be extracted \nfrom the slices and rendered in the three-dimensional format. \nCTA is increasingly being used to image the carotid bifurca -\ntion, and as computing power increases, the speed of image \nacquisition and the resolution will continue to increase. The \nmajor limitations of multidetector CTA are use of contrast \nand presence of artifacts caused by calcification and stents. \nCTA can overestimate the degree of in-stent stenosis, while \nheavy calcification can limit the diagnostic accuracy of the \nmethod by causing a \u201cblooming artifact. \u201d The artifact can \nbe overcome with alteration in image acquisition technique. \nThere are no randomized trials to document the superior -\nity of multidetector CTA of compared to traditional angiog -\nraphy, but there is emerging evidence to support the claim \nthat multidetector CTA has sensitivity, specificity, and accu -\nracy that rival invasive angiography.

Male aortas tend to be larger than female \naortas, and there is generalized growth of the aortic diameter \nwith each decade of life.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) reflecting focal \ndecreases in amplitude and slowing of the EEG waves \nare reflective of cerebral ischemia.\nC. A decrease to <80% of baseline velocity in the ipsi -\nlateral middle cerebral artery is a sign of cerebral \nischemia.\nD. Stump pressure measurement is the most sensitive \ntest for potential cerebral ischemia.Answer: B\nOf both, carotid endarterectomy is one of the earliest vascular \noperations ever described. This technique has been perfected \nin the last two decades, surgeons continue to debate many \naspects of this procedure. For instance, there is no universal \nagreement with regard to the best anesthetic of choice, the \nbest intraoperative cerebral monitoring, whether to routinely \nshunt, open versus eversion endarterectomy, and patch versus \nprimary closure. Depending on the anesthetic given, the sur -\ngeon must decide whether intraoperative cerebral monitoring \nis necessary or intra-arterial carotid shunting would be used. \nIn general, if the patient is awake, then his or her abilities to \nrespond to commands during carotid clamp determine the \nadequacy of cerebral perfusion to the ipsilateral hemisphere. \nOn the other hand, intraoperative EEG or transcranial power \nDoppler (TCD) has been used to monitor for adequate cere -\nbral perfusion during the clamp. For patients undergoing \nsurgery under general anesthesia, focal ipsilateral decreases \nin amplitude and slowing of EEG waves are indicative of cere -\nbral ischemia. Similarly, a decrease to <50% of baseline veloc -\nity in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery is a sign of cerebral \nischemia. For patients with poor collateral flow exhibiting \nsigns of cerebral ischemia, intra-arterial carotid shunting \nwith removal of the clamp will restore cerebral flow for the \nremaining part of the surgery. Stump pressures have been \nused to determine the need for intra-arterial carotid shunt -\ning. Some surgeons prefer to shunt all patients on a routine \nbasis and not use intraoperative cerebral monitoring.

Neck length more than 20 mm.\nB. Neck diameter >18 mm, and <32 mm.\nC. External iliac artery diameter >7 mm.\nD. Aortic neck angle < 60 degrees.Answer: A\nAnatomic eligibility for endovascular repair is mainly based \non three areas: The proximal aortic neck, common iliac arter -\nies, and external iliac and common femoral arteries, which \nrelate to the proximal and distal landing zones or fixation \nsite and the access vessels, respectively. The requirements \nfor proximal aortic neck are diameter of 18 to 28 mm and \nthe minimum length of 15 mm. Usually, multiple measure -\nments of the diameter are taken along the length of the neck \nto assess its shape. All diameter measurements are made from \nmid wall to mid wall of the vessel. Secondary considerations \ninclude the mural calcification < 50% circumference, luminal \nthrombus < 50% circumference, and angulation < 45 degrees. \nPresence of significant amount of any one of these secondary \nfeatures in combination with a relatively short proximal neck \nmay compromise successful short- and long-term fixation of \nthe stent graft and exclusion of the aneurysm. The treatable \ndiameters for common iliac arteries range from 8 to 20 mm, \nand there should be at least 20 mm of patent artery of uni -\nform diameter to allow adequate fixation. Finally, at least one \nof two common femoral and external iliac arteries must be at \nleast 7 mm in diameter in order to safely introduce the main \ndelivery sheath. Slightly smaller iliac diameters may be toler -\nated depending on the specific device and in the absence of \nsevere tortuosity and calcific disease. Difficult access is one of \nthe main causes of increased procedural time and intraopera -\ntive complications. Using these criteria, approximately 60% \nof all AAAs are anatomic candidates for endovascular repair. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 924\u2013925.)\n 10.

Duplex ultrasonography has accuracy of 50% for \ndetecting stenosis >70% in the superior mesenteric \nartery (SMA).\nD. Endovascular intervention is not indicated in patients \nwith asymptomatic occlusive disease of the mesen -\nteric arteries.Answer: B\nVascular occlusive disease of the mesenteric arteries is a rela -\ntively uncommon but potentially devastating condition that \ngenerally presents in patient over 60 years of age. It is a three \ntimes more frequent in women. There are three major mecha -\nnisms for visceral ischemia involving the mesenteric arteries:  \nAcute mesenteric ischemia, chronic mesenteric ischemia, \nand nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. The SMA is the most \ncommonly involved vessel in acute mesenteric ischemia. \nAcute thrombosis occurs in patients with underlying mes -\nenteric atherosclerosis, which typically involves the origin of \nthe mesenteric arteries while sparing the collateral branches. \nIn acute embolic mesenteric ischemia, the emboli typically \noriginate from the cardiac source. Nonocclusive mesenteric \nischemia is characterized by a low flow state and otherwise \nnormal mesenteric arteries and most frequently occurs in \ncritically ill patients on vasopressors. Duplex ultrasonogra -\nphy is a valuable noninvasive means of assessing the patency \nof mesenteric vessels. A peak systolic velocity in the SMA of \n>275 cm/s demonstrated a sensitivity of 92%, specificity of \n96%, and overall accuracy of 96% for detecting >70% stenosis.  \nSimilarly, duplex ultrasound had sensitivity and specific -\nity of 87% and 82%, respectively with an accuracy of 82% \nin predicting >70% stenosis in the celiac trunk. Endovascu -\nlar treatment of mesenteric artery stenosis or short segment aneurysms is atherosclerotic, clinically significant peripheral \nocclusive disease is unusual and present in <10% of all cases. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 920\u2013921.)\nBrunicardi_Ch23_p189-196.indd   192 08/07/22   11:41 AM"

Renal artery occlusive disease affects 5% to 10% of all \nhypertensive patients in the United States.\nB. The most common cause of renal artery occlusive \ndisease is atherosclerosis in 80% of patients followed \nby fibromuscular dysplasia.\nC. Renal artery revascularization is indicated in patients \nwith recurrent congestive heart failure or flash pul -\nmonary edema not attributable to active coronary \nischemia in the presence of >70% stenosis of the renal \nartery.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nObstructive lesions of the renal artery can produce hyperten -\nsion and it is reported in about 5% to 10% of all hyperten -\nsive patients in the United States. Approximately 80% of all \nrenal artery occlusive lesions are caused by atherosclerosis, \nwhich typically involves a short segment of the renal artery \nostia and represent spillover disease from a severely ath -\neromatous aorta. The second most common cause of renal \nartery stenosis is fibromuscular dysplasia, which accounts for \n20% of cases and is most frequently encountered in young, \noften multiparous women. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the \nrenal artery presents a heterogeneous group of lesions that \ncan produce histopathological changes in the intima, media \nor adventitia.

Type II aortoiliac disease represents diffuse aortoiliac \ndisease above the inguinal ligament.\nC. Type III represents multisegment occlusive disease \ninvolving the aortoiliac area and extending to the \nsupra renal aorta.\nD. Type I is more frequently found in men.Answer: B\nThe distal abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries are common \nsites affected by atherosclerosis. Based on the atherosclerotic \ndisease pattern, aortoiliac occlusive disease can be classified \ninto three types. Type I aortoiliac disease, which occurs in 5% \nto 10% of patient, is confined to the distal abdominal aorta \nand common iliac vessels. Due to the localized nature of this \ntype of aortic obstruction and formation of collateral blood \nflow around the occluded segment, limb-threatening symp -\ntoms are rare in the absence of more distal disease. This type of \naortoiliac occlusive disease occurs in a relatively young group occlusion by balloon dilatation or stent placement represent \na less invasive therapeutic alternative to open surgical inter -\nvention particularly in patients whose medical comorbidities \nplace them at a higher operative surgical risk. Endovascular \ntherapy is also suited in patients with recurrent disease or \nanastomotic stenosis following previous open mesenteric \nrevascularization. Prophylactic mesenteric revascularization \nis rarely performed in the asymptomatic patient undergo -\ning an aortic procedure for other indications. However, the \nnatural history of untreated chronic mesenteric ischemia may \njustify revascularization in some minimally symptomatic or \nasymptomatic patients if the operative risks are acceptable, \nsince the first clinical presentation may be acute intestinal \nischemia in as many as 50% of patients, with a mortality \nrate that ranges from 15% to 70%.

The obturator artery and nerve pass in the anterome -\ndial portion of the membrane.\nD. 5-year patency of 57% has been reported.Answer: D\nAn obturator bypass is used to reconstruct arterial anatomy \nin patients with a groin sepsis resulting from prior prostatic \ngrafting, intra-arterial drug abuse, growing neoplasm, or \ndamage from prior groin irradiation. This bypass can origi -\nnate from the common iliac artery, external iliac artery, or \nuninvolved limb of an aortobifemoral bypass. The conduit is \ntunneled through the anteromedial portion of the obturator \nmembrane to the distal superficial femoral artery or popliteal \nartery.

Histologically, fibrous \ntissue proliferation, smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, and elas -\ntic fiber destruction alternate with mural thinning. The char -\nacteristic beaded appearance of fibromuscular dysplasia is \ndue to areas of medial thinning alternating with areas of ste -\nnosis.

Bonding agents into the outer surface of the graft\nC. Bonding anticoagulants to the conduit to improve \npatency of the graft\nD. Applying rings to the graft to improve patencyAnswer: C\nIf a vein is unavailable, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or \nDacron can be used for above-knee bypass or in some cases \nbelow the knee. The addition of rings to the PTFE did not \nconfer benefit in a single prospective, randomized clinical \ntrial. For infrageniculate prosthetic bypasses, use of a vein \npatch, cuff, or other venous anastomotic modifications can \nimprove patency. Methods to improve prosthetic graft per -\nformance have consisted of altering the geometry at the dis -\ntal anastomosis to get the benefit obtained with vein cuffs \nand covalently binding agents onto the luminal surface with \nanticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative char -\nacteristics. A comparison of precuffed PTFE versus PTFE \nwith a vein cuff showed a 1 year and 2 years primary patency \nrates were 52% and 49% in the precuffed group and 62% and \n44% in the vein cuff group, respectively. Another approach \nfor improving outcomes using prosthetic for bypass grafts \ninvolves binding anticoagulants to the conduit. The Gore pro -\npaten graft has heparin-bonded into the luminal surface of \nthe PTFE graft using Carmeda bioactive surface technology. \nThe heparin-binding does not alter the micro structure and \nhandling characteristic of the PTFE. A prospective random -\nized trial suggested that heparin-bonded Dacron or PTFE \nwas superior to plain PTFE for above-knee popliteal bypass. \nThe 3-year primary patency rate for the heparin-bonded graft \nwas 55% compared with 42% for the PTFE.

Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the \nlower extremities is the best diagnostic modality.Answer: B\nThe adventitial cystic disease of the popliteal artery was first \ndescribed in 1954. It is a rare arterial condition occurring at \nan incidence of 0.1%, usually in the popliteal artery. This dis -\nease affects men in a ratio of approximately 5:1. The incidence \nis approximately 1 in 1200 cases of claudication or 1 and 1000 \nperipheral arteriograms. The disease may affect other vas -\ncular sites, such as the femoral, external iliac, radial, ulnar, \nand brachial arteries. The diagnosis should be considered in \nyoung patients with a mass in a nonaxial vessel in proximity \nto a related joint. The synovial-like mucin-filled cyst reside \nin the subadventitial layer of the vessel wall and have a simi -\nlar microscopical appearance to a ganglion cyst.

The superficial venous system lies \nabove the uppermost fascial layer of the leg and thigh and \nconsists of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and SSV and \ntheir tributaries. The GSV originates from the dorsal pedal \nvenous arch and courses cephalad and medially, anterior to \nthe medial malleolus, entering the common femoral vein \napproximately 4 cm inferior and lateral to the pubic tubercle. \nThe saphenous nerve accompanies the GSV medially from \nthe ankle to the level of the knee and supplies cutaneous sen -\nsation to the medial leg and ankle. The SSV originates later -\nally from the dorsal pedal venous arch and courses cephalad \nin the posterior calf. Most often, it penetrates the popliteal \nfossa, between the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocne -\nmius muscle, to join the popliteal vein. The termination of the \nSSV may be quite variable, however, with a proximal exten -\nsion of the SSV (the vein of Giacomini) connecting with the \ndeep femoral vein or GSV .

In the lower leg, paired veins parallel the course \nof the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, \nto join behind the knee forming the popliteal vein. Venous \nbridges connect the paired axial tibial veins in the lower leg. \nThe popliteal vein continues through the adductor hiatus to \nbecome the femoral vein. In the proximal thigh, the femoral \nvein joins with the deep femoral vein to form the common \nfemoral vein, becoming the external iliac vein at the inguinal \nligament.\nAs in the lower extremity, there are deep and superficial \nveins in the upper extremity.

The skin.\nD. Lymphatics.\nE. Venous capillaries.Answer: C\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may lead to characteristic \nchanges in the skin and subcutaneous tissues in the affected \nlimb. CVI results from incompetence of venous valves, venous \nobstruction, or both. Most CVI involves venous reflux, and \nsevere CVI often reflects a combination of reflux and venous \nobstruction. It is important to remember that although CVI \noriginates with abnormalities of the veins, the target organ \nof CVI is the skin , and the underlying physiologic and bio -\nchemical mechanisms leading to the cutaneous abnormali -\nties associated with CVI are poorly understood. A typical \nleg affected by CVI will be edematous, with edema increas -\ning over the course of the day. The leg may also be indurated \nand pigmented with eczema and dermatitis. These changes \nare associated with excessive proteinaceous capillary exudate \nand deposition of a pericapillary fibrin cuff that may limit \nnutritional exchange. In addition, an increase in white blood \ncell trapping within the skin microcirculation in CVI patients \nmay lead to microvascular congestion and thrombosis. Sub -\nsequently, white blood cells may migrate into the interstitium \nand release necrotizing lysosomal enzymes, potentially lead -\ning to tissue destruction and eventual ulceration.\nFibrosis can eventually develop from impaired nutrition, \nchronic inflammation, and fat necrosis ( lipodermatosclerosis). \nHemosiderin deposition due to the extravasation of red cells \nand subsequent lysis in the skin contributes to the charac -\nteristic pigmentation of chronic venous disease (Fig. 24-1). \nUlceration can develop with long-standing venous hyperten -\nsion and is associated with alterations in microcirculatory \nand cutaneous lymphatic anatomy and function. The most \ncommon location of venous ulceration is approximately 3 cm \nproximal to the medial malleolus (Fig. 24-2).

The cephalic vein originates at the lat -\neral wrist and courses over the lateral ventral surface of the \nforearm. In the upper arm, the cephalic vein terminates in \nthe infraclavicular fossa, piercing the clavipectoral fascia to \nempty into the axillary vein. The basilic vein runs medially \nalong the forearm and penetrates the deep fascia as it courses \npast the elbow in the upper arm. It then joins with the deep \nbrachial veins to become the axillary vein, a landmark for \nidentification of the axillary vein. The median antecubital \nvein joins the cephalic and the basilic veins on the ventral \nsurface of the elbow.\nThe axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein at the lateral \nborder of the first rib. At the medial border of the scalenus \nanterior muscle, the subclavian vein joins with the inter -\nnal jugular vein to become the brachiocephalic vein, with \nthe subclavian vein coursing anterior to the scalenus ante -\nrior muscle. The left and right brachiocephalic veins join to \nbecome the superior vena cava, which empties into the right \natrium.

Endothelial Damage\nC. Hypercoagulability\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: C\nThree conditions, first described by Rudolf Virchow in 1862, \ncontribute to venous thromboembolism (VTE) formation: \nstasis of blood flow, endothelial damage, and hypercoagu -\nlability. Of these risk factors, relative hypercoagulability \nappears most important in most cases of spontaneous  VTE , \nor  so-called idiopathic VTE, whereas stasis and endothe -\nlial damage likely play a greater role in secondary  VTE, or \n so-called provoked VTE, occurring in association with \n transient risk factors such as immobilization, surgical proce -\ndures, and trauma. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 984.)\n 5. All of the following are acquired risk factors for venous \nthromboembolism (VTE) EXCEPT:\nA. Nephrotic syndrome.\nB. Factor V Leiden.\nC. Malignancy.\nD. Pregnancy.\nE. Obesity.\nF. Varicose veins.Answer: B\nThe more common acquired VTE risk factors include older \nage (>40 years), hospitalization and immobilization, hor -\nmone replacement and oral contraceptive therapy, pregnancy \nand the recently postpartum state, prior VTE, malignancy, \nmajor surgery, obesity, nephrotic syndrome, trauma and spi -\nnal cord injury, long-haul travel (>6 hours), varicose veins, \nantiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, \nand polycythemia. Heritable risk factors include male sex, \nfactor V Leiden mutation; prothrombin 20210A gene variant; \nantithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies; and dys -\nfibrinogenemias. In some patients, the cause of the thrombo -\nphilia may have both a heritable and an acquired component. \nThese mixed causes include homocysteinemia; factors VII, \nVIII, IX, and XI elevation; hyperfibrinogenemia; and acti -\nvated protein C resistance in the absence of factor V Leiden.\nThere may be a synergistic effect when particular multiple \ninherited and acquired risk factors are present in the same \npatient.\nOther patient-specific factors associated with venous \nthrombosis include the traditional cardiovascular risk fac -\ntors of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. VTE is more \ncommon in whites and African Americans than Asians and \nNative Americans. Certain gene variants (single nucleotide \npolymorphisms) are also associated with a mildly increased \nrisk for VTE, and their presence may interact with other risk \n factors to increase the overall risk for venous thrombosis. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., Figure 24-3, p. 984.) 3. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with all \nof the following EXCEPT:\nA. Increased morbidity and mortality.\nB. Pulmonary hypertension.\nC. Postthrombotic syndrome.\nD. No change in future risk of VTE.Answer: D\nThe incidence of VTE is approximately 100 per 100,000 peo -\nple per year in the general population, with 20% of the diag -\nnoses made within 3 months of a surgical procedure. Of the \nsymptomatic patients, one-third will present with pulmonary \nembolism (PE) and two-thirds with deep vein thrombosis \n(DVT). The estimated number of cases of VTE may well be \nover 600,000 per year in the United States, making it a major \nUS health problem. Furthermore, death occurs in 6% of DVT \nand 12% of PE cases within 1 month of diagnosis. Not only \ndoes VTE pose a veritable threat to life, but it also places \npatients at higher risk for recurrence and post-VTE sequelae  \nsuch as pulmonary hypertension and postthrombotic \n syndrome, with 4% and up to 30% incidence, respectively. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 984.)\nBrunicardi_Ch24_p197-206.indd   200 08/07/22   11:47 AM"

Placement of an IVC filter allows for a reduced dura -\ntion of anticoagulation therapy.\nB. In patients with a proximal DVT, placement of an \nIVC filter reduces rate of pulmonary embolism, and \nalso prolongs early and late survival.\nC. The rate of fatal complications related to IVC filters is \n<0.12%.\nD. An IVC filter is safe to leave in place after it is no \nlonger needed.\nE. All of above.Answer: C\nWhen possible, anticoagulation therapy should be continued \nin patients with vena cava filters. The duration of anticoagu -\nlation is determined by the underlying venous thromboem -\nbolism (VTE) and not by the presence of the IVC filter itself. \nPractically speaking, however, many patients who require an \nIVC filter for recurrent VTE are the same ones who would \nbenefit most from indefinite anticoagulation. In patients who \nare not able to receive anticoagulants due to recent surgery or \ntrauma, the clinician should continually reassess if anticoagu -\nlation may be started safely at a later date.\nPlacement of permanent IVC filters has been evaluated as \nan adjunct to routine anticoagulation in patients with proxi -\nmal DVT. Routine IVC filter placement has not been shown to \nprolong early or late survival in patients with proximal DVT \nbut did decrease the rate of PE (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05\u20130.90); \nhowever, there is an increased rate of recurrent DVT in \npatients with IVC filters (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.10\u20133.20).\nIVC filters are associated with acute and late complications. \nAcute complications include thrombosis or bleeding at the \ninsertion site and misplacement of the filter. Late complications \ninclude thrombosis of the IVC, DVT, breaking, migration, or \nerosion of the filter through the IVC (Fig. 24-4). The rate of fatal \ncomplications is <0.12%. As a result of the increasing number of \nreported complications with IVC filters, the US Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) issued a warning in 2010 recommend -\ning removal of IVC filters as soon as they are no longer needed. \nThis was followed by an update in 2014 where the recommen -\ndation was made to remove IVC filters within 29 and 54 days \nafter implantation based upon a mathematical model that sug -\ngested an increased risk-to-benefit ratio at this time point.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.\nB. Antibiotics.\nC. Systemic steroid therapy.\nD. Removal of existing indwelling venous catheters.Answer: C\nTreatment of SVT is quite variable. A Cochrane Review \nreported that low molecular weight heparin (LMWHs) and \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs both reduce the rate of \nSVT extension or recurrence. Topical medications appear to \nimprove local symptoms. Surgical treatment, combined with \nthe use of graduated compression stockings, is associated with \na lower rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and SVT \nprogression. The treatment is individualized and depends on \nthe location of the thrombus and the severity of symptoms. In \npatients with SVT not within 1 cm of the saphenofemoral junc -\ntion, treatment consists of compression and administration \nof an anti-inflammatory medication such as indomethacin.  \nIn patients with suppurative SVT, antibiotics and removal of \nany existing indwelling catheters are mandatory. Excision of \nthe vein may be necessary but is usually reserved for patients \nwith systemic symptoms or when excision of the involved vein \nis straightforward. If the SVT extends proximally to within  \n1 cm of the saphenofemoral junction, extension into the com -\nmon femoral vein is more likely to occur.

Elevation is an important aspect \nof controlling lower extremity swelling and is often the first \nrecommended intervention. However, continuous elevation \nthroughout the day can interfere with quality of life more \nthan lymphedema itself. Elevation is an adjunct to lymph -\nedema therapy but is not the mainstay of treatment.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression therapy . The use of \nIPC with a single-chamber or multichamber pump temporar -\nily reduces edema and provides another adjunct to the use of \ncompression stockings. These devices have been shown to be \neffective in reducing limb volume; however, use of compres -\nsion stockings is necessary to maintain the volume reduction \nwhen the patient is no longer supine because fluid transport \nis not associated with the transport of macromolecules (pro -\nteins) from the tissue.

Inferior cervical artery.\nE. Facial artery.Answer: B\nThe cervical portion of the esophagus receives its main blood \nsupply from the inferior thyroid artery. The thoracic por -\ntion receives its blood supply from the bronchial arteries, \nwith 75% of individuals having one right-sided and two left-\nsided branches. Two esophageal branches arise directly from \nthe aorta. The abdominal portion of the esophagus receives \nits blood supply from the ascending branch of the left gas -\ntric artery and from inferior phrenic arteries (Fig. 25-1). \nOn entering the wall of the esophagus, the arteries assume a \nT-shaped division to form a longitudinal plexus, giving rise to \nan intramural vascular network in the muscular and submu -\ncosal layers. As a consequence, the esophagus can be mobi -\nlized from the stomach to the level of the aortic arch without \nfear of devascularization and ischemic necrosis. Caution \nshould be exercised as to the extent of esophageal mobiliza -\ntion in patients who have had a previous thyroidectomy with \nligation of the inferior thyroid arteries proximal to the origin \nof the esophageal branches.

Cricopharyngeal muscle.Answer: C\nThree normal areas of esophageal narrowing are evident on \nthe barium esophagogram or during esophagoscopy. The \nuppermost narrowing is located at the entrance into the \nesophagus and is caused by the cricopharyngeal muscle. Its \nluminal diameter is 1.5 cm, and it is the narrowest point of the \nesophagus. The middle narrowing is due to an indentation \nof the anterior and left lateral esophageal wall caused by the \ncrossing of the left main stem bronchus and aortic arch. The \nluminal diameter at this point is 1.6 cm. The lowermost nar -\nrowing is at the hiatus of the diaphragm and is caused by the \ngastroesophageal sphincter mechanism. The luminal diam -\neter at this point varies somewhat, depending on the disten -\ntion of the esophagus by the passage of food, but has been \nmeasured at 1.6 to 1.9 cm. These normal constrictions tend to \nhold up swallowed foreign objects, and the overlying mucosa \nis subject to injury by swallowed corrosive liquids due to their \nslow passage through these areas.

Alpha-adrenergic neu -\nrotransmitters or beta blockers stimulate the LES, and alpha \nblockers and beta stimulants decrease its pressure. It is not \nclear to what extent cholinergic nerve activity controls LES \npressure. The vagus nerve carries both excitatory and inhibi -\ntory fibers to the esophagus and sphincter. The hormones \ngastrin and motilin have been shown to increase LES pres -\nsure; and cholecystokinin, estrogen, glucagon, progesterone, \nsomatostatin, and secretin decrease LES pressure.

Endoscopically, BE can be quiescent or associated with \ncomplications of esophagitis, stricture, Barrett ulceration, \nand dysplasia. The complications associated with BE may be \ndue to the continuous irritation from refluxed duodenogas -\ntric juice. This continued injury is pH-dependent and may \nbe modified by medical therapy. The incidence of metaplas -\ntic Barrett epithelium becoming dysplastic and progressing \nto adenocarcinoma is approximately 0.2% to 0.5% per year. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1035.)\n 5. The histologic hallmark of Barrett esophagus (BE) is:\nA. Columnar epithelium.\nB. Goblet cells.\nC. Parietal cells.\nD. Cuboidal epithelium.Answer: B\nThe definition of BE has evolved considerably over the past \ndecade. Traditionally, BE was identified by the presence of \ncolumnar mucosa extending at least 3 cm into the esopha -\ngus. It is now recognized that the specialized, intestinal-type \nepithelium found in the Barrett mucosa is the only tissue \npredisposed to malignant degeneration. Consequently, the \ndiagnosis of BE is presently made given any length of endo -\nscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves, on \nbiopsy, to show intestinal metaplasia (IM). Although long \nsegments of columnar mucosa without IM do occur, they are \nuncommon and might be congenital in origin.\nThe hallmark of IM is the presence of intestinal goblet \ncells. There is a high prevalence of biopsy-demonstrated IM \nat the cardia, on the gastric side of the squamocolumnar junc -\ntion, in the absence of endoscopic evidence of a columnar-\nlined esophagus (CLE). Evidence is accumulating that these \npatches of what appears to be Barrett in the cardia have a \nsimilar malignant potential as in the longer segments, and \nare precursors for carcinoma of the cardia. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1035.)\n 6. Squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus most com -\nmonly occur:\nA. At the gastroesophageal junction.\nB. In the cervical and upper thoracic esophagus.\nC. In the lower thoracic esophagus.\nD. Evenly distributed throughout the esophagus.Answer: B\nIt is estimated that 8% of the primary malignant tumors of \nthe esophagus occur in the cervical portion. They are almost \nalways squamous cell cancer, with a rare adenocarcinoma \narising from a congenital inlet patch of columnar lining. \nThese tumors, particularly those in the postcricoid area, rep -\nresent a separate pathologic entity for two reasons: (a) They \nare more common in females and appear to be a unique entity \nin this regard; and (b) The efferent lymphatics from the cervi -\ncal esophagus drain completely differently from those of the \nthoracic esophagus. The latter drain directly into the para -\ntracheal and deep cervical or internal jugular lymph nodes \n(LNs) with minimal flow in a longitudinal direction. Except \nin advanced disease, it is unusual for intrathoracic LNs to be \ninvolved. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1685.)\n 7. The preoperative test most heavily correlated with the \nability to tolerate an esophagectomy is:\nA. DLCO.\nB. FEV1.\nC. Ability to climb 1 flight of stairs.\nD. FVC.Answer: B\nPatients undergoing esophageal resection should have suf -\nficient cardiopulmonary reserve to tolerate the proposed \nprocedure. The respiratory function is best assessed with the \nforced expiratory volume in 1 second, which ideally should \nbe 2 L or more. Any patient with a forced expiratory volume \nin 1 second of <1.25 L is a poor candidate for thoracotomy, \nbecause he or she has a 40% risk of dying from respiratory \ninsufficiency within 4 years. In patients with poor pulmonary \nreserve, the transhiatal esophagectomy should be considered, \nBrunicardi_Ch25_p207-222.indd   209 04/07/22   2:39 PM"

Patients with dysphagia secondary to esophageal cancer \ntreated with radiation can expect the benefit to last:\nA. <1 month.\nB. 2\u20133 months.\nC. 6\u201312 months.\nD. >12 months.Answer: B\nPrimary treatment with radiation therapy does not produce \nresults comparable with those obtained with surgery. Cur -\nrently, the use of radiotherapy is restricted to patients who are \nnot candidates for surgery, and is usually combined with che -\nmotherapy. Radiation alone is used for palliation of dysphagia \nbut the benefit is short-lived, lasting only 2 to 3 months. Fur -\nthermore, the length and course of treatment are difficult to \njustify in patients with a limited life expectancy. Radiation is \neffective in patients who have hemorrhage from the primary \ntumor. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1074.)as the pulmonary morbidity of this operation is less than is \nseen following thoracotomy. Clinical evaluation and electro -\ncardiogram are not sufficient indicators of cardiac reserve. \nEchocardiography and dipyridamole thallium imaging pro -\nvide accurate information on wall motion, ejection fraction, \nand myocardial blood flow. A defect on thallium imaging \nmay require further evaluation with preoperative coronary \nangiography. A resting ejection fraction of <40%, particularly \nif there is no increase with exercise, is an ominous sign. In \nthe absence of invasive testing, observed stair-climbing is an \neconomical (albeit not quantitative) method of assessing car -\ndiopulmonary reserve. Most individuals who can climb three \nflights of stairs without stopping will do well with two-field \nopen esophagectomy, especially if an epidural catheter is used \nfor postoperative pain relief. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1073.)\n 8. Which of the following tests most accurately assesses the \nT stage of esophageal cancer?\nA. High-resolution CT scan\nB. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nC. Echocardiography\nD. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)\nE. EsophagogastroduodenoscopyAnswer: D\nFor years, clinical staging, contrast radiography, endoscopy, \nand computed tomography (CT) scanning formed the back -\nbone of esophageal cancer staging. More recently, preoperative \ndecision-making is guided by endoscopic ultrasonography \nand positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.\nEUS provides the most reliable method of determining \ndepth of cancer invasion. In the absence of enlarged lymph \nnodes (LNs), the degree of wall invasion dictates surgical \ntherapy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1073.)\n 9. Which of the following patients would not be considered \na candidate for esophagectomy?\nA. A 55-year-old man with gastroesophageal junction \n(GEJ) adenocarcinoma confined to the muscularis \nmucosa\nB. A 47-year-old woman with mid-esophageal cancer \nand an involved cervical lymph node (LN)\nC. A 60-year-old man with a large GEJ carcinoma with \ninvasion into the pleura without a malignant effusion\nD. A 70-year-old woman with a small GEJ cancer and \nthree pathologic LNs nearby on EUSAnswer: B\nIf the tumor invades in to the submucosa, without visible \nLN involvement, most individuals would suggest esophagec -\ntomy with LN dissection, as positive nodes can be found in \n20% to 25% of those with cancer limited to the mucosa and \nsubmucosa. If EUS demonstrates spread through the wall of \nthe esophagus, especially if LNs are enlarged, then induc -\ntion chemoradiation therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) should \nbe strongly considered. Lastly, when the EUS demonstrates \n invasion of the trachea, bronchus, aorta, or spine, then  surgical \nresection is rarely indicated. If there is invasion into the pleura \n(T4a), then surgical resection can be considered in the absence \nof a malignant effusion. Thus, it can be seen that the therapy \nof esophageal cancer is largely driven by the  findings of an \nendoscopic ultrasonography. It is difficult to provide modern \ntreatment of esophageal cancer without access to this modal -\nity.

The most common location for the injury is the left lat -\neral wall of the esophagus, just above the GEJ. To get adequate \nexposure of the injury, a dissection similar to that described \nfor esophageal myotomy is performed. A flap of stomach is \npulled up and the soiled fat pad at the GEJ is removed. The \nedges of the injury are trimmed and closed primarily. The \nclosure is reinforced with the use of a pleural patch or con -\nstruction of a Nissen fundoplication.

Observation.\nB. Esophagectomy.\nC. Enucleation.\nD. Endoscopic resection.Answer: C\nDespite their slow growth and limited potential for malignant \ndegeneration, leiomyomas should be removed unless there \nare specific contraindications. The majority can be removed \nby simple enucleation. If, during removal, the mucosa is \ninadvertently entered, the defect can be repaired primarily. \nAfter tumor removal, the outer esophageal wall should be \nreconstructed by closure of the muscle layer. The location \nof the lesion and the extent of surgery required will dictate \nthe approach. Lesions of the proximal and middle esopha -\ngus require a right thoracotomy, whereas distal esophageal \nlesions require a left thoracotomy. Videothoracoscopic and \nlaparoscopic approaches are now frequently used. The mor -\ntality rate associated with enucleation is low, and success in \nrelieving the dysphagia is near 100%. Large lesions or those \ninvolving the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) may require \nesophageal resection. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1081.)\n 13.

Treatment \nshould consist of:\nA. Esophagectomy.\nB. Observation.\nC. Proximal gastrectomy with esophago-jejunostomy.\nD. Injection of botulinum toxin.Answer: B\nMallory-Weiss tears are characterized by arterial bleeding, \nwhich may be massive. Vomiting is not an obligatory factor, \nas there may be other causes of an acute increase in intra-\nabdominal pressure, such as paroxysmal coughing, seizures, \nand retching. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspi -\ncion, particularly in the patient who develops upper gastro -\nintestinal (GI) bleeding following prolonged vomiting or \nretching. Upper endoscopy confirms the suspicion by identi -\nfying one or more longitudinal fissures in the mucosa of the \nherniated stomach as the source of bleeding.\nIn the majority of patients, the bleeding will stop spon -\ntaneously with nonoperative management. In addition to \nblood replacement, the stomach should be decompressed and \nantiemetics administered, as a distended stomach and con -\ntinued vomiting aggravate further bleeding. A Sengstaken-\nBlakemore tube will not stop the bleeding, as the pressure \nin the balloon is not sufficient to overcome arterial pressure. \nEndoscopic injection of epinephrine may be therapeutic if \nbleeding does not stop spontaneously. Only occasionally will \nsurgery be required to stop blood loss. The procedure consists \nof laparotomy and high gastrotomy with oversewing of the \nlinear tear.

Innervation of stylopharyngeus muscle.Answer: E\nThe parasympathetic innervation of the pharynx and esopha -\ngus is provided mainly by the vagus nerves. The constrictor \nmuscles of the pharynx receive branches from the pharyngeal \nplexus, which is on the posterior lateral surface of the middle \nconstrictor muscle, and is formed by pharyngeal branches of \nthe vagus nerves with a small contribution from cranial nerves \nIX and XI (Fig. 25-2).

Which of the following disorders involves simultaneous \nnonperistaltic contractions of the esophagus?\nA. Achalasia\nB. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES)\nC. Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter\nD. Nutcracker esophagusAnswer: B\nThe classic manometric findings in these patients are char -\nacterized by the frequent occurrence of simultaneous wave -\nforms and multipeaked esophageal contractions, which may \nbe of abnormally high amplitude or long duration. Key to the \ndiagnosis of DES is that there remain some peristaltic wave -\nforms in excess of those seen in achalasia. A criterion of \u226530% \nperistaltic waveforms out of 10 wet swallows has been used \nto differentiate DES from vigorous achalasia. However, this \nfigure is arbitrary and often debated.\nThe lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in patients with DES \nusually shows a normal resting pressure and relaxation on \nswallowing. A hypertensive sphincter with poor relaxation \nmay also be present. In patients with advanced disease, the \nradiographic appearance of tertiary contractions appears \nhelical, and has been termed corkscrew esophagus or pseudo -\ndiverticulosis.

Into regional nodes.\nC. In a transverse direction.\nD. Directly into the muscle layer.\nE. In a hematogenous fashion.Answer: A\nThe lymphatics located in the submucosa of the esophagus are \nso dense and interconnected that they constitute a single plexus \n(Fig. 25-3). There are more lymph vessels than blood capillar -\nies in the submucosa. Lymph flow in the submucosal plexus \nruns in a longitudinal direction, and, on injection of a contrast \nmedium, the longitudinal spread is seen to be about six times \nthat of the transverse spread. In the upper two-thirds of the \nesophagus, the lymphatic flow is mostly cephalad, and, in the \nlower third, caudad. In the thoracic portion of the esophagus, \nthe submucosal lymph plexus extends over a long distance in \na longitudinal direction before penetrating the muscle layer to \nenter lymph vessels in the adventitia. As a consequence of this \nnonsegmental lymph drainage, a primary tumor can extend \nfor a considerable length superiorly or inferiorly in the sub -\nmucosal plexus. Consequently, free tumor cells can follow the \nsubmucosal lymphatic plexus in either direction for a long \ndistance before they pass through the muscularis and into the \nregional lymph nodes (LNs). The cervical esophagus has more \ndirect segmental lymph drainage into the regional nodes, and, \nas a result, lesions in this portion of the esophagus have less \nsubmucosal extension and a more regionalized lymphatic \nspread.

Damage to these nerves interferes not only \nwith the function of the vocal cords but also with the func -\ntion of the cricopharyngeal sphincter and the motility of the \ncervical esophagus, predisposing the individual to pulmonary \naspiration on swallowing.

This may be an explanation for \nthe observation of spontaneous lower esophageal relaxation, \nthought by some to be a causative factor in gastroesophageal \nreflux disease (GERD). The power of the worm-drive pump \nof the esophageal body is insufficient to force open a valve that \ndoes not relax. In dogs, a bilateral cervical parasympathetic \nblockade abolishes the relaxation of the LES that occurs with \npharyngeal swallowing or distention of the esophagus. Conse -\nquently, vagal function appears to be important in coordinat -\ning the relaxation of the LES with esophageal contraction.\nThe antireflux mechanism in human beings is composed \nof three components: A mechanically effective LES, efficient \nesophageal clearance, and an adequately functioning gastric \nreservoir. A defect of any one of these three components can \nlead to increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and \nthe development of mucosal injury.

The lat -\nter consists of an antimony pH electrode fitted inside a small,  \ncapsule-shaped device accompanied by a battery and elec -\ntronics that allow 48-hour monitoring and transmission of \nthe pH data via transcutaneous radio telemetry to a waist-\nmounted data logger. The device can be introduced either \ntransorally or transnasally, and it can be clipped to the \nesophageal mucosa using endoscopic fastening techniques.

PPI->24-hour pH study->endoscopy->surgery\nD. 24-hour pH study->endoscopy->PPI->surgeryAnswer: A\nTraditionally, a stepwise approach is used for the treatment \nof GERD. First-line therapy entails antisecretory medication, \nusually proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), in most patients. Fail -\nure of medication to adequately control GERD symptoms sug -\ngests either that the patient may have relatively severe disease \nor a non-GERD cause for his or her symptoms. Endoscopic \nexamination at this stage of the patient\u2019s evaluation is recom -\nmended and will provide the opportunity to assess the degree \nof mucosal injury and presence of Barrett esophagus (BE). \nTreatment options for these patients entail either long-term \nPPI use versus antireflux surgery. Laparoscopic antireflux \nsurgery in these patients achieves long-term control of symp -\ntoms in 85% to 90%. The measurement of esophageal acid \nexposure via 24-hour pH should be undertaken when patients \nare considered for surgery. The status of the lower esophageal \nsphincter (LES) and esophageal body function with esopha -\ngeal manometry should also be performed at this stage. These \nstudies will serve to establish the diagnosis and assess esopha -\ngeal body dysfunction. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1037 .)\n 21.

Reconstruct the valve to a length <3 cm.\nD. Create a loose wrap.\nE. Maintain the position of the gastric fundus close to \nthe distal esophagus.Answer: C\nThe primary goal of antireflux surgery is to safely create a \nnew antireflux valve at the gastroesophageal junction, while \npreserving the patient\u2019s ability to swallow normally and to \nbelch to relieve gaseous distention. Regardless of the choice \nof the procedure, this goal can be achieved if attention is \npaid to some basic principles when reconstructing the anti -\nreflux mechanism. First, the operation should create a flap \nvalve which prevents regurgitation of gastric contents into \nthe esophagus. This will result in an increase in the pressure \nof the distal esophageal sphincter region. Following a Nissen \nfundoplication the expected increase is to a level twice the \nresting gastric pressure (ie, 12 mm Hg for a gastric pressure mp mppH\n8\n6\n4\n2\nmppH\n8\n6\n4\n2\npH\n8\n6\n4\n2sp\n06:00 00:00 22:00 02:00 04:0022:00 16:00 14:00 18:00 20:00\n14:00 08:00 06:00 10:00 12:00FIG. 25-5.

The extent of the pressure rise is often less fol -\nlowing a partial fundoplication, although with all types of \nfundoplication the length of the reconstructed valve should \nbe at least 3 cm. This not only augments sphincter charac -\nteristics in patients in whom they are reduced before surgery \nbut also prevents unfolding of a normal sphincter in response \nto gastric distention (Fig. 25-6). Preoperative and postop -\nerative esophageal manometry measurements have shown \nthat the resting sphincter pressure and the overall sphincter \nlength can be surgically augmented over preoperative values, \nand that the change in the former is a function of the degree \nof gastric wrap around the esophagus (Fig. 25-7). However, \nthe aim of any fundoplication is to create a loose wrap and to \nmaintain the position of the gastric fundus close to the distal \nintra-abdominal esophagus, in a flap valve arrangement.

Upward dislocation of the cardia in the posterior \nmediastinumAnswer: C\nWith the advent of clinical radiology, it became evident that \na diaphragmatic hernia was a relatively common abnormality \nand was not always accompanied by symptoms. Three types of \nesophageal hiatal hernia were identified: (a) the sliding hernia, \ntype I, characterized by an upward dislocation of the cardia in \nthe posterior mediastinum (Fig. 25-8A); (b) the rolling or PEH, \ntype II, characterized by an upward dislocation of the gastric \nfundus alongside a normally positioned cardia (Fig. 25-8B); \nand (c) the combined sliding-rolling or mixed hernia, type III, \ncharacterized by an upward dislocation of both the cardia and \nthe gastric fundus (Fig. 25-8C). The end stage of type I and \ntype II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up \ninto the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, \nwith the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation, \nthe abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stom -\nach (Fig. 25-8D). In some taxonomies, a type IV hiatal hernia \nis declared when an additional organ, usually the colon, herni -\nates as well. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1046\u20131047 .)\nB A\nFIG. 25-8.  A.

Antireflux surgery.\nB. Excision of the ring.\nC. Dilation.\nD. Ablation.\nE. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI).Answer: C\nSymptoms in patients with a ring are caused more by the \npresence of the ring than by gastroesophageal reflux. Most \npatients with a ring but without proven reflux respond to \none dilation, while most patients with proven reflux require \nrepeated dilations. In this regard, the majority of Schatzki \nring patients without proven reflux have a history of ingestion \nof drugs known to be damaging to the esophageal mucosa. \nBonavina and associates have suggested drug-induced injury \nas the cause of stenosis in patients with a ring, but without \na history of reflux. Because rings also occur in patients with \nproven reflux, it is likely that gastroesophageal reflux also \nplays a part. This is supported by the fact that there is less \ndrug ingestion in the history of these patients. Schatzki ring \nis probably an acquired lesion that can lead to stenosis from \nchemical-induced injury by pill lodgment in the distal esoph -\nagus, or from reflux-induced injury to the lower esophageal \nmucosa.\nThe best form of treatment of a symptomatic Schatzki ring \nin patients who do not have reflux consists of esophageal dila -\ntion for relief of the obstructive symptoms. In patients with \na ring who have proven reflux and a mechanically defective \nsphincter, an antireflux procedure is necessary to obtain relief \nand avoid repeated dilation.

Horner\u2019s syndrome.Answer: A\nIf the diverticulum is excessively large so that it would be \nredundant if suspended, or if its walls are thickened, a diver -\nticulectomy should be performed. This is best performed \nunder general anesthesia by placing a Maloney dilator (48F) \nin the esophagus, after controlling the neck of the diverticu -\nlum and after myotomy.

Factors that make surgical cure unlikely include a \ntumor >8 cm in length, abnormal axis of the esophagus on \na barium radiogram, more than four enlarged lymph nodes \n(LNs) on computed tomography (CT), a weight loss >20%, and \nloss of appetite. Studies indicate that there are several favor -\nable parameters associated with tumors <4 cm in length, there \nare fewer with tumors between 4 and 8 cm, and there are no \nfavorable criteria for tumors >8 cm in length. Consequently, \nthe finding of a tumor >8 cm in length should exclude cura -\ntive resection; the finding of a smaller tumor should encour -\nage an aggressive approach.

Heller myotomy with complete 360o fundoplicationAnswer: D\nThe third issue\u2014and one that has been long debated\u2014is \nthe question of whether an antireflux procedure should be \nadded to a surgical myotomy. Excellent results have been \nreported following meticulously performed myotomy with -\nout an antireflux component. Retrospective studies, with \nlong-term follow-up of large cohorts of patients undergoing \nHeller myotomy demonstrated that, after 10 years, >50% of \npatients had reflux symptoms without a fundoplication. In a \nrecent randomized clinical trial, 7% of patients undergoing \nDor fundoplication following lower esophageal sphincter \n(LES) myotomy had abnormal 24-hour pH probes, and 42% \nof patients with a myotomy only had abnormal reflux profiles. \nIf an antireflux procedure is used as an adjunct to esophageal \nmyotomy, a complete 360\u00b0 fundoplication should be avoided. \nRather, a 270\u00b0 Belsey fundoplication, a Toupet posterior 180\u00b0 \nfundoplication, or a Dor anterior 180\u00b0 fundoplication should \nbe used to avoid the long-term esophageal dysfunction sec -\nondary to the outflow obstruction afforded by the fundopli -\ncation itself.

Treatment options include all the following \nEXCEPT:\nA. Transthoracic vagotomy.\nB. Oral erythromycin.\nC. High subtotal gastrectomy.\nD. Feeding jejunostomy.Answer: A\nGastric stasis following surgery on the stomach may be due to a \nproblem with gastric motor function or caused by an obstruc -\ntion. The gastric motility abnormality could have been preexist -\ning and unrecognized by the operating surgeon. Alternatively, \nit may be secondary to deliberate or unintentional vagotomy, or \nresection of the dominant gastric pacemaker. An obstruction \nmay be mechanical (eg, anastomotic stricture, efferent limb \nkink from adhesions or constricting mesocolon, or a proxi -\nmal small-bowel obstruction) or functional (eg, retrograde \nperistalsis in a Roux limb). Gastric stasis presents with vomit -\ning (often of undigested food), bloating, epigastric pain, and \nweight loss. Once mechanical obstruction has been ruled out, \nmedical treatment is successful in most cases of motor dysfunc -\ntion following previous gastric surgery. This consists of dietary \nmodification and promotility agents. (If operation is required) \ngastroparesis following subtotal gastric resection is best treated \nwith near-total (95%) or total gastric resection and Roux-en-Y \nreconstruction. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1157\u20131158.)\nThree prokinetic (metoclopramide, erythromycin, dom -\nperidone) may be used to treat delayed gastric emptying.

Presumably the stimulants are similar, but \nacid secretion and intrinsic factor secretion may not be linked. \nIntrinsic factor binds to luminal vitamin B12, and the com -\nplex is absorbed in the terminal ileum via mucosal receptors. \nVitamin B12 deficiency can be life-threatening, and patients \nwith total gastrectomy or pernicious anemia (ie, patients with \nno parietal cells) require B12 supplementation.

Patients with \ngastrinoma usually have a BAO > 15 mEq/h or >5 mEq/h \nif they have had a previous procedure for peptic ulcer. Acid \nsecretory medications should be held for several days before \ngastrin measurement, because acid suppression may falsely \nelevate gastrin levels. Causes of hypergastrinemia can be \ndivided into those associated with hyperacidity and those \nassociated with hypoacidity (see Fig. 26-1). The diagnosis of \nZES is confirmed by the secretin stimulation test. An intra -\nvenous (IV) bolus of secretin (2 U/kg) is given, and gastrin \nlevels are checked before and after injection.

Initial systemic therapy followed by subtotal D2 \ngastrectomy.\nD. Subtotal gastrectomy with removal and assess -\nment of >16 regional lymph nodes and adjuvant \nchemoradiotherapy.\nE. Endoscopic resection.Answer: E\nMultimodality approaches to gastric cancer have become \nwell entrenched with randomized studies from the United \nStates and Europe supporting adjuvant chemoradiotherapy \nand perioperative chemotherapy approaches. Evidence from \nAsia supports adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy with \nextended regional lymphadenectomy (ie, D2 lymphadenec -\ntomy). Although T2N0 cancers were included in some of \nthe randomized trials, such cases were probably underrep -\nresented and the absolute benefit of multimodality therapy \nin this context may not be as great as in the overall cohort \nof patients with locally advanced disease. Selective omission \nof adjuvant therapy in patients with more favorable surgical \npathology may be appropriate.

The lifetime risk of gastric cancer is approximately \n70% in men and 56% in women. Mutation-carrying women \nare at increased risk for breast cancer, typically lobular carci -\nnomas. Because of the poor prognosis associated with clini -\ncal gastric cancer in this setting and limitations of existing \nsurveillance protocols, prophylactic gastrectomy is a consid -\neration in individuals with CDH1 mutations.

Atrophic gastritis.Answer: D\nSome patients with atrophic gastritis develop intestinal \nmetaplasia in the gastric mucosa that may progress to dys -\nplasia and then to gastric cancer. Numerous cofactors have \nbeen implicated, including diet, altered gastric microbiome, \ngenetics, and hypergastrinemia. Patients with atrophic gas -\ntritis are at risk for gastric cancer and should undergo peri -\nodic endoscopic surveillance. Metaplastic atrophic gastritis \nand dysplastic atrophic gastritis in particular are markers of \nincreased risk for gastric cancer.\nBy far the most common precancerous lesion is atrophic \ngastritis. There is a growing appreciation of the important \ninfluence of the chronic inflammatory milieu on the genome \nof mucosal cells. Chronic inflammation leads to both genetic \nand epigenetic changes in mucosal cells, which in the stom -\nach leads to the development of gastritis-associated cancer. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1138\u20131139; 1141\u20131142.)\n 14.

Diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage.\nB. Consideration of enteral access for nutrition support.\nC. Systemic chemotherapy.\nD. Total gastrectomy.\nE. A, B, and C.Answer: E\nDiagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage has emerged as \nan important component of the staging of gastric cancers and \nreveals microscopic or macroscopic disseminated disease in up \nto 36% of cases in published series. Diffuse gastric cancers are \noften diagnosed at an advanced stage. In the context of a clini -\ncal picture consistent with linitis plastica , distant metastasis \nis usually present. Although gross disease may be technically \nresectable with total gastrectomy, initiation of systemic therapy \nis usually a more pressing priority. Enteral access and supple -\nmental nutrition may improve candidacy for systemic therapy \nin selected cases.

Proton pump inhibitors and Carafate.\nB. Beta blockers.\nC. Distal gastrectomy.\nD. Total gastrectomy.Answer: C\nThe parallel red stripes atop the mucosal folds of the distal \nstomach give this rare entity its name. Histologically, gastric \nantral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is characterized by dilated \nmucosal blood vessels that often contain thrombi, in the \nlamina propria. Mucosal fibromuscular hyperplasia and hya -\nlinization often are present (Fig. 26-6).

Chemotherapy +/\u2013 radiation therapy\nC. Wedge resection\nD. AntrectomyAnswer: A\nLow-grade MALT lymphoma, essentially a monoclonal pro -\nliferation of B cells, presumably arises from a background of \nchronic gastritis associated with H. pylori . These relatively \ninnocuous tumors then undergo degeneration to high-grade \nlymphoma, which is the usual variety seen by the surgeon. \nRemarkably, when the H. pylori  is eradicated and the gastritis \nimproves, the low-grade MALT lymphoma often disappears. \nThus, low-grade MALT lymphoma is not a surgical lesion. \nCareful follow-up is necessary particularly in those lesions \nwith a t (11:18) translocation, thought to be a risk factor for a \nmore aggressive MALT lesion.

Have better outcomes than type I and II tumors.Answer: C\nType III gastric neuroendocrine tumors are sporadic. They \nare most often solitary (usually >2 cm) and occur more com -\nmonly in men. They are not associated with hypergastrin -\nemia. Most patients have regional nodal or distant metastases \nat the time of diagnosis, and some present with symptoms of \ncarcinoid syndrome.

Adjuvant Imatinib for at least 3 years.Answer: E\nRisk of GIST recurrence after resection reflects the location \nof the tumor (gastric tumors are less likely to recur than non -\ngastric tumors), size, and mitotic rate. Mitotic rate >5/50 HPF \nis the strongest predictor of recurrence. Patients at higher risk \nof recurrence should be treated with adjuvant Imatinib bar -\nring the presence of a PDGFRA D842V mutation, which is \nassociated with Imatinib resistance.

A tortuous submucosal congenital arteriovenous \nmalformation.\nC. Gastric antral vascular ectasia.\nD. Epithelial hyperplasia and hypergastrinemia.Answer: A\nThere are two clinical syndromes characterized by epithe -\nlial hyperplasia and giant gastric folds: Zollinger-Ellison \nsyndrome (ZES) and M\u00e9n\u00e9trier disease. The latter is char -\nacteristically associated with protein-losing gastropathy and \nhypochlorhydria. There are large rugal folds in the proximal \nstomach, and the antrum is usually spared. Mucosal biopsy \nshows diffuse hyperplasia of the surface mucus-secreting cells \nand usually decreased parietal cells (Fig. 26-7). It has recently \nbeen suggested that M\u00e9n\u00e9trier disease is caused by local over -\nexpression of transforming growth factor-A in the gastric \nmucosa, which stimulates the epidermal growth factor recep -\ntor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, on gastric surface epithelial \ncells (SECs). This results in the selective expansion of surface \nmucous cells in the gastric body and fundus.

Oral glucose for symptoms.\nC. Octreotide.\nD. Surgical conversion to a Roux-en-Y drainage.Answer: C\nA variety of hormonal aberrations have been observed in \nearly dumping, including increased serum levels of vasoactive \nintestinal polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK), neuro -\ntensin, peripheral hormone peptide YY , renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone, and decreased atrial natriuretic peptide. Late \ndumping is associated with hypoglycemia and hyperinsu -\nlinemia. Medical therapy for the dumping syndrome consists \nof dietary modification and somatostatin analogue (octreo -\ntide). (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1157.)Beta blockers and nitrates, useful in the treatment of portal \nhypertensive gastropathy, are ineffective in patients with gas -\ntric antral vascular ectasia. Patients with GAVE are usually \nelderly women with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss \nrequiring transfusion. Most have an associated autoimmune \nconnective tissue disorder, and at least 25% have chronic \nliver disease. Nonsurgical treatment options include estrogen \nand progesterone, and endoscopic treatment with the neo -\ndymium yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser or argon \nplasma coagulator. Antrectomy may be required to control \nblood loss, and this operation is quite effective but carries \nincreased morbidity in this elderly patient group.

Reduced ghrelin production.\nB. Increased secretion of GLP-1.\nC. Appetite suppression.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nGastrectomy removes much of the ghrelin-producing portion \nof the stomach and this mechanism is thought to contribute \nto weight loss after both gastric sleeve and RYGB procedures. \nGLP-1, the enteric hormone which augments insulin release, \nis dramatically increased after RYGB, and is increased after \nthe gastric sleeve procedure as well. A profound suppression \nof appetite and food craving has been found to follow these \nprocedures, presumably due to the altered hormonal status of \npeptides which affect the satiety centers of the central  nervous \nsystem. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1175.) 7. Complications which are associated with the gastric \nsleeve procedure include:\nA. Leak from the gastric staple line.\nB. Gastroesophageal reflux.\nC. Stenosis of the gastric sleeve.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nThe gastric sleeve procedure creates a high pressure tube. \nThis places the gastric staple line at risk for leak, and addi -\ntional buttress sutures are frequently used to reinforce the \nstaple line. The high pressure also increases the probability \nof gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) so patients with a \nhistory of GERD are less favorable candidates for the gastric \nsleeve procedure. The gastric tube itself is usually constructed \nover a 40-French bougie. If a smaller bougie is used, the risk \nof leak and reflux are increased and stenosis of the gastric \nsleeve or tube may occur. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1186.) 6. A late complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is \nthe development of post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia \n(PGBH) due to inappropriately elevated insulin levels. \nRecommended treatments of this condition include all \nof the following EXCEPT:\nA. Very low carbohydrate diet.\nB. Anti-secretory agents such as diazoxide and \nsomatostatin.\nC. GLP-1 receptor antagonists.\nD. Pancreatic resection.Answer: D\nPGBH occurs in some patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \ndue to exaggerated or excessive insulin levels. It is thought to \nbe a consequence of greatly increased GLP-1 levels seen in \nsome patients. A very low carbohydrate diet may provide relief \nin some patients, and diazoxide and somatostatin have been \nused in those who fail diet therapy. Recently GLP-1 recep -\ntor antagonists have been reported to be successful. Although \npancreatic resection was initially reported in patients with \nsevere hypoglycemia, it is no longer recommended. Partial \npancreatectomy results in a recurrence of the problem, and \ntotal pancreatectomy exchanges one severe condition for \nanother. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1204\u20131205.) 5. Small bowel obstruction after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n(RYGB) should be treated as an urgent surgical emer -\ngency because:\nA. It is frequently due to an incarcerated internal hernia \nwhich can progress to bowel necrosis and perforation.\nB. Abdominal distension risks disruption of suture lines.\nC. Signs and symptoms of peritonitis, such as pain, fever, \nand leukocytosis, are usually masked in the obese.\nD. Nasogastric intubation will not decompress the distal \ngastric remnant.Answer: A\nSmall bowel obstruction after RYGB is frequently due to an \nincarcerated internal hernia at the location of the closure, or lack \nthereof, of the mesenteric defect. This can progress rapidly to \nstrangulation and necrosis of the bowel with subsequent perfo -\nration. Adverse outcomes with this complication have resulted \nin the uniform recommendation that small bowel obstruc -\ntion in this setting should be regarded as a surgical emergency. \nAbdominal distention and difficulties with nasogastric intuba -\ntion are not relevant concerns. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1184.)\n 9. Adolescent patients with morbid obesity are increasingly \nbeing referred for consideration of bariatric procedures \ndue to failure of medical management and the risks \nassociated with a lifetime of obesity. What nutritional \ndeficiencies require lifelong treatment after Roux-en-\nY gastric bypass (RYGB), the most common procedure \nperformed in this age group?\nA. Pernicious anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency\nB. Iron deficiency anemia\nC. Deficiencies of vitamins A, E, D, and K\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nLoss of intrinsic factor produced in the gastric fundus, \nimpaired iron absorption, and a deficiency of the fat-soluble \nvitamins present lifelong risks after RYGB and other mal -\nabsorptive bariatric procedures. Vitamin replacement and \nnutritional monitoring are therefore mandatory in bariatric \npatients.

Larger vasa recta\nD. Less fatty mesenteryAnswer: B\nThe entire small intestine contains valvulae conniventes, \nalso known as plicae circularis. The jejunum has larger vasa \nrecta, a larger diameter, and a less fatty mesentery. The ileum \ncontains prominent lymphoid follicles called Peyer patches. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1220.) 1.

Increased intraluminal pressure.\nC. A persistent vitelline duct.\nD. A mutation of the c-Mec gene.Answer: C\nThe embryonic gut communicates with the yolk sac by mean \nof the vitelline duct. Failure of this structure to obliterate \nby the end of gestation can result in a Meckel diverticulum. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1246\u20131247.)\n 4. The most common presentations of symptomatic Meckel \ndiverticuli include all of the following EXCEPT:\nA. Bleeding.\nB. Intestinal obstruction.\nC. Inguinal pain.\nD. Diverticulitis.Answer: C\nBleeding, intestinal obstruction, and diverticulitis are the \nmost common presenting symptoms of Meckel diverticuli. \nMost are discovered incidentally at surgical procedures. \n Inguinal pain is not a typical symptom.

The radiologic evaluation of a suspected small bowel \nobstruction may require use of a contrast agent to con -\nfirm the location and possible etiology of the obstruc -\ntion. Water-soluble contrast agents, such as gastrograffin, \nare preferable to barium for all of the following reasons \nEXCEPT:\nA. Gastrograffin is safer than barium if a perforation has \noccurred.\nB. Gastrograffin may facilitate the resolution of a partial \nsmall bowel obstruction.\nC. Gastrograffin small bowel studies are easier to \nperform.\nD. Gastrograffin may detect subtle mucosal abnormali -\nties more sensitively than barium.Answer: C\nWater-soluble contrast agents, such as gastrograffin, are less \nlikely to provoke peritonitis if a perforation has occurred and \nmay be more sensitive in the detection of mucosal abnormali -\nties. Gastrograffin has also been shown to be therapeutic for \nthe treatment of partial small bowel obstruction, but gastro -\ngraffin studies take longer and are more labor-intensive to \nperform.

Dendritic cells.\nD. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.Answer: B\nThe GALT includes Peyer patches, which are microscopic \naggregates of B-cell follicles and intervening T-cell areas \nfound in the lamina propria of the small intestine, primar -\nily in the distal ileum. IgA-producing plasma cells and den -\ndritic cells populate these regions and serve to protect against \nmicrobes and foreign pathogens. Stellate cells, which produce \ncollagen when activated, are not contained within the GALT. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1226.) 7. What does the \u201centerohepatic circulation\u201d refer to?\nA. The superior mesenteric\u2014portal venous circuit\nB. The secretion of cholesterol in the bile and its reab -\nsorption in the distal ileum\nC. The secretion of bile acids by the liver and their reab -\nsorption in the distal ileum\nD. The secretion of cholecystokinin by the jejunum and \nits stimulation of bile flowAnswer: C\nBile acids act as detergents which increase the solubility \nof lipid micelles which are taken up by the brush border \n membrane of the jejunum, where >90% of fat is absorbed. \nThe bile acids themselves remain in the intestinal lumen \nand are reabsorbed in the distal ileum where they enter \nthe portal venous  circulation and are resecreted in the bile. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1225.) 6. How are the digestion products of carbohydrates, such \nas glucose, galactose, and fructose, absorbed through the \nintestine?\nA. By passive diffusion across enterocyte plasma \nmembranes\nB. By facilitated diffusion via specific transporters such \nas SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5\nC. By endocytosis of enterocytes on the villus\nD. By facilitated diffusion through tight junctions \nbetween enterocytesAnswer: B\nThe three terminal products of carbohydrate digestion are \ntransported through the enterocyte brush border membrane \nvia facilitative transporter proteins such as the sodium- \nglucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1), glucose transporter 2 \n(GLUT2) and glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5). There is \nevidence of overexpression of these transporters, particu -\nlarly SGLT1, in diabetes and obesity, and new therapeutic \napproaches for these conditions are designed to inhibit these \ntransporters.

The obstruction is painless.\nC. Bacterial overgrowth results in sepsis.\nD. The obstructive segment is not apparent on imaging \nstudies.Answer: A\nA closed loop obstruction, in which an intestinal segment is \nobstructed both proximally and distally, as in a volvulus, is \nparticularly dangerous because intraluminal pressure rises \nquickly and can cause venous congestion and arterial obstruc -\ntion which leads to necrosis of the intestinal wall and perfo -\nration. It classically presents with \u201cpain out of proportion to \nthe physical exam, \u201d and is usually apparent on CT scan which \nfrequently shows a U-shaped or C- shaped dilated bowel loop \nassociated with a radial distribution of mesenteric vessels \nconverging toward a torsion point.

Laparoscopic surgery is associated with fewer wound \ninfections and a shorter length of hospital stay.\nB. Laparoscopic surgery is preferable in cases where a \nsingle adhesive band is causing the obstruction.\nC. Laparoscopic surgery is less likely to produce fur -\nther adhesion formation which may cause recurrent \nobstruction.\nD. The risk of iatrogenic bowel injury is higher with \nlaparoscopic surgery.Answer: D\nThe use of laparoscopic surgery for small bowel obstruction \nhas been found to be highly successful when the obstruction \nis caused by a single adhesive band. The avoidance of an open \nprocedure also reduces the risk of subsequent adhesion for -\nmation. The morbidity risks of laparoscopic surgery are less \nthan with open surgery and the risk of iatrogenic injury to the \nbowel is similar. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1232.)\n 13. Crohn\u2019s disease affects the small intestine in 80% of \ncases, and the colon alone in 20%. Isolated perineal and  \nanorectal disease occurs in 5% to 10% of patients. In addi -\ntion, extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease  \noccur in up to 25% of patients and may include which of \nthe following?\nA. Erythema nodosum\nB. Interstitial lung disease\nC. Nephrolithiasis\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nExtraintestinal manifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease are diffuse \nand can involve dermatologic, rheumatologic, ocular, hepa -\ntobiliary, urologic, and pulmonary conditions. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1237.)\n 14. The primary genetic defect associated with Crohn\u2019s dis -\nease is a mutation of the NOD2 gene on chromosome 16. \nThis gene encodes for a protein product which:\nA. Mediates the innate immune response to microbial \npathogens.\nB. Activates stellate cells to produce collagen.\nC. Regulates the rate of crypt-to-villus enterocyte \nmigration.\nD. Mediates the production of enterocyte alkaline \nphosphatase.Answer: A\nThe protein product of the NOD2 gene mediates the innate \nimmune response to microbial pathogens. A variety of defects \nin immune regulatory mechanisms such as over responsive -\nness of mucosal T cells to enteric flora-derived antigens can \nlead to defective immune tolerance and sustained inflamma -\ntion. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1236.) 11. Therapy of a small bowel obstruction usually consists of \nprompt surgical correction. In patients with no evidence \nof closed loop obstruction, and in whom there is no fever \nor leukocytosis or tachycardia, a period of careful obser -\nvation with nasogastric decompression may be success -\nful in all of the following conditions EXCEPT:\nA. Partial small bowel obstruction.\nB. Obstruction in the early postoperative period.\nC. Obstruction due to Crohn disease.\nD. Obstruction due to an internal hernia.Answer: D\nPartial small bowel obstruction and early postoperative \nobstruction can mimic ileus and may respond to nonop -\nerative therapy. Crohn disease usually responds to medical \ntherapy, although recurrent obstruction is an indication for \nsurgical correction. Obstruction due to an internal hernia \nrequires prompt surgical intervention to avoid strangulation \nand necrosis. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1231.)\n 15. In the resection of a stenotic area of intestine in a patient \nwith Crohn\u2019s disease, the best approach is:\nA. A resection margin of 2 cm from gross disease.\nB. A resection margin of 12 cm from gross disease.\nC. A resection margin of 2 cm from microscopic disease \non frozen section.\nD. A resection margin of 12 cm from microscopic \n disease on frozen section.Answer: A\nThere are no differences in the recurrence rates for resection \nwith a 2 cm margin or a 12 cm margin from gross disease. \nThe additional bowel lost may contribute to eventual short \ngut syndrome in a patient who requires multiple resections, \nso minimizing bowel loss is a priority. There is no benefit to \nachieving frozen section negative margins in the resection  \nof Crohn\u2019s strictures; positive margin resections have the same  \nrecurrence rate as negative margin resections. The effort  \nto obtain a frozen section negative margin carries the risk  \nof removing more intestine than is necessary.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nD. Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) syndromeAnswer: B\nDuodenal carcinoma is a late manifestation of the FAP \nsyndrome. After resolution of the colonic disease by total \n colectomy, patients with FAP must be followed with periodic \nupper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy to maintain surveil -\nlance for duodenal tumors.

GISTs are usually metastatic when first diagnosed.\nC. GISTs typically present with gastrointestinal \nhemorrhage.\nD. GISTs are usually responsive to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy.Answer: C\nGISTs are a form of sarcoma which occur most commonly \n(70%) in the stomach, but comprise 10% to 15% of small \nbowel malignancies. They more frequently present with gas -\ntrointestinal hemorrhage than other small bowel malignan -\ncies. They are usually refractory to conventional cytotoxic \nchemotherapy but are not usually metastatic on initial diag -\nnosis. A radical lymphadenectomy is not usually required; a \nsegmental resection of the involved portion of the small intes -\ntine is usually sufficient surgical treatment. Imatinib, but not \ncytotoxic chemotherapy, has been shown to be therapeutic \nfor unresectable or metastatic disease. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \npp. 1242\u20131245.) 16. The failure of an enterocutaneous fistula to heal on a \nregimen of total parenteral nutrition and anti-secretory \ntherapy may be due to which of the following?\nA. A foreign body in the fistula tract\nB. Epithelialization of the fistula tract\nC. Down-stream obstruction of the fistulized segment \nof intestine\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nFactors which prevent healing of an entero-cutaneous fistula \ninclude foreign body, epithelialization of the fistula tract, \ndown-stream obstruction, radiation enteritis, associated \ninfection (abscess or sepsis), malignancy, and a short (<2 cm) \nfistula tract.

Placement of an absorbable mesh sling to suspend \nsmall intestine out of the pelvis during postoperative \nradiation therapy\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nIn addition to limiting radiation exposure to <5000 cGy, \navoiding radiation to the small intestine after pelvic surgery \ncan involve steep Trendelenberg positioning during radiation \ntherapy sessions, closure of the pelvic peritoneum at the level \nof the sacral promontory to prevent small bowel filling the \npelvis, and creating of an absorbable mesh sling to prevent \nthe small intestine from filling the pelvic cavity.

Defecation involves contraction of the puborectalis \nmuscle.\nC. The internal and external anal sphincter muscles are \nactive at rest.\nD. Hemorrhoidal cushions have no role in fecal \ncontinence.Answer: C\nDefecation . Defecation is a complex, coordinated mecha -\nnism involving colonic mass movement, increased intra- \nabdominal and rectal pressure, and relaxation of the pelvic \nfloor. Distention of the rectum causes a reflex relaxation of \nthe internal anal sphincter (the rectoanal inhibitory reflex) \nthat allows the contents to make contact with the anal canal. \nThis \u201csampling reflex\u201d allows the sensory epithelium to dis -\ntinguish solid stool from liquid stool and gas. If defecation \ndoes not occur, the rectum relaxes and the urge to defecate \npasses ( accommodation response ). Defecation proceeds by \ncoordinating increasing intra-abdominal pressure via a \n Valsalva maneuver with rectal contraction, relaxation of the \npuborectalis muscle, and opening of the anal canal.\nContinence . The maintenance of fecal continence is at \nleast as complex as the mechanism of defecation. Continence \nrequires adequate rectal wall compliance to accommodate the \nfecal bolus, appropriate neurogenic control of the pelvic floor \nand sphincter mechanism, and functional internal and exter -\nnal sphincter muscles. At rest, the puborectalis muscle creates \na \u201csling\u201d around the distal rectum, forming a relatively acute \nangle that distributes intra-abdominal forces onto the pelvic \nfloor. With defecation, this angle straightens, allowing down -\nward force to be applied along the axis of the rectum and anal \ncanal. The internal and external sphincters are tonically active \nat rest. The internal sphincter is responsible for most of the rest -\ning, involuntary sphincter tone (resting pressure). The external \nsphincter is responsible for most of the voluntary sphincter  1. A patient presents for evaluation of blood with wiping \nand is found to have an ulcerated lesion at the anal verge, \nwhich is biopsied and results as anal squamous cell car -\ncinoma. How should this patient be first assessed for \nlymph node involvement?\nA. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis to \nassess for inferior mesenteric or internal iliac nodes\nB. Whole body positron emission tomography-CT \n(PET-CT)\nC. Clinical examination of inguinal nodesAnswer: C\nAnorectal lymphatic drainage . Lymphatic drainage of \nthe rectum parallels the vascular supply. Lymphatic chan -\nnels in the upper and middle rectum drain superiorly into \nthe inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. Lymphatic channels \nin the lower rectum drain both superiorly into the inferior \nmesenteric lymph nodes and laterally into the internal iliac \nlymph nodes. The anal canal has a more complex pattern \nof lymphatic drainage. Proximal to the dentate line, lymph \ndrains into both the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes and the \ninternal iliac lymph nodes. Distal to the dentate line, lymph \nprimarily drains into the inguinal lymph nodes, but can also \ndrain into the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes and internal \niliac lymph nodes.

Identification of involved perirectal lymph nodes via \nultrasound is possible in most cases.Answer: A\nEndorectal and endoanal ultrasound . Endorectal ultrasound \nis primarily used to evaluate the depth of invasion of neoplas -\ntic lesions in the rectum. The normal rectal wall appears as a \nfive-layer structure (Fig. 29-1). Ultrasound can reliably differ -\nentiate most benign polyps from invasive tumors based on the \nintegrity of the submucosal layer. Ultrasound can also differ -\nentiate superficial T1-T2 from deeper T3-T4 tumors. Overall, \nthe accuracy of ultrasound in detecting depth of mural inva -\nsion ranges between 81% and 94%. This modality also can \ndetect enlarged perirectal lymph nodes, which may suggest tone (squeeze pressure). Branches of the pudendal nerve inner -\nvate both the internal and external sphincter. The hemor -\nrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically \nblocking the anal canal. Finally, liquid stools exacerbate abnor -\nmalities with these anatomic and physiologic mechanisms, so \na formed stool contributes to maintaining continence. Thus, \nimpaired continence may result from poor rectal compliance, \ninjury to the internal and/or external sphincter or puborectalis, \nor neuropathy.

Earlier return of bowel function\nD. Less expensive\nE. All of the above\nF. A-CAnswer: F\nMinimally invasive techniques of resection . With advances \nin minimally invasive technology, many procedures that \npreviously have required laparotomy can now be performed \nlaparoscopically, with hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL), or \nrobotically. Potential advantages of minimally invasive sur -\ngery include improved cosmetic result, decreased postop -\nerative pain, and earlier return of bowel function. Moreover, \nsome experimental data suggest that minimally invasive oper -\nations have less immunosuppressive impact on the patient \nand thus might improve postoperative outcome and even \nlong-term survival. To date, most studies have demonstrated \nequivalence between laparoscopic, HAL, and open resection \nin terms of extent of resection. Return of bowel function and \nlength of hospital stay are highly variable. Long-term out -\ncome has yet to be determined; however, short-term quality \nof life appears to be improved by laparoscopy. Laparoscopic \ntotal mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, however, may not \nbe appropriate. The most recent advances in minimally inva -\nsive surgery involve use of robotics  and telemanipulation  in \nwhich the surgeon operates from a console remote from the \npatient. These procedures have been rapidly gaining in popu -\nlarity, especially for pelvic and rectal resections. Early studies \nsuggest equivalence between robotic resections and laparo -\nscopic/HAL resections.\nIn addition, some proponents have suggested that robotic \nprocedures may be easier to learn (a shorter \u201clearning curve\u201d) \nand that robotic surgery may be ergonomically better for \nthe operating surgeon. Nevertheless, long-term superior -\nity, or even equivalence, has yet to be demonstrated, and \nthese advanced technologies are likely to be associated with \n significant cost.

Right colectomy: ileocolic, right colic, and right \nbranches of middle colic vessels\nB. Total abdominal colectomy: ileocolic, right colic, \nmiddle colic, left colic, sigmoidal, and superior rectal \nvessels\nC.

Extended right colectomy: ileocolic, right colic, and \nmiddle colic vessels\nF. Left colectomy: left branches of middle colic, left \ncolic, and first branch of sigmoid vesselsAnswer: B\nRight colectomy.  A right colectomy is used to remove lesions \nor disease in the right colon and is oncologically the most \nappropriate operation for curative intent resection of proxi -\nmal colon carcinoma. The ileocolic vessels, right colic vessels, \nand right branches of the middle colic vessels are ligated and \ndivided. Approximately 10 cm of terminal ileum are usually \nincluded in the resection. A primary ileal-transverse colon \nanastomosis is almost always possible.\nExtended right colectomy.  An extended right colectomy \nmay be used for curative intent resection of lesions located at \nthe hepatic flexure or proximal transverse colon. A standard \nright colectomy is extended to include ligation of the middle \ncolic vessels at their base. The right colon and proximal trans -\nverse colon are resected, and a primary anastomosis is created \nbetween the distal ileum and distal transverse colon. Such an \nanastomosis relies on the marginal artery of Drummond. If \nthe blood supply to the distal transverse colon is question -\nable, the resection is extended distally beyond the splenic \nflexure to well-perfused descending colon where the ileocolic \n anastomosis can be performed safely.\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   243 30/06/22   11:24 AM"

Y ou are the chief resident performing an intestinal anas -\ntomosis with the help of your intern, who requests that \nyou share some useful facts about anastomoses. Which \nof the following would be wrong to teach your intern?\nA. Hand-sutured anastomoses leak less frequently than \nstapled anastomoses.\nB. The colon should be mobilized as much as needed to \nensure a tension-free anastomosis to the rectum.\nC. The submucosal layer provides strength to an \nanastomosis.\nD. Performing an anastomosis in the setting of feculent \nperitonitis would increase the chances of anastomotic \nleak.Answer: A\nAnastomoses.  Anastomoses may be created between two seg -\nments of bowel in a multitude of ways. The geometry of the \nanastomosis may be end-to-end, end-to-side, side-to-end , or \nside-to-side . The anastomotic technique may be hand-sewn  or \nstapled  (Fig. 29-2). The submucosal layer of the intestine pro -\nvides the strength of the bowel wall and must be incorporated \nin the anastomosis to assure healing. The choice of anastomo -\nsis depends on the operative anatomy and surgeon preference. \nAlthough many surgeons advocate one method over another, \nnone has been proven to be superior. Accurate approximation \nof two well-vascularized, healthy limbs of bowel without tension \nin a normotensive, well-nourished patient almost always results \nin a good outcome. Anastomoses at highest risk of leak or stric -\nture are those that are in the distal rectal or anal canal, involve \nirradiated or diseased intestine including perforation with peri -\ntoneal soilage, are inadvertently fashioned above a partial distal \nobstruction, or are performed in malnourished, immunosup -\npressed, or ill patient. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1274.)Transverse colectomy.  Lesions in the mid and distal trans -\nverse colon may be resected by ligating the middle colic \nvessels and resecting the transverse colon, followed by a \ncolocolonic anastomosis. However, an extended right colec -\ntomy with an anastomosis between the terminal ileum and \ndescending colon may be a safer anastomosis with an equiva -\nlent functional result.\nLeft colectomy.  For lesions or disease states confined to the \ndistal transverse colon, splenic flexure, or descending colon, \na left colectomy is performed. The left branches of the middle \ncolic vessels, the left colic vessels, and the first branches of \nthe sigmoid vessels are ligated. A colocolonic anastomosis can \nusually be performed.\nExtended left colectomy.  An extended left colectomy is an \noption for removing lesions in the distal transverse colon. In \nthis operation, the left colectomy is extended proximally to \ninclude the right branches of the middle colic vessels.\nSigmoid colectomy.  Lesions in the sigmoid colon require \nligation and division of the sigmoid branches of the infe -\nrior mesenteric artery. In general, the entire sigmoid colon \nshould be resected to the level of the peritoneal reflection and \nan anastomosis created between the descending colon and \nupper rectum. Full mobilization of the splenic flexure is often \nrequired to create a tension-free anastomosis.\nTotal and subtotal colectomy.  Total or subtotal colectomy \nis occasionally required for patients with fulminant colitis, \nattenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), or synchro -\nnous colon carcinomas. In this procedure, the ileocolic vessels, \nright colic vessels, middle colic vessels, and left colic vessels are \nligated and divided. The superior rectal vessels are preserved. If \nit is desired to preserve the sigmoid, the distal sigmoid vessels \nare left intact, and an anastomosis is created between the ileum \nand distal sigmoid colon (subtotal colectomy with  ileosigmoid \nanastomosis). If the sigmoid is to be resected, the sigmoidal \nvessels are ligated and divided, and the ileum is anastomosed \nto the upper rectum (total abdominal colectomy with ileorec -\ntal anastomosis). If an anastomosis is contraindicated, an end \nileostomy is created, and the remaining sigmoid or rectum \nis managed either as a mucus fistula or a Hartmann pouch. \n(See Sch wartz 11th ed., pp. 1270\u20131272.)\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   244 30/06/22   11:24 AM"

Which of the following extraintestinal manifestations \nof inflammatory bowel disease cannot be improved by \ntreatment of colonic disease?\nA. Fatty infiltration of the liver\nB. Primary sclerosing cholangitis\nC. Arthritis\nD. Erythema nodosumAnswer: B\nExtraintestinal manifestations . The liver is a common site \nof extracolonic disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Fatty \ninfiltration of the liver is present in 40% to 50% of patients, \nand cirrhosis is found in 2% to 5%. Fatty infiltration may be \nreversed by medical or surgical treatment of colonic disease, \nbut cirrhosis is irreversible. Primary sclerosing cholangitis \nis a progressive disease characterized by intra and extrahe -\npatic bile duct strictures. Forty percent to 60% of patients \nwith primary sclerosing cholangitis have ulcerative colitis. \nColectomy will not reverse this disease, and the only effective \ntherapy is liver transplantation. Pericholangitis is also associ -\nated with inflammatory bowel disease and may be diagnosed \nwith a liver biopsy. Bile duct carcinoma is a rare complication \nof long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. Patients who \ndevelop bile duct carcinoma in the presence of inflammatory \nbowel disease are, on average, 20 years younger than other \npatients with bile duct carcinoma.\nArthritis also is a common extracolonic manifestation of \ninflammatory bowel disease, and the incidence is 20 times \ngreater than in the general population.

The medical student on the colorectal surgery service \nastutely notes that patients who have undergone colecto -\nmies tend to have higher incisional infection rates than \npatients on other services. Y ou decide to review methods \nfor reducing surgical site infections with her. Which of \nthe following is not TRUE?\nA. Mechanical bowel preparation is thought to help \nclear the colon of bacteria.\nB. Preoperative oral antibiotics can help reduce the \nrate of incisional infection, even when a mechanical \nbowel prep is not used.\nC. Routine postoperative intravenous (IV) antibiotics \nhave no role in an uncomplicated colectomy.\nD. Prophylactic IV antibiotics should only be given \nbefore incision regardless of the length of the opera -\ntion, as additional doses during an operation can lead \nto antibiotic resistance.Answer: D\nBowel preparation . The rationale for bowel preparation is \nthat decreasing the bacterial load in the colon and rectum will \ndecrease the incidence of postoperative infection. Mechanical \nbowel preparation  uses cathartics to rid the colon of solid stool \nthe night before surgery. The most commonly used regimens \ninclude polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions or magnesium \ncitrate. PEG solutions require patients to drink a large volume \nof fluid and may cause bloating and nausea. Magnesium citrate \nsolutions are generally better tolerated but are more likely to \ncause fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Both are equally \nefficacious in bowel cleansing. Preparatory formulations \nhave been recently introduced in tablet form in an attempt to \nimprove tolerance. However, these methods of bowel cleansing \nrequire ingestion of \u226540 tablets with water over several hours. \nTo date, these formulations have not been proven to be supe -\nrior to the more traditional products.  Antibiotic prophylaxis  \nalso is recommended. The addition of oral antibiotics to the \npreoperative mechanical bowel preparation has been thought \nto decrease postoperative infection by further decreasing the \nbacterial load of the colon. A recent analysis of the Surgical \nCare Improvement Project-1 (SCIP-1) suggests that oral anti -\nbiotics reduce postoperative wound infection, especially if a \nmechanical bowel preparation is not used.\nLong-standing, convincing data support the efficacy of par -\nenteral antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of surgery. Broad-\nspectrum parenteral antibiotic(s) with activity against aerobic \nand anaerobic enteric pathogens should be administered just \nprior to the skin incision and redosed as needed depending \non the length of the operation. There is no proven benefit to \nusing antibiotics postoperatively after an uncomplicated col -\nectomy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1279.)\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   246 30/06/22   11:25 AM"

Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated in \nthe outpatient setting.\nB. Hospitalized patients who fail to improve should be \nassessed with a computed tomography (CT) scan for \nabscess formation.\nC. Worsening abdominal pain in a patient hospitalized \nwith diverticulitis should be addressed with broaden -\ning of antibiotics.\nD. Most patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis will \nnever have another episode.Answer: C\nUncomplicated diverticulitis . Uncomplicated diverticulitis  is \ncharacterized by left lower quadrant pain and tenderness. CT \nfindings include pericolic soft tissue stranding, colonic wall \nthickening, and/or phlegmon. Most patients with uncompli -\ncated diverticulitis will respond to outpatient therapy with \nbroad-spectrum oral antibiotics and a low-residue diet. Anti -\nbiotics should be continued for 7 to 10 days. About 10% to \n20% of patients with more severe pain, tenderness, fever, and \nleukocytosis are treated in the hospital with parenteral anti -\nbiotics and bowel rest. Most patients improve within 48 to \n72 hours. Failure to improve may suggest abscess formation. \nCT can be extremely useful in this setting, and many pericolic \nabscesses can be drained percutaneously.

It has long been believed that the risk of complications \nincreases with recurrent disease. For this reason, elective sig -\nmoid colectomy has often been recommended after the second \nepisode of diverticulitis, especially if the patient has required \nhospitalization. Resection has often been recommended after \nthe first episode in very young patients and is often recom -\nmended after the first episode of complicated diverticulitis . \nThese general guidelines have been questioned in recent years, \nand more recent studies suggest that the risk of complications \nand/or need for emergent resection does not increase with \nrecurrent disease. Moreover, the rate of complications is rare \nafter elective surgery and recurrences do not increase the rate \nof complications. As such, the rate of resection in all patients, \nincluding young patients and those with complicated disease, \nhas decreased. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1286 \u20131287 .)\n 11.

Two affected generationsAnswer: B\nLynch syndrome (HNPCC).  Lynch syndrome is more com -\nmon than familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but it is \nstill extremely rare (1%\u20133% of all colon cancers). The genetic \ndefects associated with Lynch syndrome arise from errors in \nmismatch repair , the phenotypic result being microsatellite \ninstable (MSI). Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autoso -\nmal dominant pattern and is characterized by the develop -\nment of colorectal carcinoma at an early age (average age, \n40\u201345 years). Approximately 70% of affected individuals will \ndevelop colorectal cancer. Cancers appear in the proximal \ncolon more often than in sporadic colorectal cancer and have \na better prognosis regardless of stage. The risk of synchronous \nor metachronous colorectal carcinoma is 40%. Lynch syn -\ndrome may also be associated with extracolonic malignancies, \nincluding endometrial carcinoma, which is most common in \nwomen, and ovarian, pancreas, stomach, small bowel, biliary, \nand urinary tract carcinomas. The diagnosis is made based \non family history. The Amsterdam I criteria  for clinical diag -\nnosis of Lynch syndrome are three affected relatives with his -\ntologically verified adenocarcinoma of the large bowel (one Erythema nodosum is seen in 5% to 15% of patients with \ninflammatory bowel disease and usually coincides with \n clinical disease activity.

T4N1M0, stage II\nC. T3N1M0, stage III\nD. T4N1M0, stage IIIAnswer: C\nStaging . Colorectal cancer staging is based on tumor depth \nand the presence or absence of nodal or distant metastases. \nOlder staging systems, such as the Dukes\u2019 Classification and \nits Astler-Coller modification, have been replaced by the TNM \nstaging system described by the American Joint Committee \non Cancer (AJCC). The AJCC TNM classification has recently \nbeen updated to reflect survival outcomes based upon the  \nSurveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry. \nStage I disease includes adenocarcinomas that are invasive \nthrough the muscularis mucosa but are confined to the sub -\nmucosa (T1) or the muscularis propria (T2) in the absence \nof nodal metastases. Stage II disease consists of tumors that \ninvade through the bowel wall into the subserosa or non -\nperitonealized pericolic or perirectal tissues (T3) or into \nother organs or tissues or through the visceral peritoneum \n(T4) without nodal metastases. Stage III disease includes any  \nT stage with nodal metastases, and stage IV  disease denotes \ndistant metastases. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1296.)\n 13. How can the role of adjuvant chemotherapy following \nresection of colon cancer be most accurately described?\nA. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be used after all \ncolon cancer resections to reduce the risk of recur -\nrence and improve overall survival.\nB. Adjuvant chemotherapy has the best evidence for \nroutine use in those with positive lymph nodes.\nC. Microsatellite instable (MSI)-high patients do not \nrespond to adjuvant chemotherapy and therefore \nshould not be offered it.\nD. As long as lymph nodes are negative, patients \nwith stage II disease do not benefit from adjuvant \nchemotherapy.Answer: B\nStages I and II: Localized colon carcinoma (T1-3, N0, M0).  \nThe majority of patients with stages I and II colon cancer will \nbe cured with surgical resection. Few patients with completely \nresected stage I disease will develop either local or distant \nrecurrence, and adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve \nsurvival in these patients. However, up to 46% of patients \nwith completely resected stage II disease will ultimately die \nfrom colon cancer. For this reason, adjuvant chemotherapy \nhas been suggested for selected patients with stage II disease \n(young patients, tumors with \u201chigh-risk\u201d histologic findings). \nIt remains controversial as to whether chemotherapy improves \nsurvival rates in these patients. In some cases, molecular pro -\nfiling may predict prognosis, although it is important to note \nthat these tools have not been shown to predict response to \ntherapy. At present, molecular profiling for selecting patients \nto receive chemotherapy remains unproven.\nStage III: Lymph node metastasis (Tany, N1, M0).  Patients \nwith lymph node involvement are at significant risk for both \nlocal and distant recurrence, and adjuvant chemotherapy has \nbeen recommended routinely in these patients. 5- Fluorouracil\u2013\nbased regimens (with leucovorin) and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) \nreduce recurrences and improve survival in this patient pop -\nulation. It is important to note, however, that a subgroup of must be a first-degree relative of one of the others) in two \nsuccessive generations of a family with one patient diagnosed \nbefore age 50 years. The presence of other related carcino -\nmas should raise the suspicion of this syndrome. Revised cri -\nteria Amsterdam II  requires three or more relatives with an \nHNPCC-related malignancy in which at least one is a first-\ndegree relative of the others, two generations are affected, at \nleast one cancer occurred before age 50, familial adenoma -\ntous polyposis (FAP) has been excluded, and pathology of the \ntumors has been reviewed and confirmed. In a patient with \nan established diagnosis of colorectal cancer, tumor testing \nfor presence of mismatch repair gene products (immunohis -\ntochemistry) and/or MSI can sometimes serve as screening \nfor this syndrome.

Molecular profiling, \ntherefore, may be helpful in determining which stage III \npatients can safely avoid systemic chemotherapy. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., pp. 1298 \u20131299 .)\n 14. Which of the following statements about total mesorec -\ntal excision (TME) for rectal cancer is TRUE?\nA. TME improves local recurrence but not long-term \nsurvival.\nB. TME is not necessary for rectosigmoid tumors.\nC. TME is associated with less blood loss than a blunt \ndissection.\nD. TME carries a higher risk of injury to the pelvic \nnerves than a blunt dissection.Answer: C\nTotal mesorectal excision (TME)  is a technique that uses sharp \ndissection along anatomic planes to ensure complete resection \nof the rectal mesentery during low and extended low anterior \nresections. For upper rectal or rectosigmoid resections, a partial \nmesorectal excision of at least 5 cm distal to the tumor appears \nadequate. TME both decreases local recurrence rates and \nimproves long-term survival rates. Moreover, this technique is \nassociated with less blood loss and less risk to the pelvic nerves \nand presacral plexus than is blunt dissection. The principles of \nTME should be applied to all radical resections for rectal can -\ncer. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1300.)\n 15. Y ou encounter an unfamiliar-appearing mass when per -\nforming a colonoscopy. Y our attending, who is standing \nnext to you, surmises that this is a leiomyoma of the colon \nand asks how you plan to manage it. How do you respond?\nA. If the lesion is small and asymptomatic, it should be \nleft alone.\nB. The lesion should be excised only if it is >5 cm due to \nthe risk of malignancy at this size.\nC. All leiomyomas should be resected because malig -\nnancy (leiomyosarcoma) cannot be ruled out.\nD. Oncologic (radical) resections are always indicated \nfor leiomyoma, regardless of size, due to the high \nlikelihood of malignancy.Answer: C\nLeiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma . Leiomyomas are benign \ntumors of the smooth muscle of the bowel wall and occur most \ncommonly in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Most patients \nare asymptomatic, and lesions are often diagnosed incidentally \nwhen a mass is seen on endoscopy or felt on digital rectal exami -\nnation. However, large lesions can cause bleeding or obstruction. \nBecause it is difficult to differentiate a benign leiomyoma from \na malignant leiomyosarcoma, these lesions should be resected. \nRecurrence is common after local resection, but most small \nleiomyomas can be adequately treated with limited resection. \nLesions > 5 cm should be treated with radical resection because \nthe risk of malignancy is high. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1303.)\n 16. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are, by defini -\ntion, malignant.\nA. True\nB. FalseAnswer: B\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).  Gastrointestinal stro -\nmal tumors (GIST) are most common in the proximal GI tract \nbut do occasionally occur in the colorectum (5%\u201310%) and may \nbe mistaken for leiomyomas. GISTs are mesenchymal tumors \nthat arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The vast majority \n(>95%) of GISTs express CD117 (KIT), and as such, are sensitive \nto tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate \nand sunitinib malate. Risk stratification is based on tumor size \nand mitotic activity, and 30% to 50% are malignant. Although \nsmall GISTs may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, \nlarger lesions can cause bleeding, obstruction, or abdominal \npain. Treatment of choice is surgical resection (either local exci -\nsion or radical resection) with microscopically negative margins, \nif possible; however, local recurrence is common. For larger mar -\nginally resectable tumors, TKIs (imatinib) can be used to shrink \nthe tumor. These agents can also be considered for adjuvant ther -\napy after resection and are useful for treating metastatic disease. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1303.)\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   249 30/06/22   11:25 AM"

Perineal rectosigmoidectomy (Altemeier procedure)\nB. Reefing the rectal mucosa (Delorme procedure)\nC. Anal encirclement\nD. Abdominal rectopexyAnswer: D\nBecause rectal prolapse occurs most commonly in elderly \nwomen, the choice of operation depends in part on the \npatient\u2019s overall medical condition. Abdominal rectopexy \n(with or without sigmoid resection) offers the most durable \nrepair, with recurrence occurring in <10% of patients. Peri -\nneal rectosigmoidectomy avoids an abdominal operation and \nmay be preferable in high-risk patients but is associated with \na higher recurrence rate. Reefing the rectal mucosa is effec -\ntive for patients with limited prolapse. Anal encirclement \nprocedures generally have been abandoned (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1306.)\n 19. Which of the following scenarios describes appropriate \nuse of endoscopy in the setting of volvulus?\nA. A 75-year-old man presenting with sigmoid volvulus \nand peritonitis, since he needs emergent detorsion\nB. An 80-year-old woman presenting with cecal \n volvulus, due to the low rates of recurrence of cecal \nvolvulus following colonoscopic detorsion\nC. A 90-year-old woman with sigmoid volvulus and \nmoderate abdominal tenderness, since she is hemo -\ndynamically stableAnswer: C\nUnless there are obvious signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the \ninitial management of sigmoid volvulus is resuscitation fol -\nlowed by endoscopic detorsion. Detorsion is usually most eas -\nily accomplished by using a rigid proctoscope, but a flexible \nsigmoidoscope or colonoscope may also be effective. A rectal \ntube may be inserted to maintain decompression. Although \nthese techniques are successful in reducing sigmoid volvu -\nlus in the majority of patients, the risk of recurrence is high \n(up to 40%). For this reason, an elective sigmoid colectomy \nshould be performed after the patient has been stabilized and \nundergone an adequate bowel preparation.\nClinical evidence of gangrene or perforation mandates \nimmediate surgical exploration without an attempt at endo -\nscopic decompression. Similarly, the presence of necrotic \nmucosa, ulceration, or dark blood noted on endoscopy \nexamination suggests strangulation and is an indication for \noperation. If dead bowel is present at laparotomy, a sigmoid \ncolectomy with end colostomy (Hartmann procedure) may \nbe the safest operation to perform.\nCecal volvulus . Cecal volvulus results from nonfixation \nof the right colon. In the majority of cases, rotation occurs  17. Which of the following statements accurately describes \nthe role of surgical therapy in anal melanoma?\nA. Wide local excision should be attempted first for \nlocalized disease.\nB. Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is the initial \ntreatment of choice due to unacceptably high rates of \nrecurrence with wide local excision.\nC. Surgery has no role in anal melanoma.Answer: A\nMelanoma . Anorectal melanoma is rare, comprising <1% of all \nanorectal malignancies and 1% to 2% of melanomas. Diagnosis \nis often delayed, and symptoms are attributed to hemorrhoidal \ndisease. Despite many advances in the treatment of cutaneous \nmelanoma, prognosis for patients with anorectal disease remains \npoor. Overall 5-year survival is <10%, and many patients pres -\nent with systemic metastasis and/or deeply invasive tumors at \nthe time of diagnosis. A few patients with anorectal melanoma, \nhowever, present with isolated local or locoregional disease that \nis potentially resectable for cure, and both radical resection \n(APR) and wide local excision have been advocated. Recur -\nrence is common and usually occurs systemically regardless of \nthe initial surgical procedure. Local resection with free margins \ndoes not increase the risk of local or regional recurrence, and \nAPR offers no survival advantage over local excision. Because \nof the morbidity associated with APR, wide local excision is \nrecommended for initial treatment of localized anal melanoma. \nIn some patients, wide local excision may not be technically \nfeasible, and APR may be required if the tumor involves a sig -\nnificant portion of the anal sphincter or is circumferential. The \naddition of adjuvant chemotherapy, biochemotherapy, vaccines, \nor radiotherapy may be of benefit in some patients, but efficacy \nremains unproven.

A patient on the trauma wards undergoes abdominal \ncomputed tomography (CT) for lack of return of bowel \nfunction following operative fixation of pelvic fractures \n10 days ago. He has been using high dose opioids for \npain. Imaging is suggestive of Ogilvie syndrome. He is \nhemodynamically stable and without evidence of perito -\nnitis. What is the next best step in management?\nA. Conduct a discussion with the patient and the hospi -\ntal\u2019s pain service to identify alternative medications \nto reduce his opioid use.\nB. Transfer to the ICU to initiate neostigmine.\nC. Consult gastroenterology for colonoscopic \ndecompression.\nD. Proceed to the operating room (OR) for diagnostic \nlaparoscopy.Answer: A\nColonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) is a func -\ntional disorder in which the colon becomes massively dilated \nin the absence of mechanical obstruction. Pseudo- obstruction \nmost commonly occurs in hospitalized patients and is asso -\nciated with the use of narcotics, bed rest, and comorbid dis -\nease. Pseudo-obstruction is thought to result from autonomic \ndysfunction and severe adynamic ileus. The diagnosis is made \nbased on the presence of massive dilatation of the colon (usu -\nally predominantly the right  and transverse  colon) in the \nabsence of a mechanical obstruction. Initial treatment consists \nof cessation of narcotics, anticholinergics, or other medica -\ntions that may contribute to ileus. Strict bowel rest and intra -\nvenous hydration are crucial. Most patients will respond to \nthese measures. In patients who fail to improve, colonoscopic \ndecompression often is effective. However, this procedure is \ntechnically challenging, and great care must be taken to avoid \ncausing perforation. Up to 40% of patients recur. Intravenous \nneostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), administered \nas a single 2 mg dose, also is extremely effective in decompress -\ning the dilated colon and is associated with a low rate of recur -\nrence (20%). However, neostigmine may produce transient but \nprofound bradycardia and may be inappropriate in patients \nwith cardiopulmonary disease. Because the colonic dilatation \nis typically greatest in the proximal colon, placement of a rec -\ntal tube is rarely effective. It is crucial to exclude mechanical \nobstruction (usually with a Gastrografin enema) prior to med -\nical or endoscopic treatment. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1308.)\n 21. In which way do small and large bowel ischemia differ?\nA. Small bowel ischemia is more common overall.\nB. Large bowel ischemia is typically due to major arte -\nrial or venous occlusion, whereas small bowel isch -\nemia is more frequently seen in low flow states.\nC. Large bowel ischemia is managed nonoperatively \nmore frequently than small bowel ischemia.Answer: C\nIntestinal ischemia occurs most commonly in the colon. \nUnlike small bowel ischemia, colonic ischemia rarely is asso -\nciated with major arterial or venous occlusion. Instead, most \ncolonic ischemia appears to result from low flow and/or small \nvessel occlusion. Risk factors include vascular disease, dia -\nbetes mellitus, vasculitis, hypotension, and tobacco use. In \naddition, ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery during \naortic surgery predisposes to colonic ischemia. Occasionally, \nthrombosis or embolism may cause ischemia. Although the \nsplenic flexure is the most common site of ischemic colitis, \nany segment of the colon may be affected. The rectum is rela -\ntively spared because of its rich collateral circulation.around the ileocolic blood vessels and vascular impairment \noccurs early, although 10% to 30% of the cecum folds upon \nitself (cecal bascule). Plain X-rays of the abdomen show a \ncharacteristic kidney-shaped, air-filled structure in the left \nupper quadrant (opposite the site of obstruction), and a \nGastrografin enema confirms obstruction at the level of the \nvolvulus.\nUnlike sigmoid volvulus, cecal volvulus can almost never \nbe detorsed endoscopically. Moreover, because vascular com -\npromise occurs early in the course of cecal volvulus, surgical \nexploration is necessary when the diagnosis is made. Right \nhemicolectomy with a primary ileocolic anastomosis can \nusually be performed safely and prevents recurrence. Simple \ndetorsion or detorsion and cecopexy are associated with a \nhigh rate of recurrence. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1307.)\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   251 30/06/22   11:25 AM"

First-degree: no prolapse, visualized endoscopically \nonly\nB. Second-degree: prolapse into the anal canal only\nC. Third-degree: prolapse through the anus that requires \nmanual reduction\nD. Fourth-degree: a term reserved for prolapsed hemor -\nrhoids that are strangulatedAnswer: C\nInternal hemorrhoids  are located proximal to the dentate line \nand covered by insensate anorectal mucosa. Internal hemor -\nrhoids may prolapse or bleed, but they rarely become painful \nunless they develop thrombosis and necrosis (usually related \nto severe prolapse, incarceration, and/or strangulation). \nInternal hemorrhoids are graded according to the extent of \nprolapse. First-degree hemorrhoids  bulge into the anal canal \nand may prolapse beyond the dentate line on straining. \n Second-degree hemorrhoids  prolapse through the anus but \nreduce spontaneously. Third-degree hemorrhoids  prolapse \nthrough the anal canal and require manual reduction. Fourth-\ndegree hemorrhoids  prolapse but cannot be reduced and are at \nrisk for strangulation.

The patient should get a prescription for opioid \npain medication and can follow up in my office next \nweek to ensure the pain is resolved. \u201d\nB. \u201cThis pain can be seen with urinary retention. The \npatient can undergo straight catheterization in the \nER and is appropriate to discharge after demonstrat -\ning the ability to void independently. \u201d\nC. \u201cThe patient should be admitted for broad-spectrum \nantibiotics, and I will see the patient after my sched -\nuled cases tomorrow. \u201d\nD. \u201cI am concerned about a rare but serious com -\nplication. I will be there to examine the patient \nimmediately. \u201dAnswer: D\nOther complications of rubber band ligation include urinary \nretention, infection , and bleeding . Urinary retention occurs in \napproximately 1% of patients and is more likely if the ligation \nhas inadvertently included a portion of the internal sphincter. \nNecrotizing infection  is an uncommon, but life-threatening  \ncomplication. Severe pain, fever, and urinary retention are \nearly signs of infection and should prompt immediate eval -\nuation of the patient usually with an examination under \nanesthesia. Treatment includes debridement of necrotic tis -\nsue, drainage of associated abscesses, and broad-spectrum \nantibiotics. Bleeding  may occur approximately 7 to 10 days \nafter rubber band ligation, at the time when the ligated ped -\nicle necroses and sloughs. Bleeding is usually self-limited, \nbut persistent hemorrhage may require examination under \nanesthesia and suture ligation of the pedicle. (See Schwartz  \n11th ed., p. 1312.)Treatment of ischemic colitis depends on clinical severity. \nUnlike ischemia of the small bowel, the majority of patients \nwith ischemic colitis can be treated medically. Bowel rest and \nbroad-spectrum antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, and \n80% of patients will recover with this regimen. Hemodynamic \nparameters should be optimized, especially if hypotension and \nlow flow appear to be the inciting cause. Long-term sequelae \ninclude stricture (10%\u201315%) and chronic segmental ischemia \n(15%\u201320%). Colonoscopy should be performed after recov -\nery to evaluate strictures and to rule out other diagnoses \nsuch as inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. Failure to \nimprove after 2 to 3 days of medical management, progres -\nsion of symptoms, and deterioration in clinical condition are \nindications for surgical exploration. In this setting, all necrotic \nbowel should be resected. Primary anastomosis should be \navoided. Occasionally, repeated exploration (a  second-look \noperation ) may be necessary.

Rectovaginal fistulas in the setting of prior pelvic \nradiation can represent cancer recurrence.\nC. Rectovaginal fistulas in Crohn disease often heal \nspontaneously.\nD. Rectovaginal fistulas following obstetric injury typi -\ncally require operative repair.Answer: B\nA rectovaginal fistula is a connection between the vagina and \nthe rectum or anal canal proximal to the dentate line. Rec -\ntovaginal fistulas are classified as low (rectal opening close \nto the dentate line and vaginal opening in the fourchette), \nmiddle  (vaginal opening between the fourchette and cervix), \nor high (vaginal opening near the cervix). Low rectovaginal \nfistulas are commonly caused by obstetric injuries or trauma \nfrom a foreign body. Mid-rectovaginal fistulas may result \nfrom more severe obstetric injury, but they also occur after \nsurgical resection of a mid-rectal neoplasm, radiation injury, \nor extension of an undrained abscess. High rectovaginal fis -\ntulas result from operative or radiation injury. Complicated \ndiverticulitis may cause a colovaginal fistula. Crohn disease \ncan cause rectovaginal fistulas at all levels, as well as colovagi -\nnal and enterovaginal fistulas.\nDiagnosis . Patients describe symptoms varying from the \nsensation of passing flatus from the vagina to the passage of \nsolid stool from the vagina. Most patients experience some \ndegree of fecal incontinence. Contamination may result in \nvaginitis . Large fistulas may be obvious on anoscopic and/or \nvaginal speculum examination, but smaller fistulas may be \ndifficult to locate. Occasionally, a barium enema or vagino -\ngram may identify these fistulas. Endorectal ultrasound may \nalso be useful. With the patient in the prone position, instal -\nlation of methylene blue into the rectum while a tampon is in \nthe vagina may confirm the presence of a small fistula.\nTreatment . The treatment of rectovaginal fistula depends \non the size, location, etiology, and condition of surround -\ning tissues. Because up to 50% of fistulas caused by obstetric \ninjury heal spontaneously, it is prudent to wait 3 to 6 months \nbefore embarking on surgical repair in these patients. If the \nfistula was caused by a cryptoglandular abscess, drainage of \nthe abscess may allow spontaneous closure.\nLow and mid-rectovaginal fistulas are usually best treated \nwith an endorectal advancement flap. The principle of this \nprocedure is based on the advancement of healthy mucosa, \nsubmucosa, and circular muscle over the rectal opening \n(the high-pressure side of the fistula) to promote healing \n( Fig. 29-3). If a sphincter injury is present, an overlapping \nsphincteroplasty should be performed concurrently. Fecal \ndiversion is rarely required. High rectovaginal, colovagi -\nnal, and enterovaginal fistulas are usually best treated via a \ntransabdominal approach. The diseased tissue, which caused \nthe fistula (upper rectum, sigmoid colon, or small bowel), is  24. After drainage of a perianal abscess, for which of the \nfollowing patients would a course of antibiotics be \nprescribed?\nA. Antibiotics are never prescribed as long as source \ncontrol has been obtained.\nB. A 25-year-old man with approximately 2 cm of cir -\ncumferential erythema surrounding the drained \nabscess\nC. A 40-year-old diabetic patient with a fingerstick glu -\ncose value of 310 mg/dL in the emergency room (ER)\nD. A 30-year-old woman with a well-drained abscess \nand no cellulitis, though this is her third episode of \nperianal abscess in the last decadeAnswer: C\nAnorectal abscesses should be treated by drainage as soon as \nthe diagnosis is established. If the diagnosis is in question, \nan examination and drainage under anesthesia are often the \nmost expeditious ways both to confirm the diagnosis and \nto treat the problem. Delayed or inadequate treatment may \noccasionally cause extensive and life-threatening suppura -\ntion with massive tissue necrosis and septicemia. Antibiotics \nare only indicated if there is extensive overlying cellulitis or if \nthe patient is immunocompromised, has diabetes mellitus, or \nhas valvular heart disease. Antibiotics alone are ineffective at \ntreating perianal or perirectal infection. (See Schwartz 11th \ned., p. 1314.)\nBrunicardi_Ch29_p241-258.indd   253 30/06/22   11:25 AM"

CT abdomen/pelvis to locate foreign body\nC. Removal of foreign body in the ER\nD. Proceed to operating room (OR) for laparotomyAnswer: A\nForeign body entrapment in the rectum is not uncommon. \nDepending on the level of entrapment, a foreign body may \ncause damage to the rectum, rectosigmoid, or descending \ncolon. Generalized abdominal pain suggests intraperitoneal \nperforation. Evaluation of the patient includes inspection of \nthe perineum and a careful abdominal examination to detect \nany evidence of perforation. Plain films of the abdomen are \nmandatory to detect free intra-abdominal air.\nForeign bodies lodged low in the rectum may often be \nremoved under conscious sedation with or without a local \nanesthetic block. Objects impacted higher in the rectum \nmay require regional or general anesthesia for removal. Only \nrarely will a laparotomy be required to remove the object, \neither through manual manipulation of the object to expel \nfrom the anus, or via colotomy. After removal of the foreign \nbody, it is crucial to evaluate the rectum and sigmoid colon \nfor injury. Proctoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy should \nbe performed. A hematoma without evidence of perforation \nrequires no surgical treatment. Perforation of the rectum or \nsigmoid colon should be managed as described in the preced -\ning sections. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1323.)\n 27. A patient on the hematology service status post bone \nmarrow transplant develops abdominal cramping, nau -\nsea/vomiting, and diarrhea with specks of bright blood \nin it.

Upon evaluation, \nthe patient is noted to have some distension and mod -\nerate diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritonitis. \nVitals are within normal limits.

The presence of pneumatosis implies a contained \nperforation, so the patient should be taken urgently \nto the operating room (OR) for exploration and \nresection.\nB. Mesenteric ischemia is highest on the differential, and \nthe gastroenterologist on call should be contacted to \nperform a colonoscopy for definitive diagnosis.\nC.

The patient should be prescribed bowel rest and \nbroad-spectrum antibiotics with serial abdominal \nexaminations to evaluate for progression.Answer: D\nNeutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)  is a life-threatening \nproblem with a mortality rate of >50%. This syndrome is \ncharacterized by abdominal pain and distention, fever, diar -\nrhea (often bloody), nausea, and vomiting in a patient with \nfewer than 1000 neutrophils/\u03bcL blood from any cause (bone \n marrow transplantation, solid-organ transplantation, or \n chemotherapy). Its etiology is poorly understood. Histologic \nfeatures can be seen on biopsy or surgical resection and include \na paucity of inflammatory and leukemic infiltrates but with \nmucosal and submucosal edema, villous sloughing,  stromal \nhemorrhage, and patchy-to-complete epithelial necrosis. \nCT scan of the abdomen often shows a dilated cecum with \npericolic stranding. However, a normal-appearing CT scan \ndoes not exclude the diagnosis. Some patients will respond \nto bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral nutri -\ntion, and granulocyte infusion or colony-stimulating factors. \nEvidence of perforation, generalized peritonitis, and dete -\nrioration in clinical condition are indications for operation. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 323\u2013324.)and vagina.

Mucosal ulcerations, crypt abscesses, inflammatory \npseudopolyps, continuous involvement of colon and \nrectumAnswer: A\nUlcerative colitis is a mucosal process in which the colonic \nmucosa and submucosa are infiltrated with inflammatory \ncells. The mucosa may be atrophic, and crypt abscesses are \ncommon. Endoscopically, the mucosa is frequently friable \nand may possess multiple inflammatory pseudopolyps. In \nlong-standing ulcerative colitis, the colon may be foreshort -\nened and the mucosa replaced by scar. A key feature of ulcer -\native colitis is the continuous involvement of the rectum and \ncolon; rectal sparing or skip lesions suggest a diagnosis of \nCrohn disease. Crohn disease is a transmural inflammatory \nprocess that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract \nfrom mouth to anus. Mucosal ulcerations, an inflammatory \ncell infiltrate, and noncaseating granulomas are characteristic \npathologic findings. Chronic inflammation may ultimately \nresult in fibrosis, strictures, and fistulas in either the colon or \nsmall intestine. The endoscopic appearance of Crohn colitis is \ncharacterized by deep serpiginous ulcers and a \u201ccobblestone\u201d \nappearance.

He is mildly \ntachycardic, afebrile, and normotensive with local RLQ \ntenderness but no peritonitis. What is the optimal \napproach to this patient?\nA. Immediate laparotomy\nB. Laparoscopic exploration and abscess drainage\nC. Percutaneous drainage, intravenous (IV) fluids, \nbowel rest, and broad spectrum antibiotics\nD. IV fluids, bowel rest, and broad spectrum antibioticsAnswer: C\nPerforated appendicitis can be managed either operatively or \nnonoperatively. Immediate surgery is necessary in patients \nthat appear septic, but this is usually associated with higher \ncomplications, including abscesses and enterocutaneous \n fistulae due to dense adhesions and inflammation. The man -\nagement of long-duration, complicated appendicitis is often \nstaged. Patients are resuscitated and treated with IV antibiot -\nics. Patients with long-standing perforation are better treated \nwith adequate percutaneous image-guided drainage. This \nstrategy is successful in 79% of patients who achieve complete \nresolution, which occurs more often in lower-grade abscesses, \ntrans-gluteal drainage, and with CT- (vs. ultrasound-) guided \ndrainage. Operative intervention is performed in patients \nwho fail conservative management and in patients with free \nintra-peritoneal perforation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1335.) 1.

Increased risk of an intra-abdominal abscess\nB. Increased risk of surgical-site infection\nC. Decreased operative time\nD. Increased risk of perforation\nE. No difference in perforation rates, surgical-site \n infection, abscess, conversion rate, or operative timeAnswer: E\nEmergent surgery is often performed in patients with appen -\ndicitis, but studies have evaluated the performance of urgent \nsurgery (waiting < 12 hours) in a semi-elective setting after \nadministering antibiotics upon admission. The studies did \nnot reveal any significant difference in outcomes, except for a \nslightly longer hospital stay in those undergoing urgent sur -\ngery. Currently, delaying surgery <12 hours is acceptable in \npatients with short duration of symptoms (<48 hours) and in \nnonperforated, non-gangrenous appendicitis.

Laboratory tests reveal a leukocytosis \nof 13,000 and he is tender in the right lower quadrant \n(RLQ) on physical examination. He is taken to the oper -\nating room for laparoscopic appendectomy. Removal of \nthe appendix has been associated with a protective effect \nto which of the following?\nA. Crohn colitis\nB. Ulcerative colitis\nC. Clostridium difficile\nD. CarcinoidAnswer: B\nPreviously considered a vestigial organ, the appendix is now \nlinked to the development and preservation of gut-associated \nlymphoid tissue (GALT) and to the maintenance of intestinal \nflora. It has been suggested that appendectomy is associated \nwith increased C. difficile  infections and increased subsequent \ncancer (colon, esophageal) as a result of microbial alteration, \nalthough this is currently unproven. The protective effect of \nan early appendectomy against development of ulcerative \ncolitis has been proposed to be mechanistically linked to the \nrelease of dimeric forms of IgA from plasma B cells and the \nTh2 response mediated by IL-13\u2013producing natural killer T \ncells.

On examination, he has tenderness localized to \nMcBurney\u2019s point. His laboratory data show leukocyto -\nsis of 13,000/mm3. On surgical exploration, you note a \nnormal-appearing appendix and cecum. The terminal \nileum appeared inflamed and edematous, concerning for \nCrohn disease without stigmata of obstruction. What is \nthe most appropriate further course of action?\nA. Abort the planned appendectomy.\nB. Resect the inflamed terminal ileum.\nC. Bypass the inflamed ileum by performing \nileo-colostomy.\nD. Perform an appendectomy if the base is uninflamed.Answer: D\nUpon performing a laparoscopy or laparotomy for suspected \nappendicitis, if one finds no evidence of appendicitis, a thor -\nough exploration of the peritoneum must be performed to \nrule out contributing pathology. A normal appendix is often \nremoved to reduce future diagnostic dilemma. Management \nof incidentally found common conditions is summarized in \nTable 30-1. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1337 and Table 30-3.) 4. While reviewing pathology of a recent laparoscopic \nappendectomy, you note that in addition to acute appen -\ndicitis, the patient had a 1.5-cm carcinoid tumor located \nat the base of the appendix with mesenteric invasion. \nThe patient is otherwise healthy and recovering well \nfrom surgery. What would you recommend?\nA. No additional therapy is necessary.\nB. Right hemicolectomy.\nC. Radical appendectomy.\nD. Adjuvant chemotherapy.Answer: B\nAppendiceal carcinoid tumors are submucosal rubbery \nmasses that are detected incidentally on the appendix. \n Carcinoid tumors of the appendix are relatively indolent but \ncan develop nodal or hepatic metastases. Infrequently, these \ncan be associated with carcinoid syndrome if there are hepatic \nmetastases (2.9%). Upon incidental findings of a suspected \ncarcinoid, the surgeon must evaluate the nodal basin along \nthe ileocolic pedicle and also examine the liver for any signs \nof metastases. For lesions that are <1 cm (95% of all lesions), \na  negative margin appendectomy is adequate. For tumors \n\u22652 cm, a right hemicolectomy is recommended. For lesions \n1 to 2 cm in size, there is no consensus on a completion col -\nectomy. A right colectomy is often performed for mesenteric \ninvasion, enlarged nodes, or positive or unclear margins. \nMeasurement of serum chromogranin A is recommended. \nA radical appendectomy is not a described operation and \nadjuvant chemotherapy could be considered but only after \n definitive surgical care.

Laparoscopically excise the abnormal appendix with -\nout capsular disruption by dividing the appendix at \nthe normal stump and retrieve the specimen in a bag\nD. Limited ileocecectomyAnswer: C\nLow-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMN) are \nnonmalignant neoplasms of the appendix that present in a \nthird of cases with appendicitis. It is important to carefully \nassess for the presence of ascites, peritoneal disease, and scal -\nloping of the liver surface on imaging upon initial evaluation. \nA reliable diagnosis cannot be established using imaging \nalone, and it is recommended that surgical excision without \ncapsular disruption is undertaken. The importance of care -\nful handling of a LAMN and the avoidance of rupture cannot \nbe overemphasized because the intraperitoneal spread of epi -\nthelial cells with subsequent development of pseudomyxoma \nperitonei is a dreaded consequence. In cases where a homo -\ngeneous cyst without nodularity or signs of dissemination is \nencountered, laparoscopic excision is acceptable, provided \nBrunicardi_Ch30_p259-262.indd   260 30/06/22   11:25 AM"

Perform appendectomy using a stapling device, with \nstaple line through the healthy cecumAnswer: D\nIn the case of a nonviable appendix base, a staple line through \nthe cecum that avoids the ileocecal valve might be sufficient, \nunless significant inflammation is present. The appendix \nis retrieved through the midline port in a  specimen bag, \nespecially if an appendiceal lesion is suspected. If a peri- \nappendiceal phlegmon is encountered or if the operation is \nbeing performed for perforated appendicitis, careful sweeping \nof the bowel with a blunt dissector can release the appendix.

Postoperative antibiotics are not needed.Answer: B\nIn patients with perforated appendicitis undergoing operative \nintervention, preoperative antibiotics are necessary to cover \ngram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. Monotherapy with \npiperacillin/tazobactam or combination of cephalosporin \nwith metronidazole are reasonable choices. The duration of \npostoperative antibiotics is generally <4 days once complete \nsource control has been achieved (STOP-IT trial). Patients \nwith incomplete drainage, persistent catheters, complica -\ntions from surgery, and uncertain resolution of inflammation \nmight need a longer duration of antibiotics. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1336.)that a stapler is fired across the base of the cecum to avoid a \npositive margin. The specimen should be placed in a plastic \nbag and carefully removed without disruption. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1339.)\n 9.

She is concerned about an \nappendectomy and is afraid of surgery. She asks for alter -\nnate treatment options. What are appropriate alternate \noptions for this otherwise healthy patient?\nA. Counsel that surgery is the only option.\nB. Prescribe oral fluoroquinolones with analgesics and \nask her to follow up after a week.\nC. Admit and start intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\nD. Reassure her that surgery is not emergent, and she \ncan reconsider it after a few weeks.Answer: C\nThe preferred approach to manage patients with uncompli -\ncated appendicitis is an appendectomy. Several recent ran -\ndomized trials and cohort studies have examined the role \nof nonoperative management of adult patients with appen -\ndicitis. A majority of the patients in the nonoperative arm \nreceived IV antibiotics for a short course followed by a course \nof a fluoroquinolone and metronidazole, or oral amoxicil -\nlin/clavulanic acid. Currently, conservative management can \nbe offered to informed patients using techniques of shared \ndecision-making, but it is not the standard modality of man -\nagement of appendicitis, except in patients with significant \nphobia of surgery (Fig. 30-2).

An ultrasound is preferred to computed tomography \n(CT) scan due to its higher sensitivity and reduced \nrisk of radiation to patients.\nB.

Graded compression ultrasound suggestive of eas -\nily compressible appendix < 5 mm in diameter is \npathognomonic of appendicitis.Answer: C\nImaging is often utilized to confirm a diagnosis of appendi -\ncitis because a negative operation rate is acceptable in <10% \nof male patients and <20% of female patients. A contrast-\nenhanced CT scan has a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% confidence \ninterval [CI] 0.95\u20130.97) and specificity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93\u2013\n0.97) in diagnosing acute appendicitis. Features on a CT scan \nthat suggest appendicitis include enlarged lumen and double \nwall thickness (>6 mm), wall thickening (>2 mm), periap -\npendiceal fat stranding, appendiceal wall thickening, and/or \nan appendicolith. While there remains a concern of ionizing \nradiation exposure with a CT scan, typical low-dose CT scans \nresult in exposure of 2 to 4 mSv, which is not significantly \nhigher than background radiation (3.1 mSv).

In your patient taking 5 mg of warfarin daily for a pros -\nthetic mitral valve, how might metronidazole treatment \nfor Clostridium difficile  affect their international normal -\nized ratio (INR)?\nA. Increase the INR due to cytochrome P-450 isoform \ninhibition.\nB. Increase the INR due to induction of P-450 isoform.\nC. No change, metronidazole does not affect hepatic \nmetabolism of P-450 isoforms.\nD. Reduction of INR due to alterations in intestinal \nmicroflora.Answer: A\nMany factors can affect drug metabolism in the liver. When \nthe rate of metabolism of a drug is increased (ie, enzyme \ninduction), the duration of the drug action will decrease. \nHowever, when the metabolism of a drug is decreased (ie, \nenzyme inhibition), then the drug will circulate for a longer \nperiod of time, potentially increasing the effect of the medica -\ntion. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and therefore reduces \nhepatic synthesis of coagulation factors. As metronidazole \ninhibits the metabolism of warfarin, the anti-coagulation \neffects are increased and the INR may rise. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1352.)\n 8. Which of the following compounds is not synthesized \npredominantly by the liver?\nA. Albumin\nB. Factor VIII\nC. Factor VII\nD. Factor IIAnswer: B\nThe liver is the largest gland in the body, and responsible for \nsynthesis of the majority of plasma proteins. The liver pro -\nduces approximately 10 g of albumin per day, and albumin \nmeasurement can therefore be used as a surrogate for liver \nsynthetic function. This must be interpreted with caution, as \nalbumin levels can be influenced by a host of factors unrelated \nto hepatic function, and albumin\u2019s long half-life (15\u201320 days) \nmakes it a poor marker for acute hepatic dysfunction. Most \nclotting factors are synthesized predominantly in the liver, \nexcept for factor VIII. Due to this fact the prothrombin time \n(PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) may also be \nused as markers of hepatic synthetic function. However, \nthese too should be interpreted with caution as other condi -\ntions, including vitamin K deficiency and warfarin use, may \n prolong a patient\u2019s PT/INR.

Concurrent obstructive primary sclerosing \ncholangitis\nC. Terminal ileum resections resulting in bile acid and \nsalts malabsorption\nD. Intestinal bacterial depletion resulting in inadequate \nbilirubin conjugationAnswer: C\nBile salts are sodium and potassium salts of bile acids derived \nfrom cholesterol by hepatocytes. After synthesis, the primary \nbile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid are conjugated \nto either taurine or glycine and then secreted into the  biliary \nsystem. Approximately 90%\u201395% of these primary bile salts \nand acids are absorbed by active transport at the terminal \nileum, a region commonly affected by Crohn disease, while \nthe remainder enter the colon and are converted to second -\nary bile acids (deoxycholic and lithocolic acids) and their \n associated salts by resident bacteria. Bile acids and salts \n reabsorbed in the terminal ileum are reabsorbed through the \nportal circulation, while those lost in the stool are replaced by \nhepatic  synthesis. The continuous process of secretion of bile \nsalts in the bile, their passage through the intestine, and their \nsubsequent return to the liver is termed the  enterohepatic \n circulation.

In a patient without prior liver disease, what is the most \ncommon cause of hepatic encephalopathy occurring \nwithin 26 weeks of severe liver injury?\nA. Alcohol in developing nations.\nB. Causes are unknown.\nC. Hepatitis B, A, and E in the United States.\nD. Drug-/toxin-induced (including acetaminophen) in \nthe United States.Answer: D\nDifferences in etiology, management, and patient outcomes \nhave been described for various regions of the globe. In the \nEast and developing portions of the world, the most com -\nmon causes of acute liver failure (ALF) are viral infections, \nprimarily hepatitis B, A, and E. In these areas, there are a rela -\ntively small number of drug-induced cases. In contrast, 65% \nof cases of ALF in the West are thought to be due to drugs \nand toxins, with acetaminophen (paracetamol) being the \nmost common etiologic agent in the United States,  Australia, \nUnited Kingdom, and most of Europe. In France and Spain, \nwhere acetaminophen sales are restricted, the rate of acet -\naminophen-induced ALF is quite low. Acetaminophen-\ninduced ALF is also uncommon in South America. The US \nAcute Liver Failure Study Group identified several other \ncauses of ALF, including autoimmune hepatitis, hypoperfu -\nsion of the liver (in cardiomyopathy or cardiogenic shock), \npregnancy-related conditions, and Wilson disease. Even with \nexhaustive efforts to identify a cause, approximately 20% of all \ncases of ALF remain indeterminate in origin. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1361 .)tumors, radiologists are able to selectively enhance the liver \nparenchyma or tumor during the portal venous or arterial \nphases of the scan, respectively. Limitations of ultrasound \ninclude incomplete imaging of the liver, most often at the \ndome or beneath ribs on the surface, and incomplete visual -\nization of lesion boundaries. Moreover, obesity and overlying \nbowel gas also can interfere with image quality. Thus, ultraso -\nnographically detected masses usually require further evalu -\nation by other imaging modalities due to the lower sensitivity \nand specificity of ultrasound compared with CT and MRI. \nMRI offers advantages over CT in allowing higher soft tissue \ncontrast and superior depiction of fluid-containing structures \nwhile eliminating the need for ionizing radiation. Develop -\nment of specialized liver-specific contrast agents, including \nferumoxide and gadoxetate, has led to the development of \nMRI that allows characterization of both hepatic structure \nand function. While positron emission tomography/com -\nputed tomography (PET/CT) is used frequently in the stag -\ning and follow-up of patients with metastatic liver lesions, its \nrole in the diagnosis and management of primary liver lesions \nis uncertain. The reported sensitivity of fluorodeoxyglucose \n(FDG)-PET/CT for the detection of hepatocellular carci -\nnoma is only 50%\u201365%. While this has been improved with \ndevelopment of dual-tracer PET/CT, the clinical benefits of \nthis modality have yet to be clearly defined. Despite advances \nin other imaging modalities, intraoperative liver ultrasound \nremains the gold standard. This technique has the ability to \nidentify 20%\u201330% more lesions than preoperative imaging, \nand it is estimated that approximately 50% of planned sur -\ngical resections are influenced by information gleaned from \nintraoperative ultrasound.

Other etiologies \ninclude alcohol abuse, nonalcoholic steatohepaitis, and auto -\nimmune diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary scle -\nrosing cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis). Hereditary \nhemochromatosis is the most common metabolic cause of \ncirrhosis, and should be suspected if a patient presents with \nskin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, pseudogout, car -\ndiomyopathy, or a family history of cirrhosis. Elevated plasma \nferritin and increased iron saturation levels suggest the pres -\nence of iron overload, but these findings also can be seen \nin other diseases of the liver. Confirmatory testing can be \nachieved by means of genetic testing, liver biopsy, or by assess -\ning the response to phlebotomy.

Approximately 30% of patients with com -\npensated cirrhosis and 60% of patients with decompensated \ncirrhosis have esophageal varices. One-third of all patients \nwith varices will experience variceal bleeding. Each episode \nof bleeding is associated with a 20% to 30% risk of mortality. \nIf left untreated, 70% of patients who survive the initial bleed \nwill experience recurrent variceal hemorrhage within 2 years \nof the index hemorrhage.

Trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting \n(TIPS) followed by variceal bandingAnswer: C\nPatients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be admitted \nto an ICU for resuscitation and management. Blood resusci -\ntation should be performed carefully to reach a hemoglobin \nlevel of approximately 8 g/dL. Overzealous replacement of \nblood products and administration of saline can lead to both \nrebleeding and increased mortality. Administration of fresh \nfrozen plasma and platelets can be considered in patients with \nsevere coagulopathy. Use of recombinant factor VIIa has not \nbeen shown to be more beneficial than standard therapy and \ntherefore is not recommended at this time.\nVasoactive medications decrease blood flow to the gastro -\nesophageal varices and can be initiated as soon as the diagno -\nsis of variceal bleeding is made. Although vasopressin is the \nmost potent available vasoconstrictor, its use is limited by its \nsystemic vasoconstrictive effects that can produce hyperten -\nsion, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, ischemic abdominal \npain, and limb gangrene. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, \nhas the advantage that it can be administered for 5 days or \nlonger, and it is currently the preferred pharmacologic agent \nfor initial management of acute variceal bleeding. In addi -\ntion to pharmacologic therapy, endoscopy with variceal band \nligation should be carried out as soon as possible. This com -\nbination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy has been \nshown both to improve the initial control of bleeding and to \nincrease the 5-day hemostasis rate. TIPS can be performed \nin 95% of patients by an experienced interventional radiolo -\ngist, controls variceal bleeding in >90% of cases refractory to \nmedical treatment, and should not affect subsequent hepatic \ntransplantation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p 1367.)Doppler ultrasound allows identification of vascular occlusion \nand the direction of portal venous flow. Computed tomogra -\nphy (CT) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are \nuseful for evaluating portal venous patency and anatomy. \nThe most accurate method for measuring portal hyperten -\nsion is hepatic venography. This procedure introduces a bal -\nloon catheter directly into the hepatic vein where free hepatic \nvenous pressure (FHVP) is measured. The hepatic vein is then \noccluded by inflation of the balloon allowing measurement of \nthe wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP). The hepatic \nvenous pressure gradient (HVPG) may then be calculated by \nsubtracting the FHVP from the WHVP (HVPG = WHVP \u2212 \nFHVP). Clinically significant portal hypertension is defined \nas HVPG > 10 mm Hg. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1365 .)\nBrunicardi_Ch31_p263-278.indd   271 04/07/22   2:42 PM"

Intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and percutane -\nous drainageAnswer: D\nPyogenic liver abscesses are the most common liver abscesses \nseen in the United States. Patients commonly present with \nright upper quadrant pain and fever. Jaundice occurs in up to \none-third of affected patients. They may be single or multiple \nand are more frequently found in the right lobe of the liver. \nThe abscess cavities are variable in size and, when multiple, \nmay coalesce to give a honeycomb appearance. Approximately \n40% of abscesses are monomicrobial, an additional 40% are \npolymicrobial, and 20% are culture-negative. The most com -\nmon infecting agents are gram-negative bacteria. Escherichia \ncoli is found in two-thirds of cases, and other common organ -\nisms include Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella,  and Proteus \nvulgaris . Anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides fragilis  also \nare seen frequently. In patients with endocarditis and infected \nindwelling catheters, Staphylococcus  and Streptococcus  species \nare more commonly found. Ultrasound examination of the \nliver reveals pyogenic abscesses as round or oval hypoechoic \nlesions with well-defined borders and a variable number of \ninternal echoes.

TIPS functions by creating an intrahe -\npatic shunt between the portal and systemic circulation which \ncauses a reduction in the portal pressure and ultimately in the \nblood flow through varices. It is accomplished by endovascu -\nlar access through the jugular vein to a hepatic vein radical \nand subsequent creation of a needle tract that connects it to a \nbranch of the portal vein. After dilation of the tract, a metallic \nstent is deployed to hold the new portosystemic connection \nopen. Because this shunt reduces first pass metabolism of the \nliver, the most common complication of TIPS is encephalopa -\nthy which occurs in 25%\u201330% of patients. Other complica -\ntions such as hepatic ischemia, infection, renal failure and \nhemorrhage may occur, but are rare. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 1367.) 17. Upon return from New Zealand, a 33-year-old woman \npresents with dull right upper quadrant pain and fevers \ndiagnosed by the presence of echinococcal antigens. \nWhat does the computed tomography (CT) imaging \ndemonstrate.\nA. Multiple, well circumscribed lesions with homog -\nenous arterial enhancement and central scar\nB. Well-defined low-density round lesions that have \nenhancement of the wall, somewhat ragged in \nappearance with a peripheral zone of edema in the \nleft lobe\nC. Anteroinferior hypodense lesion with a distinct wall \nand ring-like calcifications in the right lobe\nD. Asymmetrical nodular peripheral enhancement that \nis isodense with large vessels and exhibit progressive \ncentripetal enhancement fill-in over time in the right \nlobeAnswer: C\nHydatid disease is most common in sheep-raising areas, \nwhere dogs have access to infected offal. These include South \nAustralia, New Zealand, Africa, Greece, Spain, and the Mid -\ndle East. Hydatid cysts commonly involve the right lobe of \nthe liver, usually the anterior-inferior or posterior-inferior \nsegments. Occasionally, the affected patient presents with \nsymptoms such as dull right upper quadrant pain or abdomi -\nnal distention.\nThe diagnosis of hydatid disease is based on the findings of \nan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for echino -\ncoccal antigens, and results are positive in approximately 85% \nof infected patients. Ultrasonography and CT scanning of the \nabdomen are both quite sensitive for detecting hydatid cysts. \nThe appearance of the cysts on images depends on the stage \nof cyst development. Typically, hydatid cysts are well-defined \nhypodense lesions with a distinct wall. Ring-like calcifica -\ntions of the pericysts are present in 20% to 30% of cases. As \nhealing occurs, the entire cyst calcifies densely, and a lesion \nwith this appearance is usually dead or inactive. Daughter \ncysts generally occur in a peripheral location within the main \ncyst and are typically slightly hypodense compared with the \nmother cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdo -\nmen may be useful to evaluate the pericyst, cyst matrix, and \ndaughter cyst characteristics.

Bile duct hamartoma.Answer : B\nWhile hemangiomas are the most common solid benign \nmasses found in the liver, the simple hepatic cyst is still the \nmost common overall. Simple cysts have a prevalence of \napproximately 2.8%\u20133.6%, and are more common in women \nby a ratio of 4:1. Cysts are generally found incidentally dur -\ning abdominal imaging, and small, asymptomatic cysts may \nbe managed conservatively.

These \npatients may be treated with percutaneous cyst aspiration \nand sclerotherapy which is effective in approximately 90% \nof patients. For those that fail percutaneous treatment, or \nwhere percutaneous treatment is not available, surgical cyst \nfenestration may be considered.

It was originally developed as a tool to predict mortal -\nity after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) \nbut has been validated and used as the sole method of liver \ntransplant allocation in the United States since 2002.

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for \npatients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and \ncholangiocarcinoma limited to the common bile \nduct.\nB. Cholangiocarcinoma is very radiosensitive, there -\nfore external-beam radiation and intravenous \n5- fluorouracil constitute destination therapy with \n60% 5-year survival.\nC. 5-year survival rate following the Mayo Clinic proto -\ncol and transplantation is 70%.\nD. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are not \ncandidates for the Mayo Clinic protocol.Answer: C\nCholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, is the second most \ncommon primary malignancy of the liver. Cholangiocarci -\nnoma is an adenocarcinoma of the bile ducts; it forms in the \nbiliary epithelial cells and can be subclassified into peripheral \n(intrahepatic) bile duct cancer and central (extrahepatic) bile \nduct cancer. Extrahepatic bile duct cancer can be located dis -\ntally or proximally. When proximal, it is referred to as a hilar \ncholangiocarcinoma ( Klatskin\u2019s  tumor).\nIn the absence of associated primary sclerosing cholan -\ngitis (PSC), surgical resection is the treatment of choice for \nhilar cholangiocarcinoma. However, approximately 10% of \npatients with cholangiocarcinoma have PSC. Furthermore, \ncholangiocarcinoma in the setting of PSC is frequently mul -\nticentric and often is associated with underlying liver disease, \nwith eventual cirrhosis and portal hypertension. As a result, \nexperience has shown that resection of cholangiocarcinoma \nin patients with PSC yields dismal results.\nThe pretransplant Mayo protocol consists of external-\nbeam radiation therapy plus a protracted course of intrave -\nnous 5-fluorouracil followed by iridium-192 brachytherapy. \nPatients then undergo an abdominal exploration with stag -\ning. If findings are negative, patients are given capecitabine \nfor 2 of every 3 weeks until transplantation. Even after restag -\ning with CT/MRI and endoscopic ultrasonography, approxi -\nmately 15% to 20% of patients will have positive findings for \ntumor on abdominal exploration. The 5-year survival rate for \nthose undergoing transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma at \nthe Mayo Clinic is approximately 70% and compares favor -\nably with the rate for resection. Current eligibility criteria for \nthis Mayo Clinic protocol include unresectable hilar cholan -\ngiocarcinoma or hilar cholangiocarcinoma with PSC. The \ntumor must have a radial dimension of \u22643 cm with no intra -\nhepatic or extrahepatic metastases, and the patient must not \nhave undergone prior radiation therapy or transperitoneal \nbiopsy. Many centers have adopted similar protocols with \ncomparable results. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1377.) 23.

Less than 1%\nB. 1%\u20132%\nC. 2%\u20136%\nD. 6%\u201310%Answer: C\nHCC is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide, and \nits risk factors include viral hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, \nhemochromatosis, and NASH. Cirrhosis is present in 70% to \n90% of patients who develop HCC, and the annual conver -\nsion rate from cirrhosis is 2% to 6%. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 1376.)\n 25. A patient undergoes routine cholecystectomy and is \nincidentally found to have gallbladder carcinoma with -\nout invasion into the muscular layer. Further treatment \nshould include:\nA. No further treatment.\nB. External beam radiation with systemic chemotherapy.\nC. Reoperation with a segment IVb/V resection and \nhilar lymphadenectomy.\nD. Reoperation with formal lobectomy and bile duct \nresection.Answer: A\nGallbladder cancer is a rare and aggressive form of biliary \nmalignancy. In approximately one-third of cases it is diag -\nnosed incidentally following routine cholecystectomy. Treat -\nment for these patients is guided by T stage of the tumor. In \nthose patients with T1a tumors, as in this question, no further \ntreatment is necessary. If the tumor invades into the muscular \nlayer (T1b), reoperation with central liver resection and hilar \nlymphadenectomy is recommended. The role for more radi -\ncal resections is unclear.

Secertin\nE. GhrelinAnswer: B\nThe sphincter of Oddi is a complex structure that is function -\nally independent from the duodenal musculature and creates \na high-pressure zone between the bile duct and the duode -\nnum. The sphincter of Oddi is about 4 to 6 mm in length \nand has a basal resting pressure of about 13 mm Hg above \nthe duodenal pressure. On manometry, the sphincter shows \nphasic contractions with a frequency of about four per min -\nute and an amplitude of 12 to 140 mm Hg. The spontaneous \nmotility of the sphincter of Oddi is regulated by the intersti -\ntial cells of Cajal through intrinsic and extrinsic inputs from \nhormones and neurons acting on the smooth muscle cells. \nRelaxation occurs with a rise in CCK, leading to diminished \namplitude of phasic contractions and reduced basal pressure, \nallowing increased flow of bile into the duodenum. During \nfasting, the sphincter of Oddi activity is coordinated with the \nperiodic partial gallbladder emptying and an increase in bile \nflow that occurs during phase II of the migrating myoelectric \nmotor complexes.

A primary infectious process with secondary \ninflammation.\nB. A sterile primary inflammatory process.\nC. A primary inflammatory process with occasional \nbacterial contamination.\nD. A primary autoimmune process.Answer: C\nObstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone is the initiating \nevent that leads to gallbladder distention, inflammation, and \nedema of the gallbladder wall. Why inflammation develops \nonly occasionally with cystic duct obstruction is unknown. It \nis probably related to the duration of obstruction of the cystic \nduct. Initially, acute cholecystitis is an inflammatory process, \nprobably mediated by the mucosal toxin lysolecithin, a prod -\nuct of lecithin, as well as bile salts and platelet-activating factor. \nIncrease in prostaglandin synthesis amplifies the inflammatory \nresponse. Secondary bacterial contamination is documented \nin 15% to 30% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for \nacute uncomplicated cholecystitis. In acute cholecystitis, the \ngallbladder wall becomes grossly thickened and reddish with \nsubserosal hemorrhages.

Several studies have examined the likelihood of \ndeveloping biliary colic or developing significant complica -\ntions of gallstone disease. Approximately 3% of asymptomatic \nindividuals become symptomatic per year (ie, develop bili -\nary colic). Once symptomatic, patients tend to have recurring \nbouts of biliary colic. Complicated gallstone disease develops \nin 3% to 5% of symptomatic patients per year. Over a 20-year \nperiod, about two-thirds of asymptomatic patients with gall -\nstones remain symptom-free.

Systemic immunosuppression with corticosteroids \nand calcineurin inhibitors.\nB. Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (infliximab).\nC. Consideration for transplantation.\nD. Ursodeoxycholic acid.\nE. Excision of the extrahepatic biliary tree (Kasai \nprocedure).Answer: C\nSclerosing cholangitis (primary or secondary) is an uncom -\nmon disease characterized by inflammatory strictures involv -\ning the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. It is a \nprogressive disease which can lead to biliary cirrhosis. Medi -\ncal therapy has long been attempted with immunosuppres -\nsants, antibiotics, steroids, and ursodeoxycholic acid, and has \nbeen disappointing. Surgical management with resection of \nthe extrahepatic biliary tree and hepaticojejunostomy has \nproduced reasonable results in patients with extrahepatic \nand bifurcation strictures, but without cirrhosis or significant \nhepatic fibrosis. In patients with sclerosing cholangitis and \nadvanced liver disease, liver transplantation is the only option. \nIt offers excellent results, with overall 5-year survival as high \nas 85%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis recurs in 10% to 20% \nof patients and may require retransplantation. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1417.)The mucosa may show hyperemia and patchy necrosis. In \nsevere cases, about 5% to 10%, the inflammatory process pro -\ngresses and leads to ischemia and necrosis of the gallblad -\nder wall. More frequently, the gallstone is dislodged and the \ninflammation resolves. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1405.)\n 7. The gallbladder lymphatics drain into which of the \n following liver segments?\nA.

The gallbladder veins \ndrain directly into the adjacent liver, usually segments IV and \nV , where tumor invasion is common.

Percutaneous cholangiography.\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.\nC. Ultrasound.\nD. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography \n(MRCP).\nE. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan.Answer: C\nThe initial tests are usually ultrasound or computed tomog -\nraphy (CT) scan. A perihilar tumor causes dilatation of the \nintrahepatic biliary tree, but normal or collapsed gallbladder \nand extrahepatic bile ducts distal to the tumor. Distal bile \nduct cancer leads to dilatation of the extra- and intrahepatic \nbile ducts as well as the gallbladder. Ultrasound can establish \nthe level of obstruction and rule out the presence of bile duct \nstones as the cause of the obstructive jaundice. It is usually dif -\nficult to visualize the tumor itself on ultrasound or on a stan -\ndard CT scan. Either ultrasound or spiral CT can be used to \ndetermine portal vein patency. The biliary anatomy is defined \nby cholangiography . Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) defines \nthe proximal extent of the tumor, which is the most important \nfactor in determining resectability.

For the evaluation \nof vascular involvement, celiac angiography may be necessary. \nWith the newer types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a \nsingle noninvasive test has the potential of evaluating the bili -\nary anatomy, lymph nodes, and vascular involvement, as well \nas the tumor growth itself. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1423.)\n 10. Patients with a history of choledochal cysts are at \nincreased risk of developing biliary cancer:\nA. In the gallbladder alone.\nB. Predominantly intra-hepatic portions of the biliary \ntree.\nC. In the distal common bile duct.\nD. At the site of the previous cyst.\nE. Throughout the biliary tree.Answer: E\nPatients with choledochal cysts have an increased risk of \ndeveloping cancer anywhere in the biliary tree, but the inci -\ndence is highest in the gallbladder. Sclerosing cholangitis, \nanomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, and exposure \nto carcinogens (azotoluene, nitrosamines) also are associ -\nated with cancer of the gallbladder. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 1417.) 8. Adequate treatment for a gallbladder lesion involving the \nlamina propria of the gallbladder includes:\nA. Cholecystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\nB. Neoadjuvant chemo-XRT followed by surgical \nresection.\nC. Segemental liver resection and lymphadenectomy \nalone.\nD. Cholecystectomy alone.\nE. Extended right hepatectomy.Answer: D\nTumors limited to the muscular layer of the gallbladder (T1) \nare usually identified incidentally, after cholecystectomy for \ngallstone disease. There is near universal agreement that \nsimple cholecystectomy is an adequate treatment for T1 \nlesions and results in a near 100% overall 5-year survival rate. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1422.)\n 11. What is the best initial management for an intraopera -\ntively identified minor lateral injury to the common bile \nduct?\nA. Placement of a T-tube through the site of injury in \nthe duct\nB.

Resection of the bile duct and a roux-en-Y hepatico-\njejunostomy reconstructionAnswer: A\nLateral injury to the common bile duct or the common \nhepatic duct, recognized at the time of surgery, is best man -\naged with a T-tube placement. If the injury is a small incision \nin the duct, the T-tube may be placed through it as if it were \na formal  choledochotomy. In more extensive lateral injuries, \nthe T-tube should be placed through a separate choledochot -\nomy and the injury closed over the T-tube end to minimize \nthe risk of  subsequent stricture formation.

Mucosa, submucosa, muscularis mucosa, muscularis, \nadventitia, serosa.\nD. Mucosa, muscularis mucosa, muscularis, adventitia, \nserosa.Answer: A\nThe gallbladder differs histologically from the rest of the gas -\ntrointestinal (GI) tract in that it lacks a muscularis mucosa \nand submucosa. The muscular layer has circular, longitu -\ndinal, and oblique fibers, but without well-defined layers. \nThe adventitia contains connective tissue, nerves, vessels, \nlymphatics, and adipocytes. The gallbladder is covered by \nserosa except where the gallbladder is embedded in the liver.  \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1393.)\n 15. The most commonly encountered arterial anomaly seen \nrelated to the gallbladder is:\nA. Replaced cystic artery.\nB. Duplicated cystic artery.\nC. Accessory right hepatic artery.\nD. Replaced right hepatic artery.Answer: D\nAnomalies of the hepatic artery and the cystic artery are quite \ncommon, occurring in as many as 50% of cases. While the \nright hepatic artery usually originates from the proper hepatic \nbranch of the celiac trunk, up to 20% of patients will have a \nreplaced right hepatic artery coming off the superior mesen -\nteric artery. In about 5% of cases, there are two right hepatic \narteries, one from the proper hepatic artery and the other \nfrom the superior mesenteric artery (accessory right hepatic \nartery). While the right hepatic artery typically runs posterior \nto the bile ducts, variations may allow it to course anterior to \nthe common duct, making it vulnerable during surgical pro -\ncedures, particularly if it runs parallel to the cystic duct or in \nthe mesentery of the gallbladder. The cystic artery arises from \nthe right hepatic artery in about 90% of cases, but it may arise \nfrom the left hepatic, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, or \nsuperior mesenteric arteries. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1396.) 12. After identification of a postoperative biliary stricture, \nwhat is the best initial management?\nA. Operative resection of the involved biliary segment \nand reconstruction with an end-to-end roux-en-Y \nhepatico-jejunostomy\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography \n(ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stenting of the \npancreatic duct\nC. Transhepatic catheter placement for biliary \ndecompression\nD. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan\nE. Operative placement of a T-tube at site of biliary \nstrictureAnswer: C\nPatients with bile duct stricture from an injury or as a sequela \nof previous repair usually present with either progressive \nelevation of liver function tests or cholangitis. The initial \nmanagement usually includes transhepatic biliary drainage \ncatheter placement for decompression as well as for defining \nthe anatomy and the location and the extent of the damage. \nThese catheters will also serve as useful technical aids dur -\ning subsequent biliary enteric anastomosis. An anastomosis \nis performed between the duct proximal to the injury and a \nRoux loop of jejunum. Balloon dilatation of a stricture usually \nrequires multiple attempts and rarely provides adequate long-\nterm relief. Self-expanding metal or plastic stents, placed \neither percutaneously or endoscopically across the stricture, \ncan provide temporary drainage and, in the high-risk patient, \npermanent drainage of the biliary tree.

A 36-year-old woman presents with several days of right \nupper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain; which of the \nfollowing findings would best support a diagnosis acute \ncholecystitis?\nA. Cholelithiasis on ultrasound with a 2 mm gallbladder \nwall\nB. Delayed gallbladder filling on hepatobiliary \n iminodiacetic acid (HIDA)\nC. Lack of gallbladder filling on HIDA\nD. Decreased ejection fraction (EF) on HIDAAnswer: C\nThe primary use of biliary scintigraphy is in the diagnosis of \nacute cholecystitis, which appears as a nonvisualized gallblad -\nder, with prompt filling of the common bile duct and duode -\nnum. The lack of gallbladder filling is due to inflammatory \nclosure of the cystic duct preventing bile backflow into the \ngallbladder (Fig. 32-1). Evidence of cystic duct obstruction on \nbiliary scintigraphy is highly diagnostic for acute cholecysti -\ntis. The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis are about \n95% each.

These are absorbed \nin the colon and can then be transported back to the liver. \nEventually, about 95% of the bile acid pool is reabsorbed, \nthe so-called enterohepatic circulation.

For those who do recover after chole -\ncystostomy, the tube can be removed once the track is mature \n(approximately 4 weeks) and cholangiography through it \nshows a patent cystic duct. Elective laparoscopic cholecystec -\ntomy can be scheduled within approximately 6 to 8 weeks, \nassuming their medical fitness recovers.

These classic symptoms, \nknown as Charcot triad, are present in about two-thirds of \npatients. The illness can progress rapidly with the develop -\nment of shock and altered mental status, known as Reynolds \npentad (eg, fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, septic \nshock, and mental status changes).

Endoscopic retrieval at the ileocecal valve\nB. Surgical enterolithotomy to retrieve the stone and \nprimary closure or bowel resection\nC. Surgical enterolithotomy to retrieve the stone if \nbeyond the ileocecal valve\nD. Supportive managementAnswer: B\nManagement of gallstone ileus focuses on relieving the intesti -\nnal obstruction and removing the stone. In cases of very prox -\nimal obstructions in the stomach or duodenum, endoscopic \nretrieval can be effective. For more distal stones, surgical \nenterolithotomy can be accomplished either  laparoscopically \nor open. This procedure entails the removal of the stone \nthrough an enterotomy that is then either repaired or resected \ndepending on its size (Fig. 32-2). Stones that have successfully \ntraversed the ileocecal valve are likely to pass without further \nintervention. The role of pursuing cholecystectomy and/or \ncholedochoenteric fistula closure at the time of enterolithot -\nomy or addressing it at a later time remains a topic of debate, \nbut it should be considered to reduce the risk of recurrence. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1409.)\nBrunicardi_Ch32_p279-288.indd   284 04/07/22   5:43 PM"

VAnswer: E\nCholedochal cysts are classified into five types depending \non the location and structure of the cysts. The subcategories \nof choledochal cysts are defined in Fig. 32-3. Type I cysts \n(fusiform common bile duct [CBD] dilations) are the most \ncommon form, accounting for approximately 50% of cases, \nand have the highest risk of malignancy (>60%). For types I \nand II (saccular diverticula of the common bile duct), exci -\nsion of the cystic dilations in the extrahepatic biliary tree, \nincluding cholecystectomy, with either simple cyst excision or \nduct resection with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is ideal.  \nType III cysts (intraduodenal) create a treatment challenge \nas full resection would require pancreaticoduodenectomy. \nGiven that type III cysts are associated with the lowest malig -\nnancy risk of any choledochal cyst (~2%), sphincterotomy \nand surveillance are generally recommended over formal \nexcision. In Type IV (multiple cysts), excision of all cystic tis -\nsues and reconstruction is again recommended. For type IVa, \nwhich is characterized by multiple cysts with intrahepatic \ninvolvement, additional segmental resection of the liver may  \nbe required if intrahepatic stones, strictures, or abscesses are \npresent. Type V choledochal cysts (Caroli disease) are very \nrare and account for <1% of patients with choledochal cysts. \nThese cysts are multiple and can affect the entire liver. In \nadvanced stages, this may result in cirrhosis and liver  failure \n necessitating liver transplantation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \n p. 1417.)\nFIG. 32-2.  Gallstone Ileus.

All of the above.Answer: D\nPain from chronic pancreatitis has been ascribed to three \npossible etiologies. Ductal hypertension, due to strictures or \nstones, may predispose to pain that is initiated or exacerbated \nby eating. Chronic pain without exacerbation may be related \nto parenchymal disease or retroperitoneal inflammation with \npersistent neural involvement. Acute exacerbations of pain in \nthe setting of chronic pain may be due to acute increases in duct \npressure or recurrent episodes of acute inflammation in the set -\nting of chronic parenchymal disease. Nealon and Matin have \ndescribed these various pain syndromes as being predictive of \nthe response to various surgical procedures. Pain that is found \nin association with ductal hypertension is most readily relieved \nby pancreatic duct decompression, through endoscopic stent -\ning or surgical decompression.

Magnetic resonance cholengiopancreatography \n(MRCP)\nC. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography \n(ERCP)\nD. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)Answer: D\nEUS has heavily impacted the evaluation and management of \npatients with chronic pancreatitis. Although it is more oper -\nator-dependent than transabdominal ultrasonography, EUS \nprovides not only imaging capability but also adds the capac -\nity to obtain cytologic and chemical samples of tissue and fluid \naspirated with linear array monitoring (Fig. 33-2). EUS images \nobtained through a high-frequency (7.5- to 12.5-mHz) trans -\nducer are able to evaluate subtle changes in 2- to 3-mm struc -\ntures within the pancreas and can detect indolent neoplasms in \nthe setting of chronic inflammation. Small intraductal lesions, \nintraductal mucus, cystic lesions, and subtle ductular abnormal -\nities are recognizable by EUS (Table 33-2). This allows ERCP to \nbe reserved for these patients who require therapeutic maneu -\nvers, or for the evaluation of more complex problems. EUS is \ncomparable to ERCP in the detection of advanced changes in \nchronic pancreatitis and may be more sensitive than ERCP in \nthe detection of mild disease.

It remains uncertain, how -\never, whether and to what degree the dichotomy needs to be \nextended into the body and tail.

Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT)\nC. CT with four-phase contrast\nD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Answer: C\nAs with pancreatic exocrine tumors, the initial diagnostic \nimaging test of choice for pancreatic endocrine tumors is a \nmultidetector CT scan with four phases of contrast and fine \ncuts through the pancreas and liver. Neuroendocrine tumors \nof the pancreas often enhance with contrast. EUS can be \nsuperior to CT in localizing these tumors, which can produce \ndramatic symptoms despite their small (<1 cm) size. In con -\ntrast to pancreatic exocrine tumors, many of the endocrine \ntumors have somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) that allow them \nto be detected by a radiolabeled octreotide scan. A radioactive \nsomatostatin analogue is injected intravenously, followed by \nwhole-body radionuclide scanning (Fig. 33-3). The success of \nthis modality in localizing tumors and detecting metastases \nhas decreased the use of older techniques such as angiogra -\nphy and selective venous sampling.

VIPomaAnswer: A\nDiabetes in association with dermatitis should raise the sus -\npicion of a glucagonoma. The diabetes usually is mild. The \nclassic necrolytic migratory erythema manifests as cyclic \nmigrations of lesions with spreading margins and healing \ncenters typically on the lower abdomen, perineum, perioral \narea, and feet. Patients also complain of an enlarged, sensi -\ntive tongue. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring serum \nglucagon levels, which are usually >500 pg/mL. Glucagon is \na catabolic hormone, and most patients present with malnu -\ntrition. The rash associated with glucagonoma is thought to \nbe caused by low levels of amino acids. Preoperative treat -\nment usually includes control of the diabetes, parenteral \n nutrition, and octreotide. Like VIPomas, glucagonomas are \nmore often in the body and tail of the pancreas and tend to \nbe large tumors with metastases. Again, debulking operations \nare recommended in good operative candidates to relieve \n symptoms. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1483.) 11. Treatment of a 1 cm gastrinoma in the wall of the duode -\nnum is best accomplished by:\nA. Enucleation.\nB. Full-thickness resection.\nC. Duodenectomy.\nD. Whipple procedure.Answer: B\nFifty percent of gastrinomas metastasize to lymph nodes or \nthe liver, and are therefore considered malignant. Patients who \nmeet criteria for operability should undergo exploration for \npossible removal of the tumor. Although the tumors are sub -\nmucosal, a full-thickness excision of the duodenal wall is per -\nformed if a duodenal gastrinoma is found. All lymph nodes in \nPassaro triangle are excised for pathologic analysis. If the gas -\ntrinoma is found in the pancreas and does not involve the main \npancreatic duct, it is enucleated. Pancreatic resection is justified \nfor solitary gastrinomas with no metastases. A highly selective \nvagotomy can be performed if unresectable disease is identified \nor if the gastrinoma cannot be localized. This may reduce the \namount of expensive proton pump inhibitors required. In cases \nin which hepatic metastases are identified, resection is justified \nif the primary gastrinoma is controlled and the metastases can \nbe safely and completely removed. Debulking or incomplete \nremoval of multiple hepatic metastases is probably not help -\nful, especially in the setting of MEN1. The application of new \nmodalities such as radiofrequency ablation seems reasonable, \nbut data to support this approach are limited. Postoperatively, \npatients are followed with fasting serum gastrin levels, secretin \nstimulation tests, octreotide scans, and CT scans. In patients \nfound to have inoperable disease, chemotherapy with strepto -\nzocin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is used. Other \napproaches such as somatostatin analogues, interferon, and \nchemoembolization also have been used in gastrinoma with \nsome success. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1482.)\n 13. Which of the following have been proven to signifi -\ncantly reduce the rate of pancreatic leak following \npancreaticoduodenectomy?\nA. Stent\nB. Glue\nC. Octreotide\nD.

Modifications of \nthe anastomotic technique (end-to-side or end-to-end, duct-\nto-mucosa, or invaginated), the use of jejunum or the stom -\nach for drainage, the use of pancreatic duct stents, the use of \noctreotide, and various sealants have all been evaluated.\nLong-acting synthetic analogues of somatostatin have been \nevaluated as a pharmacologic therapy to reduce pancreatic \nsecretion and the rate of pancreatic fistula after pancreatic \nresection.

Which preoperative \nintervention would be most beneficial?\nA. Platelet transfusion\nB. Whole blood transfusion\nC. Fresh frozen plasma\nD. IV immunoglobulinAnswer: D\nIV immunoglobulin, given at 1.0 g/kg per day for 2 to 3 days, \nis indicated for internal bleeding when platelet counts remain \n<5000/mm3, when extensive purpura exists, or to preop -\neratively boost platelets. IV immunoglobulin is thought to \nimpair clearance of immunoglobulin G\u2013coated platelets by \ncompeting for binding to tissue macrophage receptors. An \nimmediate response is common, but a sustained remission is \nnot. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1526.)\n 7. Y ou are evaluating a 55-year-old man in clinic for an \nelective operation.

Herpes Zoster\nD. Measles, mumps, rubellaAnswer: A\nInternational guidelines recommend annual influenza vac -\ncine for asplenic patients. The influenza vaccination provides \nprotection from influenza syndrome and secondary bacte -\nrial infection, and is associated with a 54% reduced risk of \ndeath compared with unimmunized asplenic persons.

Which of the following can -\ncers will the patient be at increased risk for following the \noperation?\nA. Ovarian\nB. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nC. Sarcoma\nD. PancreaticAnswer: B\nA Taiwanese population-based study found that individuals \nwho had splenectomy have higher risks of developing certain \ntypes of cancer (adjusted hazard ratios were 2.64 and 1.29 for \nnontraumatic and traumatic reasons, respectively). Splenec -\ntomy patients were found to have significantly higher risks in \nesophagus, stomach, liver, other head and neck, non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma, and leukemia cancers. Although the exact mecha -\nnism for the possible association between splenectomy and \ncancer remains unclear, a plausible explanation is that the \nspleen is thought to be involved in immunological defenses \nand provides active response through humoral and cell-medi -\nated pathways and that splenectomy may impair immune sur -\nveillance in the host.

Neisseria meningitidis\nD. Escherichia  coliAnswer: D\nMore recently, the bacterial patterns of post-splenectomy \nsepsis have been changing. After the introduction of vaccina -\ntions and new oral antibiotics, postsplenectomy patients can \nsuffer from diverse strains of bacterial infection, which are \nnot strictly correlated with the splenic function. In a recent \ncohort series, gram-negative bacteria are prevalent, repre -\nsenting 45% to 50% of infections in asplenic patients. In vac -\ncinated patients, the rate of sepsis by pneumococcus is very \nlow. In fact, encapsulated bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae, N. \nmeningitidis , and H. influenzae , were rarely encountered in \nthose series in whom vaccination was routinely adopted. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., pp. 1538\u20131539.) 8. Y ou are performing an open splenectomy for symptom -\natic splenomegaly. The spleen is exposed and you have \nexcellent visualization of the associated blood supply. \nWhat vessel do you ligate first?\nA. Splenic artery\nB. Splenic vein\nC. Short gastric arteries\nD. Short gastric veinsAnswer: A\nIn patients with significant splenomegaly, once lesser sac \naccess has been achieved through either the gastrosplenic \nor gastrohepatic attachments, ligating the splenic artery in \ncontinuity along the superior border of the pancreas may \nbe preferable. This maneuver may serve several purposes: \nallowing safer manipulation of the spleen and dissection of \nthe splenic hilum, facilitating some shrinkage of the spleen, \nand providing an autotransfusion of erythrocytes and plate -\nlets. Further medial mobilization of the spleen is achieved by \nincising its lateral peritoneal attachments, most notably the \nsplenophrenic ligament. Then follows individual ligation and \nsequential division of the short gastric vessels, steps that if \ncarefully executed reduce the risk of these vessels\u2019 retracting \nand bleeding. Splenic hilar dissection then takes place. When -\never possible, care should be taken to dissect and individually \nligate the splenic artery and vein (in that order) before divid -\ning them.

Transient \nresponses are more common, however, and many patients \neventually experience hemolysis again despite splenectomy. \nThe decision regarding splenectomy in the case of AIHA \nshould be individualized based on careful consideration of \nthe clinical history and frank discussion with the patient.

Following a splenectomy for chronic hemolytic anemia, \nwhat hemoglobin level is indicative of success?\nA. >7 g/dL\nB. >8 g/dL\nC. >9 g/dL\nD. >10 g/dLAnswer: D\nFor chronic hemolytic anemias, a rise in hemoglobin levels to \n>10 g/dL without the need for transfusion signifies a success -\nful response to splenectomy. By this criterion, splenectomy has \nbeen reported to be successful for the vast majority of patients \nwith chronic hemolytic anemia. For hemolytic anemia due to \nspherocytosis, the success rate is usually higher, ranging from \n90% to 100%. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1524\u20131525.)\n 13. Which of the following is NOT a location where acces -\nsory spleens can be found?\nA. Gastrocolic ligament\nB. Gerota fascia\nC. Large bowel mesentery\nD. Broad ligamentAnswer: B\nThe most common anomaly of splenic embryology is the \naccessory spleen. Present in up to 20% of the population, one \nor more accessory spleen(s) may occur in up to 30% of patients \nwith hematologic disease. Over 80% of accessory spleens are \nfound in the region of the splenic hilum and vascular pedicle. \nOther locations for accessory spleens in descending order of \nfrequency are: the gastrocolic ligament, the tail of the pan -\ncreas, the greater omentum, the greater curve of the stomach, \nthe splenocolic ligament, the small and large bowel mesen -\ntery, the left broad ligament in women, and the left spermatic \ncord in men. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1519.)\n 14. Which of the following splenic ligaments is NOT an \navascular plane?\nA. Gastrosplenic\nB. Splenocolic\nC. Phrenosplenic\nD. SplenorenalAnswer: A\nOf particular clinical relevance, the spleen is suspended \nin position by several ligaments and peritoneal folds to the \ncolon (splenocolic ligament); the stomach (gastrosplenic \nligament); the diaphragm (phrenosplenic ligament); and the \nkidney, adrenal gland, and tail of the pancreas (splenorenal \nligament) (Fig. 34-1). Whereas the gastrosplenic ligament \ncontains the short gastric vessels, the remaining ligaments are \nusually avascular, with rare exceptions, such as in a patient \nwith portal hypertension. The relationship of the pancreas to \nthe spleen also has important clinical implications. In cadav -\neric anatomic series, the tail of the pancreas has been dem -\nonstrated to lie within 1 cm of the splenic hilum 75% of the \ntime and to actually abut the spleen in 30% of patients. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 1519.)considered as a third-line therapy after failure of steroids or \nanti-CD20 antibody administration. Conventional wisdom \nis that splenectomy is not indicated in glucose-6-phosphate \ndehydrogenase deficiency, and certainly the overwhelming \nmajority of patients with G6PD deficiency will neither require \nnor benefit from splenectomy. However, one report described \na small case series of six symptomatic G6PD deficiency \npatients who had severe hemolytic anemia and required \ntransfusion, all of whom were identified to share a common \nmutation at exon 10. All underwent splenectomy. A complete \nresponse occurred in four patients (transfusion requirement \neliminated), and a partial response occurred in one patient \n(transfusion requirement reduced); no follow-up data were \nprovided for the remaining patient. This study indicates that \nfor a carefully select group of patients with severe hemolytic \nanemia attributable to G6PD deficiency, splenectomy may be \nof benefit, although more data is needed before strong recom -\nmendation can be made. The majority of pediatric immune \nthrombocytopenia (ITP) patients recover spontaneously in a \nfew months.

Band 3 proteinAnswer: A\nThe underlying abnormality in HS is an inherited dysfunc -\ntion or deficiency in one of the erythrocyte membrane pro -\nteins (spectrin, ankyrin, band 3 protein, or protein 4.2), which \nresults in destabilization of the membrane lipid bilayer. This \ndestabilization allows a release of lipids from the membrane, \ncausing a reduction in membrane surface area and a lack of \ndeformability, leading to sequestration and destruction of the \nspherocytic erythrocytes in the spleen.\nAlthough less common than glucose-6-phosphate dehy -\ndrogenase (G6PD) deficiency overall, pyruvate kinase defi -\nciency is the most common red blood cell enzyme deficiency \nto cause congenital chronic hemolytic anemia.

Extramedullary site for hematopoesis and recycling \niron.\nC. Initiation of adaptive immune response from filtra -\ntion of lymph.\nD. Clearance of encapsulated bacteria from the blood \nstream.Answer: C\nThe spleen has both fast and slow circulation of blood. It is \nduring slow circulation that blood travels through the reticu -\nlar spaces and splenic cords where it is exposed to contact \nwith splenic macrophages, which remove senescent blood \ncells. Through this process, the spleen is also able to remove \nerythrocyte inclusions such as Heinz bodies without lysing \nthe cells. Through the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen \nclears encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococcus and \nHaemophilus influenzae , which are poorly opsonized from \nthe hepatic reticuloendothelial system. In addition to these \nfunctions, the spleen serves as an extramedullary site for \nhematopoiesis and plays a functional role in the recycling of \niron. While the white pulp of the spleen is important in the \ninitiation of the adaptive immune response, material is deliv -\nered to the spleen through the blood and not the lymph.

A 30-year-old woman presents to her primary care pro -\nvider with complaints of bleeding gums while brushing \nher teeth as well as menorrhagia and several episodes of \nepistaxis within the past month. She has been previously \nhealthy with no prior medical problems or surgeries. \nExamination reveals petechiae and ecchymosis over the \nlower extremities. Laboratory results show white blood \ncell count 7000/mm3, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit \n42%, and platelet count 28,000/mm3 with numerous \nmegakaryocytes on peripheral smear. First-line therapy \nfor this condition would be:\nA. Oral prednisone\nB. IV immunoglobulin\nC. Rituximab\nD. SplenectomyAnswer: A\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune \ndisorder characterized by a low platelet count and mucocuta -\nneous and petechial bleeding. The usual first line of therapy \nfor idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is oral prednisone \nwith most responses occurring within the first 3 weeks after \ninitiating therapy. IV immunoglobulin is given for internal \nbleeding with platelet counts < 5000/mm3, when extensive \npurpura exists, or to increase platelets preoperatively and is \nthought to work by impairing clearance of immunoglobulin \nG-coated platelets by competing for binding to tissue macro -\nphage receptors. Both rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor \nantagonists are second-line treatment options. Splenectomy \nis an option for refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) \nand can provide a permanent response in about 75% to 85% \nof patients. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1526\u20131527.)\n 19. The most common physical finding in a patient with \nhairy cell leukemia (HCL) is:\nA. Massive splenomegaly.\nB. Shortness of breath.\nC. Abdominal pain.\nD. Joint pain.Answer: A\nHCL is an uncommon blood disorder, representing only 2% \nof all adult leukemias. HCL is characterized by splenomegaly, \npancytopenia, and large numbers of abnormal lymphocytes \nin the bone marrow. These lymphocytes contain irregular \nhair-like cytoplasmic projections identifiable on the periph -\neral smear. Most patients seek medical attention because of \nsymptoms related to anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytope -\nnia, or splenomegaly. The most common physical finding is \nsplenomegaly, which occurs in 80% of patients with HCL and \nis often palpable 5 cm below the costal margin. Many patients \nwith HCL have few symptoms and require no specific ther -\napy. Treatment is indicated for those with moderate to severe \nsymptoms related to cytopenias, such as repeated infections \nor bleeding episodes, or to splenomegaly, such as pain or early \nsatiety. Splenectomy does not correct the underlying disor -\nder, but does return cell counts to normal in 40% to 70% of \npatients and alleviates pain and early satiety. Newer chemo -\ntherapeutic agents (the purine analogues 2\u0374-deoxycoformycin  \n[2\u0374-DCF] and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine [2-CdA]) are able to \ninduce durable complete remission in most patients. (See \nSchwartz 11th ed., p. 1527.) 17. The disproportionately high rate of overwhelming post -\nsplenectomy infection in thalassemia patients is thought \nto be due to an immune deficiency. Which of the follow -\ning strategies has been shown to reduce mortality?\nA. Partial splenectomy\nB. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy\nC. Delaying splenectomy until after 2 years of age\nD. Transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin of >9 mg/dLAnswer: A\nThe increase in infectious complications associated with \nsplenectomy in thalassemia patients is thought to be due to a \ncoexisting immune deficiency that is caused by iron overload. \nIron overload is associated with both thalassemia as well as \nthe transfusions that accompany treatment for thalassemia. \nSome investigators have tried partial splenectomy with some \nsuccess in reducing mortality associated with splenectomy in \nthese patients. In addition, splenectomy should be delayed \nuntil the patient is older than 4 years of age unless absolutely \nnecessary. While transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin of \n>9 mg/dL is part of the treatment for thalassemia it does not \nreduce infectious complications associated with splenectomy \nin these patients. There is little evidence supporting efficacy \nof prophylactic antibiotics in asplenic patients in preventing \ninfectious complications associated with splenectomy.

Frequent need for phlebotomy\nC. Symptoms related to splenomegaly\nD. Prevention of progression to myeloid metaplasiaAnswer: C\nPolycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal, chronic, progressive \nmyeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increase in \nred blood cell mass, frequently accompanied by leukocyto -\nsis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. Patients affected by \nPV typically enjoy prolonged survival compared to others \naffected by hematologic malignancies, but remain at risk for \ntransformation to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia \n(AML). The disease is rare, with an annual incidence of 5 \nto 17 cases per million population. Although the diagnosis \nmay be discovered by routine screening laboratory tests in \nasymptomatic individuals, affected patients may present with \nany number of nonspecific complaints, including headache, \ndizziness, weakness, pruritus, visual disturbances, excessive \nsweating, joint symptoms, and weight loss. Physical findings \ninclude ruddy cyanosis, conjunctival plethora, hepatomegaly, \nsplenomegaly, and hypertension. The diagnosis is established \nby an elevated red blood cell mass (>25% of mean predicted \nvalue), thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, normal arterial oxygen \nsaturation in the presence of increased red blood cell mass, \nsplenomegaly, low serum erythropoietin (EPO) stores, and \nbone marrow hypercellularity. Treatment should be tailored to \nthe risk status of the patient and ranges from phlebotomy and \naspirin to chemotherapeutic agents. As in essential thrombo -\ncythemia (ET), splenectomy is not helpful in the early stages \nof disease and is best reserved for late-stage patients in whom \nmyeloid metaplasia has developed and splenomegaly-related \nsymptoms are severe.

Congenital anomalyAnswer: C\nSplenic cysts are rare lesions. The most common etiology for \nsplenic cysts worldwide is parasitic infestation, particularly \nechinococcal. Symptomatic parasitic cysts are best treated \nwith splenectomy, though selected cases may be amenable to \npercutaneous aspiration, instillation of protoscolicidal agent, \nand reaspiration. Nonparasitic cysts most commonly result \nfrom trauma and are called pseudocysts; however, dermoid, \nepidermoid, and epithelial cysts have been reported as well. \nThe treatment of nonparasitic cysts depends on whether or \nnot they produce symptoms. Asymptomatic nonparasitic \ncysts may be observed with close ultrasound follow-up to \nexclude significant expansion. Patients should be advised of \nthe risk of cyst rupture with even minor abdominal trauma  20. Which of the following is an indication for splenectomy \nin a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)?\nA. Failure of chemotherapy to decrease splenomegaly\nB. Sequestration requiring transfusion\nC. Symptomatic relief of early satiety\nD. Presence of bcr gene mutationAnswer: C\nCML is a disorder of the primitive pluripotent stem cell in the \nbone marrow, resulting in a significant increase in erythroid, \nmegakaryotic, and pluripotent progenitors in the peripheral \nblood smear. The genetic hallmark is a transposition between \nthe bcr gene on chromosome 9 and the abl gene on chromo -\nsome 22. CML accounts for 7% to 15% of all leukemias, with \nan incidence of 1.5 in 100,000 in the United States. CML is \nfrequently asymptomatic in the chronic phase, but symptom -\natic patients often present with the gradual onset of fatigue, \nanorexia, sweating, and left upper quadrant pain and early \nsatiety secondary to splenomegaly. Enlargement of the spleen \nis found in roughly one half of patients with CML. Splenec -\ntomy is indicated to ease pain and early satiety.

History of thrombocytopenia\nD. History of neutropeniaAnswer: A\nAlthough rare, splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is the most \ncommon visceral artery aneurysm. Women are four times \nmore likely to be affected than men. The aneurysm usually \narises in the middle to distal portion of the splenic artery. The \nrisk of rupture is between 3% and 9%; however, once rupture \noccurs, mortality is substantial (35%\u201350%). According to a \nrecent series, mortality is significantly higher in patients with \nunderlying portal hypertension (>50%) than in those with -\nout it (17%). SAA is particularly worrisome when discovered \nduring pregnancy, as rupture imparts a high risk of mortal -\nity to both mother (70%) and fetus (95%). Most patients are \nasymptomatic and seek medical attention based on an inci -\ndental radiographic finding. About 20% of patients with SAA \nhave symptoms of left upper quadrant pain. Indications for \ntreatment include presence of symptoms, pregnancy, inten -\ntion to become pregnant, and pseudoaneurysms associated \nwith inflammatory processes. For asymptomatic patients, \nsize > 2 cm constitutes an indication for surgery. Aneurysm \nresection or ligation alone is acceptable for amenable lesions \nin the mid-splenic artery, but distal lesions in close proxim -\nity to the splenic hilum should be treated with concomitant \nsplenectomy. An excellent prognosis follows elective treat -\nment. Splenic artery embolization has been used to treat SAA, \nbut painful splenic infarction and abscess may follow.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\nB. Variceal band ligation\nC. Splenorenal shunt\nD. SplenectomyAnswer: D\nWhile portal hypertension is most commonly a result of cir -\nrhosis it can result from other causes such as splenic vein \nthrombosis. Patients with splenic vein thrombosis can pres -\nent with bleeding from gastric varices in the setting of normal \nliver function and test results. These patients also often have a \nhistory of pancreatic disease. Portal hypertension secondary \nto splenic vein thrombosis is potentially curable with splenec -\ntomy.

ThrombocytopeniaAnswer: D\nThe triad of RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia is called \nFelty syndrome. It exists in approximately 3% of all patients \nwith RA, two-thirds of which are women. Immune complexes \ncoat the surface of white blood cells, leading to their seques -\ntration and clearance in the spleen with subsequent neutro -\npenia. This neutropenia (<2000/mm3) increases the risk for \nrecurrent infections and often drives the decision for splenec -\ntomy. The size of the spleen is variable, from nonpalpable in \n5% to 10% of patients, to massive enlargement in others. The \nspleen in Felty syndrome is four times heavier than normal. \nCorticosteroids, hematopoietic growth factors, methotrex -\nate, and splenectomy have all been used to treat the neu -\ntropenia of Felty syndrome. Responses to splenectomy have if they elect nonoperative management for large cysts. Small \nsymptomatic nonparasitic cysts may be excised with splenic \npreservation, and large symptomatic nonparasitic cysts may \nbe unroofed. Both of these operations may be performed lap -\naroscopically. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1530.)\nBrunicardi_Ch34_p297-306.indd   304 30/06/22   11:26 AM"

Patients under -\ngoing splenectomy for hematologic or malignant indications \nhave a greater risk of OPSI than patients undergoing sple -\nnectomy for trauma or iatrogenic injury and OPSI is more \ncommon in children than adults. Providers need to have a \nhigh index of suspicion when evaluating asplenic patients \nfor possible infection. Patient education and vaccinations \nagainst encapsulated pathogens is the mainstay of preventa -\ntive therapy. Patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks prior to \nelective splenectomy in order to optimize antigen recognition \nand processing. If splenectomy is performed emergently, vac -\ncinations are given postoperatively with an attempt to delay \nadministration for 2 weeks to avoid the transient immuno -\nsuppression associated with surgery. There is little evidence \nsupporting efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in asplenic \npatients and vaccination remains the most effective preven -\ntion strategy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1532.)\n 27. All of the following are TRUE regarding laparoscopic \nsplenectomy EXCEPT:\nA. It is associated with shorter hospital stays.\nB. It is associated with increased intraoperative blood \nloss.\nC. It is associated with decreased morbidity.\nD. Patients are positioned in the right lateral decubitus \nposition or the 45o right lateral decubitus position.Answer: B\nLaparoscopic splenectomy has become the favored procedure \nversus open splenectomy for elective splenectomy over the \npast two decades and is now considered the gold standard for \nelective splenectomy in patients with normal-sized spleens. \nWith experienced surgeons, laparoscopic splenectomy is \nassociated with decreased intraoperative blood loss, shorter \nhospital length of stay, and lower morbidity rates as compared \nto open splenectomy. Laparoscopic splenectomy is often per -\nformed with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position; \npatients are sometimes placed in a 45o right lateral decubitus \nposition to facilitate easier access for concomitant procedures \nsuch as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 1534.)\n 28. What is the most common complication following open \nsplenectomy?\nA. Pancreatitis\nB. Left lower lobe atelectasis\nC. Pleural effusion\nD. Wound infectionAnswer: B\nComplications following splenectomy can be divided into \npulmonary, hemorrhagic, infectious, pancreatic, and throm -\nboembolic. Pulmonary complications include left lower lobe \natelectasis, pleural effusion, and pneumonia with left lower \nlobe atelectasis being the most common complication overall. \nHemorrhagic complications include intraoperative hemor -\nrhage, postoperative hemorrhage, and subphrenic hematoma. \nInfectious complications include subphrenic abscess and \nwound infection. Placement of a drain in the left upper quad -\nrant can be associated with postoperative subphrenic abscess \nand is therefore not routinely recommended. Pancreatic \ncomplications include pancreatitis, pseudocyst formation, \nand pancreatic fistula and often result from intraoperative been excellent, with over 80% of patients showing a durable \nincrease in white blood cell count. More than one-half of \npatients who had infections prior to surgery did not have any \ninfections after splenectomy. Besides symptomatic neutrope -\nnia, other indications for splenectomy include transfusion-\ndependent anemia and profound thrombocytopenia.

The reason for splenec -\ntomy is the single most influential determinant of OPSI risk. \nThere is evidence that those who undergo splenectomy for \nhematologic disease are far more susceptible to OPSI than \npatients who undergo splenectomy for trauma or iatrogenic \nreasons. When taking age into consideration, children who \nare 5 years of age or younger and adults who are 50 years of \nage or older seem to be at an elevated risk. The interval since \nsplenectomy also seems to be a factor with the greatest risk \noccurring in the first 2 years after splenectomy; however, \nit is important to remember that cases of OPSI can occur \ndecades later and asplenic patients remain at lifelong risk. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1538\u20131539.)trauma to the pancreas during dissection of the splenic hilum. \nThromboembolic complications include deep vein throm -\nbosis and portal vein thrombosis.

There is little evidence supporting efficacy of prophy -\nlactic antibiotics.Answer: D\nAntibiotic therapy in asplenic patients falls into three cate -\ngories: deliberate therapy for established or presumed infec -\ntions, prophylaxis in anticipation of invasive procedures, \nand general prophylaxis. There is little evidence supporting \nefficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in anticipation of invasive \nprocedures or efficacy of general prophylaxis and guidelines \nare not uniform.

Resection and primary repair.\nC. Mesh overlay.\nD. Lateral component separation.Answer: A\nRectus abdominis diastasis (or diastasis recti) is a separation \nof the two rectus abdominis muscular pillars. This results in \na bulge of the abdominal wall that is sometimes mistaken for \na ventral hernia despite the fact that the midline aponeurosis \nis intact and no hernia defect is present. Computed tomog -\nraphy (CT) scanning can provide an accurate measure of the \ndistance between the rectus pillars and will differentiate rec -\ntus diastasis from a true ventral hernia.

Familial history.\nC. Female gender.\nD. Developmental dysplasia of the hip.Answer: A\nInguinal hernias may be congenital or acquired. Most adult \ninguinal hernias are considered acquired defects in the \nabdominal wall although collagen studies have demonstrated \na heritable predisposition. A number of studies have attempted \nto delineate the precise causes of inguinal hernia formation; \nhowever, the best-characterized risk factor is weakness in the \nabdominal wall musculature (Table 37-3). Congenital her -\nnias, which make up the majority of pediatric hernias, can \nbe considered an impedance of normal development, rather \nthan an acquired weakness. During the normal course of \ndevelopment, the testes descend from the intra-abdominal \nspace into the scrotum in the third trimester. Their descent \nis preceded by the gubernaculum and a diverticulum of peri -\ntoneum, which protrudes through the inguinal canal and \nbecomes the processus vaginalis. Between 36 and 40 weeks \nof gestation, the processus vaginalis closes and eliminates the \nperitoneal opening at the internal inguinal ring. Failure of the \nperitoneum to close results in a patent processus vaginalis \n(PPV), hence the high incidence of indirect inguinal hernias  3. All of the following are TRUE regarding an incidence  \nof acquired inguinal hernias EXCEPT:\nA. Increases with strenuous activity.\nB. Increases with family history.\nC. Increases with chronic obstructive pulmonary dis -\nease (COPD).\nD. Increases with obesity.Answer: D\nSeveral studies have documented strenuous physical activity  \nas a risk factor for acquired inguinal hernia. A case-  \ncontrolled study of over 1400 male patients with inguinal her -\nnia revealed that a positive family history was associated with \nan eightfold lifetime incidence of inguinal hernia. Chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease also significantly increases the \nrisk of direct inguinal hernias, thought to be due to repeated \ninstances of intra-abdominal pressure during coughing. Sev -\neral studies have suggested a protective effect of obesity. In \na large, population-based prospective study of American \nindividuals (First National Health and Nutrition Examina -\ntion Survey), the risk of inguinal hernia development in \nobese men was only 50% that of normal-weight men, while \nthe risk in overweight men was 80% that of nonobese men. \nA possible explanation is the increased difficulty in detecting \ninguinal hernias in obese individuals.

This technique is indicated for femoral hernias and in \ncases where the use of prosthetic material is contraindicated \n(Fig. 37-2). Once the spermatic cord has been isolated, an \nincision in the transversalis fascia permits entry into the pre -\nperitoneal space. The upper flap is mobilized by gentle blunt \ndissection of underlying tissue. Cooper\u2019s ligament is bluntly \ndissected to expose its surface. A 2- to 4-cm relaxing incision \nis made in the anterior rectus sheath vertically from the pubic \ntubercle. This incision is essential to reduce tension on the \nrepair; however, it may result in increased postoperative pain \nand higher risk of ventral abdominal herniation. Using either \ninterrupted or continuous suture, the superior transversalis \nflap is then fastened to Cooper ligament, and the repair is con -\ntinued laterally along Cooper ligament to occlude the femoral \nring. Lateral to the femoral ring, a transition stitch is placed, \naffixing the transversalis fascia to the inguinal ligament.

Cooper ligament.\nC. A strip of the external oblique aponeurosis.\nD. Prosthetic mesh.Answer: C\nThe Desarda hernia repair was recently described in 2001, \nand it consists of a mesh-free repair utilizing a strip of exter -\nnal oblique aponeurosis. An oblique skin incision is made, \nand dissection is carried down to the external oblique fascia. \nThe integrity of the fascia is preserved as much as possible. \nThe cremasteric muscle is then incised, and the spermatic \ncord along with the cremasteric muscle is separated from the \ninguinal floor.

The medial leaf \nof the external oblique aponeurosis is sutured to the ingui -\nnal ligament from the pubic tubercle to the abdominal ring \nusing 1\u20130 ethilon or prolene interrupted sutures. The first \ntwo sutures are taken at the junction of the anterior rectus \nsheath and esophageal obturator airway (EOA). The last \nsuture is taken so as to sufficiently narrow the abdominal \nring without constricting the spermatic cord (Fig. 37-3). Each \nsuture is passed first through the inguinal ligament, then the  \ntransversalis fascia, and then the EOA.

Cost of robotic and laparoscopic repairs converge as \nvolume grows at each center.\nC. Complications are likely to be less in obese patients \ncompared to open repair.\nD.

One recent study \nhas shown longer operative time, another analysis has shown \nincreased cost. It should be noted, however, that there is a \ndecrease in cost with robotic surgery as the volume of proce -\ndures increases at each center, though it is still unlikely that \nthe costs will ever converge to that of laparoscopic surgery. \nA retrospective, single-institution study has shown greatly \nreduced complication rates with robotic-assisted surgery in \nobese patients; however, this was compared against open  \ninguinal hernia repair (10.8% vs 3.2%, P = 0.047), the two \ngroups were covariate matched for preoperative risk.

Alcohol use.Answer: D\nHernia recurrence: When a patient develops pain, bulging, \nor a mass at the site of an inguinal hernia repair, clinical \nentities such as seroma, persistent cord lipoma, and hernia \nrecurrence should be considered. Common medical issues \nassociated with recurrence include malnutrition, immuno -\nsuppression, diabetes, steroid use, and smoking. Technical \ncauses of recurrence include improper mesh size, tissue isch -\nemia, infection, and tension in the reconstruction. A focused \nphysical examination should be performed. As with primary \nhernias, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), or \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can elucidate ambiguous \nphysical findings. When a recurrent hernia is discovered and \nwarrants re-operation, an approach through a virgin plane \nfacilitates its dissection and exposure. Extensive dissection of \nthe scarred field and mesh may result in injury to cord struc -\ntures, viscera, large blood vessels, and nerves. After an initial \nanterior approach, the posterior laparoscopic approach will \nusually be easier and more effective than another anterior \ndissection. Conversely, failed preperitoneal repairs should \nbe approached using an open anterior repair. (See Schwartz  \n11th ed., p. 1618.)\n 12. Fibrin glue fixation of a synthetic prosthesis is:\nA.

Recent studies \ncomparing fibrin glue fixation and suture fixation in open \nhernia repair show superior rates of chronic pain with both \nLichtenstein and Plug and Patch techniques. Meta-analyses \nof endoscopic hernia repair determined the incidence of \nchronic postoperative pain after tacker fixation was signifi -\ncantly higher than after fibrin glue fixation, with one showing \na relative risk of 4.64 (CI 1.9\u201311.7). Rates of other postop -\nerative complications and recurrence were similar between \nboth fixation methods. Glue fixation is a promising technical \nrefinement, and several studies have shown long-term ben -\nefit; however, its questionable efficacy in larger hernias and \ncost remain considerations.

Nerve entrapment.Answer: C\nOther chronic pain syndromes include local nerve entrap -\nment, meralgia paresthetica, and osteitis pubis. At greatest \nrisk of entrapment are the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric \nnerves in anterior repairs and the genitofemoral and lateral \nfemoral cutaneous nerves in laparoscopic repairs. Clinical \nmanifestations of nerve entrapment mimic acute neuropathic \npain, and they occur with a dermatomal distribution. Injury \nto the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve results in meralgia par -\nesthetica, a condition characterized by persistent paresthesias \nof the lateral thigh. Initial treatment of nerve entrapment \nconsists of rest, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs), physical therapy, and possible local corticosteroid \nand anesthetic injection. Osteitis pubis is characterized by \ninflammation of the pubic symphysis and usually presents as \nmedial groin or symphyseal pain that is reproduced by thigh \nadduction. Avoiding the pubic periosteum when placing \nsutures and tacks reduces the risk of developing osteitis pubis. \nComputed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) excludes hernia recurrence, and bone scan is \nconfirmatory for the diagnosis. Initial treatment is identical \nto that of nerve entrapment; however, if pain remains intrac -\ntable, orthopedic surgery consultation should be sought for \npossible bone resection and curettage.

Occurs in >1% of primary hernia repair.Answer: A\nInjury to spermatic cord structures may result in ischemic \norchitis or testicular atrophy. Ischemic orchitis is most com -\nmonly caused by injury to the pampiniform plexus and not \nto the testicular artery. It usually manifests within 1 week of \ninguinal hernia repair as an enlarged, indurated, and pain -\nful testis, and it is almost certainly self-limited. It occurs in \n<1% of primary hernia repairs; however, this figure is larger \nfor recurrent inguinal hernia repairs.

The result of direct nerve damage or entrapment.\nC. The result of pain conveyed through afferent auto -\nnomic pain fibers.\nD. Characterized as diffuse.Answer: A\nPain after inguinal hernia repair is classified into acute or \nchronic manifestations of three mechanisms: nociceptive \n(somatic), neuropathic, and visceral pain. Nociceptive pain is \nthe most common of the three. Because it is usually a result of \nligamentous or muscular trauma and inflammation, nocicep -\ntive pain is reproduced with abdominal muscle contraction. \nTreatment consists of rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs), and reassurance, as it resolves spontane -\nously in most cases. Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of \ndirect nerve damage or entrapment. It may present early or \nlate, and it manifests as a localized, sharp, burning or tear -\ning sensation. It may respond to pharmacologic therapy and \nto local steroid or anesthetic injections when indicated. Vis -\nceral pain refers to pain conveyed through afferent autonomic \npain fibers. It is usually poorly localized and may occur dur -\ning ejaculation as a result of sympathetic plexus injury.

Risk of intra-abdominal injuries.\nD. Higher short-term recurrence rates.Answer: C\nAlthough controversy persists regarding the utility of TEP vs \nTAPP , reviews to date find no significant differences in opera -\ntive duration, length of stay, time to recovery, or short-term \nrecurrence rate between the two approaches. In TAPP repair, \nthe risk of intra-abdominal injury is higher than in TEP repair. \nThis finding prompted the International Endohernia Society \n(IEHS) to recommend that TAPP should only be attempted \nby surgeons with sufficient experience.

In \nexperienced hands, the overall recurrence rate for the Shoul -\ndice repair is about 1%. Although it is an elegant procedure, \nits meticulous nature requires significant technical expertise \nto achieve favorable outcomes, and it is associated with longer \noperative duration and longer hospital stay. One study found \nthe recurrence rate for Shouldice repairs decreased from \n9.4% to 2.5% after surgeons performed the repair six times.  \nCompared with mesh repairs, the Shouldice technique \nresulted in significantly higher rates of recurrence (OR 3.65,  \nCI 1.79\u20137.47); however, it is the most effective tissue-based \nrepair when mesh is unavailable or contraindicated.

This is because despite compromise of the artery, \nthere is collateral flow from the inferior epigastric, vesi -\ncal, prostatic, and scrotal arteries that supply the testes, and \nin the case of insufficiency, there is atrophy. Treatment for \nischemic orchitis most frequently consists of reassurance,  \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and comfort \nmeasures.

An endobranchial cystAnswer: C\nThe medial thyroid anlage descends from the base of the \ntongue through a channel called the thyroglossal duct at \nweek 3\u20134 of gestation. The duct normally closes after its \ndescent, but may remain patent and is susceptible to second -\nary infection and dilatation, referred to as a thyroglossal duct \ncyst. Removal is accomplished with the Sistrunk operation, \nwhich also removes the central portion of the hyoid bone. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1625\u20131626.) 1. What condition occurs as a complication of total thy -\nroidectomy in patients, particularly in children, who do \nnot receive thyroid replacement therapy?\nA. Sarcoidosis\nB. Myxedema\nC. Dysphonia\nD. PseudohyperparathyroidismAnswer: B\nMyxedema, with the development of cretinous features, was \nan early complication of total thyroidectomy in children. \nIt is prevented by thyroid hormone replacement therapy. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1625.)CHAPTER 38\nThyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal\n 3. The arterial supply of the thyroid arises from which of \nthe following vessels?\nA. The aorta\nB. The external carotid arteries\nC. The thyrocervical trunk\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nThe superior thyroid arteries arise from the external carotid \narteries, and the inferior thyroid arteries arise from the \n thyrocervical trunk shortly after their origin from the sub -\nclavian arteries. A thyroid ima artery arises directly from the \naorta or innominate artery in 1% to 4% of cases. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1628.)\n 4. In what location, relative to the inferior thyroid artery \n(ITA), is the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) found?\nA. Medial or posterior to the ITA\nB. Lateral or anterior to the ITA\nC. Passing between the branches of the ITA\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nThe RLN courses within the tracheoesophageal groove after \nemerging from the vagus nerve at the level of the aortic arch. \nAs it ascends in the neck, the RLN may branch, and may pass \nanterior, posterior, or interdigitate with branches of the ITA. \nThe location of the RLN must be confirmed before the ITA is \ndivided. (See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1628\u20131629.)\n 5. Although injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve results in \nhoarseness (unilateral injury) or airway obstruction (bilat -\neral injury), injury to the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) \nresults in a more subtle injury, affecting the ability to:\nA. Sing high notes.\nB. Whisper.\nC. Protrude the tongue.\nD. Grimace.Answer: A\nThe external branch of the SLN lies on the inferior pharyngeal \nconstrictor muscle and descends alongside the superior thyroid \nvessels before innervating the cricothyroid muscle. Therefore \nthe superior pole vessels should not be ligated en masse, but \nshould be individually divided low on the thyroid gland. Injury \nto the SLN leads to inability to tense the ipsilateral vocal cord, \nand impairs the ability to \u201chit high notes\u201d while singing, or pro -\njecting the voice loudly.

What is the recommended course of action when fine \nneedle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a thyroid nodule is \ninterpreted as \u201csuspicious for malignancy\u201d?\nA. Repeat FNAB\nB. Lobectomy\nC. Lobectomy and isthmusectomy\nD. Total thyroidectomyAnswer: B\nMost papillary and other cancers can be diagnosed by FNAB \nbut the features can be subtle and lobectomy or near-total \nthyroidectomy is recommended because 60% to 75% turn \nout to be malignant. Follicular neoplasms of the thyroid are \nless aggressive than papillary neoplasms, and an FNAB may \nbe unable to differentiate between a follicular adenoma and \na follicular carcinoma. For this reason unilateral lobectomy \nis recommended for this FNAB diagnosis. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1644.) 8. Near-total or total thyroidectomy is preferred for the \ntreatment of Graves disease:\nA. When radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated.\nB. When the goiter is large (>80 g) or airway obstruc -\ntion appears immanent.\nC. In patients with demonstrated poor compliance with \nor tolerance of anti-thyroid medications.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nNear-total or total thyroidectomy is now preferred over sub -\ntotal thyroidectomy due to a lower recurrence rate. Surgery \nis preferred over medical therapy (radioactive iodine) in \nchildbearing women who desire to have children in the near \nfuture, in non-compliant patients, or when airway obstruc -\ntion appears likely. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1637.) 7. Which hormone directly mediates the release of thyroid \nhormones from the gland?\nA. Thyroglobulin\nB. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)\nC. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\nD. AdrenalinAnswer: C\nThyroglobulin is contained within the follicles of the thyroid \ngland and its tyrosine residues are iodinated to produce tetra-\niodothyronine or thyroxin (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). \nTRH is secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates the pitu -\nitary gland to secrete TSH which directly mediates the release \nof T4 and T3 from the gland. Adrenalin does not directly \nregulate T4 or T3 release. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1630.) 6. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) have regulatory roles in \nall of the following EXCEPT:\nA. The hypoxia and hypercapnia drives of the respira -\ntory center in the brain.\nB. Cholesterol synthesis and degradation.\nC. The speed of muscle contraction and relaxation.\nD. Auditory acuity.Answer: D\nThyroid hormones are responsible for maintaining the nor -\nmal hypoxic and hypercapnic drive in the respiratory center of \nthe brain, and regulate cholesterol synthesis and degradation. \nThey also regulate bone and protein turnover and the speed \nof muscle contraction and regulation, gastrointestinal motil -\nity, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and intestinal glucose absorp -\ntion but are not regulators of auditory acuity. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., pp. 1632\u20131633.)\n 10. Which diseases are associated with germline mutations \nin the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene?\nA. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A)\nB. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B)\nC. Hirschsprung Disease\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nMutations in the extracellular domain of the RET tyrosine \nkinase receptor are associated with MEN2A, familial med -\nullary thyroid cancer (FMTC), and Hirschsprung disease. \nMutations in the intracellular domain are associated with \nMEN2B, FMTC, and Hirschsprung disease. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., pp. 1645\u20131646.)\n 11. Children exposed to the Chernoble disaster in 1986 sub -\nsequently demonstrated an increased incidence of which \nthyroid cancer?\nA. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)\nB. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)\nC. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)\nD. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)Answer: A\nPapillary thyroid cancer accounts for 80% of all thyroid malig -\nnancies and is the predominant thyroid cancer in children \nand individuals exposed to external radiation.

What other diseases \nshould be screened for before treatment is undertaken?\nA. Hyperparathryroidism\nB. Pheochromocytoma\nC. Mucocutaneous ganglioneuromas\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nMCT can be spontaneous (in 75%) or familial (in 25%) in \nmultiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). \nMEN2A is associated with pheochromocytoma and hyper -\nparathyroidism, whereas MEN2B is associated with pheo -\nchromocytoma, Marfanoid habitus, and mucocutaneous \nganglioneuromas.

If ultrasound of the neck is normal and calcitonin \nlevels are normal, a formal neck dissection can be avoided. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1656\u20131657.)\n 15. Postoperative complications of thyroid surgery which \nmay require immediate reoperation include:\nA. Hypocalcemia.\nB. Dyspnea.\nC. Dystonia.\nD. Wound hematoma.Answer: D\nInadvertent injury (ischemia) or removal of the parathy -\nroid glands can cause acute neuromuscular excitability due \nto hypocalcemia. This can be ameliorated with intravenous \ncalcium. Dyspnea may be a consequence of pain or anxiety \nbut rarely indicates airway compromise. Bilateral vocal cord \ndysfunction with airway compromise requires reintubation. \nAn expanding hematoma in the neck may not cause bleed -\ning from the wound but can compress the membranous por -\ntion of the trachea and cause dyspnea. The wound should be \nopened at the bedside and the patient returned to the operat -\ning room for wound exploration and reclosure. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1663.) 12.

Left lobectomy.\nB. Left lobectomy and isthmusectomy.\nC. Total left lobectomy and subtotal right lobectomy.\nD. Total thyroidectomy.Answer: D\nTotal thyroidectomy is the recommended treatment particu -\nlarly in younger patients. Prophylactic neck dissection is not \nrequired unless nodal involvement is suspected. Recurrent \ndisease can be treated with radioiodine therapy. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1651.)\n 16.

A 65-year-old woman with mild dementia and elevated \ncalcium and parathyroid hormone levels undergoes \nbilateral neck dissection. Two upper pole parathyroid \nglands and one lower pole parathyroid gland are found \nbut despite a diligent search, the fourth gland is not \napparent. What steps are appropriate to locate the fourth \ngland?\nA. The thyrothymic ligament should be mobilized and \nthe upper end of the thymus gently retracted into the \nfield for dissection and removal if any mass is found.\nB.

Subtotal parathyroidectomy with retention of one-\nhalf of the smallest gland combined with upper \nthymectomyAnswer: A\nTotal parathyroidectomy is contraindicated in patients who \nare candidates for renal transplantation. Subtotal parathy -\nroidectomy with retention of one-half of the smallest gland, \nwith or without upper thymectomy, is considered appropri -\nate, as is total parathyroidectomy with auto-transplantation of \na portion of the smallest gland, depending on surgeon experi -\nence and preference. Recurrent disease after this procedure \ncan be managed with removal of the auto-transplanted gland \navoiding repeat neck exploration. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \npp. 1679\u20131680.) 17.

Computed tomography (CT) scan.\nB. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nC. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan.\nD. Octreotide scan.Answer: D\nPheochromocytomas are solid tumors which appear on \nCT scan as soft tissue masses. They are detected with 85% \nto 95% accuracy, but it is important to avoid intravenous \ncontrast enhancement when a pheochromocytoma is sus -\npected; intravenous contrast can provoke a hypertensive cri -\nsis due to release of catecholamines. MRI is useful to identify \npheochromocytomas, both because they identify soft tissue \nmasses, but also because this tumor tends to enhance on \nT2-weighted images. Radio-labeled MIBG is taken up avidly \nby the pheochromocytoma because its structure is similar to \nnorepinephrine.\nTherefore, the MIBG scan can localize an occult tumor. \nOctreotide scans are not used for pheochromocytoma as \nthe tumor does not overexpress somatostatin receptors.

PheochromocytomaAnswer: B\nCushing\u2019s syndrome refers to any cause of hypercortisolism \ncaused by either an adrenal source or exogenous administra -\ntion of steroids. Cushing\u2019s disease refers only to an adreno -\ncorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-secreting adenoma of the \npituitary gland. Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to an isolated adre -\nnal adenoma is far less common than hypercortisolism due \nto a pituitary adenoma, but adrenalectomy is curative for pri -\nmary adrenal tumors or for adrenal hyperplasia that persists \ndespite efforts to resect a pituitary tumor.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2B.\nC. Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease.\nD. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) disease.Answer: D\nPheochromocytomas are caused by germline mutations in \nthe RET proto-oncogene (the origin of both MEN 2A and \nMEN 2B) as well as the VHL gene mutation. Adrenal and \nextra-adrenal pheochromocytomas may occur spontaneously \nor as part of a neoplastic syndrome, but they are not associ -\nated with the FAP syndrome.

Primary hypercortisolism (Cushing\u2019s syndrome)\nC. Hyperaldosteronism (Conn\u2019s syndrome)\nD. PheochromocytomaAnswer: C\nPrimary aldosteronism, or Conn\u2019s syndrome, is seen in about \n1% of hypertensive patients. It is more common in middle \naged individual and is usually associated with a single ade -\nnoma of the adrenal cortex. The hypertension is usually \nrefractory to medical treatment, and is classically associated \nwith hypokalemia, but may be seen in normokalemic indi -\nviduals.

None of the above.Answer: D\nThe diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is \nmade by chest X-ray with the vast majority of infants devel -\noping immediate respiratory distress and pulmonary hyper -\ntension. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia care has improved \nconsiderably through effective use of improved methods of \nventilation and timely cannulation for extracorporeal mem -\nbrane oxygenation.

Fluid resuscitation with 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline \nwith added potassium until correction of electrolyte \nabnormalities\nB. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline until achieving \na urine output of >2 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours\nC. Immediate laparoscopic pyloromyotomy\nD. Emergent open pyloromyotomyAnswer: A\nGiven frequent fluid and electrolyte abnormalities at time of \npresentation, pyloric stenosis is never a surgical emergency. \nFluid resuscitation with correction of electrolyte abnormali -\nties and metabolic alkalosis is essential prior to induction of \ngeneral anesthesia for operation. For most infants, fluid con -\ntaining 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with added potassium \nof 2 to 4 mEq/kg over 24 hours at a rate of approximately 150 \nto 175 mL/kg for 24 hours will correct the underlying deficit. \nIt is important to ensure that the child has an adequate urine \noutput (>2 mL/kg per hour) as further evidence that rehydra -\ntion has occurred. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1722.) 3. An infant comes to the emergency room with bilious \nemesis and irritability. Physical examination is notable \nfor abdominal tenderness and erythema of the abdomi -\nnal wall. Abdominal X-ray demonstrates dilated proximal \nbowel with air-fluid levels. What is the most appropriate \nnext step in management, after resuscitation?\nA. Upper gastrointestinal series\nB. Barium enema\nC. Gastrostomy\nD. LaparotomyAnswer: D\nThe cardinal symptom of intestinal obstruction in the new -\nborn is bilious emesis. Prompt recognition and treatment of \nneonatal intestinal obstruction can truly be life-saving. Bilious \nvomiting is usually the first sign of volvulus, and all infants \nwith bilious vomiting must be evaluated rapidly to ensure \nthat they do not have intestinal malrotation with volvulus. \nThe child with irritability and bilious emesis should raise par -\nticular suspicions for this diagnosis. If left untreated, vascular \ncompromise of the midgut initially causes bloody stools, but \neventually results in circulatory collapse. Additional clues to \nthe presence of advanced ischemia of the intestine include \nerythema and edema of the abdominal wall, which progress \nto shock and death. It must be reemphasized that the index \nof suspicion for this condition must be high, since abdominal \nsigns are minimal in the early stages. Abdominal films show \na paucity of gas throughout the intestine with a few scattered \nair-fluid levels. When these findings are present, the patient \nshould undergo immediate fluid resuscitation to ensure ade -\nquate perfusion and urine output followed by prompt explor -\natory laparotomy. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1725.) 2. A 4-year-old boy presents with a midline neck mass. On \nphysical examination, the mass is nontender and moves \nup and down with swallowing. There is no drainage or \nerythema and the thyroid gland is palpable in its normal \nanatomic location. A thyroglossal duct cyst is suspected. \nWhat is the appropriate treatment?\nA. Observation\nB. Incision and drainage of the cyst\nC. Resection of the cyst, central portion of the hyoid \nbone and tract to the pharynx\nD. Excision of the cystAnswer: C\nResection of the thyroglossal duct cyst in continuity with the \ncentral portion of the hyoid bone and the tract connecting to \nthe pharynx in addition to ligation at the foramen cecum (the \nSistrunk operation) is curative in >90% of patients. Lesser \noperations result in unacceptably high recurrence rates, and \nrecurrence is more frequent following infection. According \nto a recent review, factors predictive of recurrence included \nmore than two infections prior to surgery, age < 2 years, and \ninadequate initial operation. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1710.)\n 5. The most common form of esophageal atresia (EA) is:\nA. Pure EA (no fistula).\nB. Pure tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) (no atresia).\nC. EA with distal TEF.\nD. EA with proximal TEF.Answer: C\nThe five major varieties of EA and TEF are shown in Fig. 39-2. \nThe most commonly seen variety is EA with distal TEF \n(type C), which occurs in approximately 85% of the cases in \nmost series. The next most frequent type is pure EA (type A), \noccurring in 8% to 10% of patients, followed by TEF without \nEA (type E). This occurs in 8% of cases and is also referred to \nas an H-type fistula, based on the anatomic similarity to that \nletter (Fig. 39-3). EA with fistula between both proximal and \ndistal ends of the esophagus and trachea (type D) is seen in \napproximately 2% of cases, and type B, EA with TEF between \nproximal esophagus and trachea, is seen in approximately 1% \nof all cases.

A metabolic screen is normal, ultrasound dem -\nonstrates an absent gallbladder, and a technetium-99m \niminodiacetic acid scan shows radionuclide that is con -\ncentrated in the liver, but not excreted into the intestine. \nWhich of the following statements is TRUE?\nA. This condition is usually managed nonoperatively.\nB. Surgery should be performed within 60 days of life.\nC. Cystoenterostomy provides adequate biliary \ndrainage.\nD. Most of these patients will not require transplantation.Answer: B\nThis patient has biliary atresia, a rare disease characterized by \nfibroproliferative obliteration of the biliary tree, which pro -\ngresses toward hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver \nfailure. Surgical treatment is the first-line therapy, consisting \nof creation of a hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure). \nNumerous studies suggest that the likelihood of surgical \nsuccess is inversely related to the age at the time of porto -\nenterostomy. Infants treated prior to 60 days of life are more \nlikely to achieve successful and long-term biliary drainage \nthan older infants. Although the outlook is less favorable for \npatients after the 12th week, it is reasonable to proceed with \nsurgery even beyond this time point, as the alternative is cer -\ntain liver failure. Approximately one-third of patients remain \nsymptom-free after portoenterostomy; the remainder require \nliver transplantation due to progressive liver failure. Indepen -\ndent risk factors that predict failure of the procedure include \nbridging liver fibrosis at the time of surgery and postoperative \ncholangitic episodes. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1737.)for the development of diffuse peritonitis, a fixed mass, pro -\ngressive abdominal wall cellulitis, or systemic sepsis.

Congenital anomalies.Answer: C\nInjury is the leading cause of death among children older than \n1 year. In fact, trauma accounts for almost half of all pediatric \ndeaths, more than cancer, congenital anomalies, pneumonia, \nheart disease, homicide, and meningitis combined. Motor \nvehicle collisions are the leading cause of death in people age \n1 to 19 years, followed by homicide or suicide (predominantly \nwith firearms) and drowning. Unintentional injuries account \nfor 65% of all injury-related deaths in children younger than \n19 years. Each year, approximately 20,000 children and teen -\nagers die as a result of injury in the United States. For every \nchild who dies from an injury, it is calculated that 40 others \nare hospitalized and 1120 are treated in emergency depart -\nments. An estimated 50,000 children acquire permanent \ndisabilities each year, most of which are the result of head \ninjuries. Thus, the problem of pediatric trauma continues to \nbe one of the major threats to the health and well-being of \nchildren. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1751.)\n 10. A \u201cdouble bubble\u201d on an abdominal radiograph in an \ninfant is characteristic of:\nA. Duodenal atresia.\nB. Jejunal atresia.\nC. Meconium ileus.\nD. Pyloric stenosis.Answer: A\nWhenever the diagnosis of duodenal obstruction is enter -\ntained, malrotation and midgut volvulus must be excluded. \nOther causes of duodenal obstruction include duodenal atre -\nsia, duodenal web, stenosis, annular pancreas, or duodenal \nduplication cyst. The classic finding on abdominal radiogra -\nphy is the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which represents the dilated \nstomach and duodenum (Fig. 39-5). In association with the \nappropriate clinical picture, this finding is sufficient to con -\nfirm the diagnosis of duodenal obstruction.

Barium enema showing a rectosigmoid ratio > 1Answer: C\nThe definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease is made by \nrectal biopsy. Samples of mucosa and submucosa are obtained \nat 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm from the dentate line. This can be per -\nformed at the bedside in the neonatal period without anesthe -\nsia, as samples are taken in bowel that does not have somatic \ninnervation and is thus not painful to the child. In older chil -\ndren, the procedure should be performed using IV sedation. \nThe histopathology of Hirschsprung disease is the absence of \nganglion cells in the myenteric plexuses, increased acetylcho -\nlinesterase staining, and the presence of hypertrophied nerve \nbundles.

Type II choledochal cysts \nappear as an isolated diverticulum protruding from the wall \nof the common bile duct. The cyst may be joined to the com -\nmon bile duct by a narrow stalk.

Decompress the stomach with an orogastric tube and \nthe rectum with irrigations.\nD. Proceed with reduction and primary closure.Answer: A\nCare must be taken to prevent markedly increased abdominal \npressure during the reduction, which will lead to compres -\nsion of the inferior vena cava, respiratory embarrassment, \nand abdominal compartment syndrome. To avoid this \ncomplication, it is helpful to monitor the bladder or airway \npressures during reduction. In infants whose intestine has \nbecome thickened and edematous, it may be impossible to \nreduce the bowel into the peritoneal cavity in the immediate \npostnatal period. Under such circumstances, a plastic spring-\nloaded silo can be placed onto the bowel and secured beneath \nthe fascia or a sutured silastic silo constructed. The silo cov -\ners the bowel and allows for graduated reduction on a daily \nbasis as the edema in the bowel wall decreases. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1741.)\n 16.

In the \nabsence of peritonitis, the child should undergo radiographic \nreduction. The air enema is diagnostic and may also be cura -\ntive, and it is the preferred method of diagnosis and treat -\nment of intussusception. Air is introduced with a manometer, \nand the pressure that is administered is carefully monitored. \nUnder most instances, this should not exceed 120 mm Hg. \nSuccessful reduction is marked by free reflux of air into mul -\ntiple loops of small bowel and symptomatic improvement as \nthe infant suddenly becomes pain-free. Unless both of these \nsigns are observed, it cannot be assumed that the intussus -\nception is reduced.

Undescended testes are usually repaired by what age?\nA. 6 months\nB. 1 year of age\nC. 2 years of age\nD. 4 years of ageAnswer: C\nMales with bilateral undescended testicles are often infertile. \nWhen the testicle is not within the scrotum, it is subjected to a \nhigher temperature, resulting in decreased spermatogenesis. \nMengel and coworkers studied 515 undescended testicles by \nhistology and demonstrated a decreasing presence of sper -\nmatogonia after 2 years of age. Despite orchidopexy, the inci -\ndence of infertility is approximately two times higher in men \nwith unilateral orchidopexy compared to men with normal \ntesticular descent. Consequently, it is now recommended that \nthe undescended testicle be surgically repositioned by 1 year \nof age.

Patients with limited lymph node involvement may \nbe cured by surgery alone.\nC. Continent neobladders have yet to be successfully \nutilized in patients undergoing cystectomy.\nD. lntravesical chemotherapy prior to surgery is rou -\ntinely used for bladder cancers invading into the \nbladder muscle (T2 lesion).Answer: B\nFor patients who have disease invading into bladder muscle \n(T2), immediate (within 3 months of diagnosis) cystectomy \nwith extended lymph node dissection offers the best chance \nof survival. Patients with limited lymph node involvement \nmay be cured with surgery alone. Patients have multiple \nreconstructive options, including continent and noncon -\ntinent urinary diversions. The orthotopic neobladder has \nemerged as a popular urinary diversion for patients without \nurethral involvement. This diversion type involves the detu -\nbularization of a segment of bowel, typically distal ileum, \nwhich is then refashioned into a pouch that is anastomosed to \nthe proximal urethra (neobladder) or to the skin (continent \ncutaneous diversion). Patients with nonmuscle-invasive blad -\nder cancer (confined to the bladder mucosa or submucosa) \ncan be managed with transurethral resection alone and adju -\nvant intravesical (instilled into the bladder) chemotherapy/ \nimmunotherapy.

Lesions are usually solid but can be cystic.\nB. May be sporadic or hereditary.\nC. Surgical debulking can improve survival in patients \nwho present with metastatic disease.\nD. Patients are not curable (and therefore should not be \noperated on) if tumor thrombus extends proximally \ninto the vena cava.Answer: D\nRenal tumors are usually solid, but they also can be cystic. \nMost cases of RCC are sporadic, but many hereditary forms \nhave been described. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may pres -\nent with metastatic disease, in which case, surgical debulking \ncan improve survival, as shown in randomized controlled tri -\nals. Up to 10% of RCC invades the lumen of the renal vein or \nvena cava. The degree of venous extension directly impacts \nthe surgical approach. Patients with thrombus below the \nlevel of the liver can be managed with cross-clamping above \nand below the thrombus and extraction from a cavotomy \nat the insertion of the renal veins.

Bladder mobilization is not integral to repair of ure -\nteric injury.\nC. Kidney mobilization is not integral to repair of ure -\nteric injury.\nD. Use of ureteric stents is not useful in preventing post-\nrepair strictures.Answer: A\nA retrograde pyelogram is the most sensitive test for ureteral \ninjury. Partial injuries can be primarily repaired, although \nall devitalized tissues must be debrided to avoid delayed \ntissue breakdown and urinoma formation. Ureteral stents \nshould be placed in this situation to facilitate healing with -\nout stricture. Midureteral-level injuries can be treated with a \nuretero- ureterostomy if a spatulated tension-free repair can \nbe achieved. For longer defects, the bladder can be mobi -\nlized and brought up to the psoas muscle (psoas hitch). For \n additional length, a tubularized flap of bladder (Boari flap) \ncan be created and anastomosed to the remaining ureter. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1765\u20131766.) 4.

Radical prostatectomy is associated with a 5% inci -\ndence of permanent urinary incontinence\nD. Once prostate cancer has spread, it is no longer cur -\nable but can be contained by lowering serum testos -\nterone and/or by administration of androgen receptor \nblockers.Answer: C\nThe American Urological Association has advised screen -\ning for men 55 to 69 years of age. The most common site of \nspread of prostate cancer is to the pelvic lymph nodes and \nbone. Radical prostatectomy is associated with early incon -\ntinence and erectile dysfunction. Incontinence improves sig -\nnificantly with time, with <1% of men, in experienced hands, \nsuffering severe long-term problems with urinary control. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1774\u20131775.)\n 8.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accu -\nrate diagnostic test.\nD. Lithotripsy is best for stones located in the middle or \ndistal ureter.Answer: A\nStone formation has been associated with obesity, metabolic \nsyndrome, and diabetes mellitus. Stones are most commonly \ncomposed of calcium oxalate. A noncontrast computer \ntomography (CT) scan is the most sensitive (98%) and spe -\ncific (97%) examination to detect urolithiasis.

Risk factors include smoking, obesity, and hypertension.\nC. Familial syndromes should be suspected in younger \npatients and in patients with bilateral tumors.\nD. Renal masses of any size, if suspicious for malignancy, \nrequire excision as the first therapeutic maneuver.Answer: D\nMost patients diagnosed with RCC in the modern era typi -\ncally present with an incidentally discovered renal mass \non the abdominal radiographic imaging. Renal computed \ntomography (CT) imaging with intravenous contrast remains \nthe single most important radiographic test to determine the \nnature of the mass. Major recognized risk factors for RCC \ninclude obesity and hypertension. Familial RCC subtypes \nwith classical clinical manifestations are also well described. \nManagement options for small renal masses (<4 cm) include \nactive surveillance, thermoablative techniques, or surgical \nexcision. Percutaneous or laparoscopic techniques (cryo -\nablation, radiofrequency ablation, high intensity-focused \n ultrasound) have been used to treat small renal masses, but \nthey are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 1772\u20131773.) 9.

Transurethral resection is the mainstay of invasive \ntherapeutic interventions.\nD. Beta-blockers are the most common pharmacologic \nintervention.Answer: D\nThe prevalence of BPH in men over the age of 50 is estimated \nat 50% to 75% and increases with age with a prevalence of \n80% in men over the age of 70. Complications of BPH include \nurinary retention, incontinence, renal failure, hematuria, or \nrecurrent infections. The first line of treatment is most com -\nmonly pharmacotherapy for those men with bothersome \nsymptoms; alpha blockers work by relaxing the smooth mus -\ncle of the prostate and bladder neck.

Goal of surgical repair is to create a partial urethral \nobstruction.\nD. Urethral rein plantation is sometimes necessary if \nother approaches fail.Answer: D\nStress incontinence is believed to be caused by lack of uretero -\nvaginal support (urethral hypermobility) or intrinsic sphincter \ndeficiency (ISD). ISD is a term applied to a subset of stress-\nincontinent patients who have particularly severe symptoms, \nincluding urine leakage with minimal exertion. This condition \nis often recognized clinically as the low pressure or \u201cdrainpipe\u201d \nurethra. The urethral sphincter mechanism in these patients \nis severely damaged, limiting cooptation of the urethra.  \nStandard surgical procedures used to correct stress inconti -\nnence share a common feature: partial urethral obstruction \nthat achieves urethral closure under stress.

Symptomatically mild cases are best treated with \ngonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).Answer: A\nEndometriosis commonly causes elevations in serum CA-125. \nDefinitive diagnosis usually requires laparoscopy and visual -\nization of the pathognomonic endometriotic implants. These \nappear as blue, brown, black, white, or yellow lesions that can \nbe raised and at times puckered giving them a \u201cgunpowder\u201d  \nappearance.

Choroid plexus production of cerebral spinal fluid in \nexcess of 1L/day leading to subfalcine herniation\nD. ICP classically presenting as hypotension, bradycar -\ndia, and irregular respirationsAnswer: A\nIncreased ICP can injure the brain in several ways. Focal mass \nlesions cause shift and herniation. Temporal lesions push the \nuncus medially and compress the midbrain. This phenom -\nenon is known as uncal herniation . Masses higher up in the \nhemisphere can push the cingulate gyrus under the falx cere -\nbri. This process is known as subfalcine herniation . Diffuse \nincreases in pressure in the cerebral hemispheres can lead \nto central, or transtentorial, herniation. Increased pressure \nin the posterior fossa can lead to upward central herniation \nor downward tonsillar herniation through the foramen mag -\nnum. Uncal, transtentorial, and tonsillar herniation can cause \ndirect damage to the brain stem (Fig. 42-1).

Extravasation of blood \nresults in ecchymosis behind the ear, known as Battle\u2019s sign .   2. The lesion that can cause mass effect and rapidly kill the \npatient is:\nA. Inferior fossa lesions.\nB. Posterior fossa lesions.\nC. Progressive obtundation.\nD. Bradycardial lesions.Answer: B\nThe posterior fossa (brain stem and cerebellum) requires \nspecial consideration because the volume of the posterior \nfossa within the cranial vault is small. Posterior fossa lesions \nsuch as tumors, hemorrhage, or stroke can cause mass effect \nthat can rapidly kill the patient in two ways. Occlusion of the \nfourth ventricle can lead to acute obstructive hydrocephalus, \nraised increased intracranial pressure (ICP), herniation, and \neventually death. This mass effect can also lead directly to \nbrain stem compression (Fig. 42-2). Symptoms of brain stem \ncompression include hypertension, agitation, and progressive \nobtundation, followed rapidly by brain death. A patient exhib -\niting any of these symptoms needs an emergent neurosurgi -\ncal evaluation for possible ventriculostomy or suboccipital \ncraniectomy (removal of the bone covering the cerebellum). \nThis situation is especially critical, as expeditious decompres -\nsion can lead to significant functional recovery.

Definitions vary; some require transient loss of \nconsciousness, while others include patients with any altera -\ntion of mental status. Memory difficulties, especially amne -\nsia of the event, are very common. Studies have shown that \nthe brain remains in a hypermetabolic state for up to a week \nafter injury. The brain is also much more susceptible to injury \nfrom even minor head trauma in the first 1 to 2 weeks after \nconcussion.

C7\u2013T1.Answer: C\nThe cervical nerve roots exit the central canal above the \npedicle of the same-numbered vertebra and at the level of the \nhigher adjacent intervertebral disc. For example, the C6 nerve \nroot passes above the C6 pedicle at the level of the C5\u2013C6 \ndiscs. The cervical nerve roots may be compressed acutely by \ndisc herniation, or chronically by hypertrophic degenerative \nchanges of the discs, facets, and ligaments. Table 42-2 sum -\nmarizes the effects of various disc herniations. Most patients \nwith acute disc herniations will improve without surgery. \nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cervical \ntraction may help alleviate symptoms.

Amputation of the thumb.\nD. Injury to a single digit distal to the proximal inter -\nphalangeal (PIP) joint.Answer: D\nAfter replantation was first reported, replantation was \nattempted for nearly all amputations. Over the ensuing \ndecades, more stringent guidelines have been established \nregarding what should be replanted. Indications for replan -\ntation include amputations of the thumb, multiple digit \namputations, and amputations in children. Relative contra -\nindications to replantation include crush injuries, injuries \nto a single digit distal to the PIP joint, and patients who are \nunable to tolerate a long surgical procedure. As with all guide -\nlines, one should evaluate the particular needs of the injured \npatient. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1938.) 4. Proper handling of an amputated digit or limb includes \nwhich of the following?\nA. Place dry in a waterproof bag.\nB. Immerse in an antiseptic solution.\nC. Prep and wrapped in moistened gauze.\nD. Place on dry ice.Answer: C\nIn preparation for replantation, the amputated part and prox -\nimal stump should be appropriately treated. The amputated \npart should be wrapped in moistened gauze and placed in a \nsealed plastic bag. This bag should then be placed in an ice \nwater bath. Do not use dry ice, and do not allow the part to \ncontact ice directly; frostbite can occur in the amputated part, \nwhich will decrease its chance of survival after replantation. \nBleeding should be controlled in the proximal stump by as \nminimal a means necessary, and the stump should be dressed \nwith a nonadherent gauze and bulky dressing. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 1938.) 3. Anesthetic agents with epinephrine should not be used in:\nA. The fingertip.\nB. The hand.\nC. The wrist.\nD. The forearm.Answer: A\nA commonly held axiom is that epinephrine is unaccept -\nable to be used in the hand. Several recent large series have \ndispelled this myth. Epinephrine should not be used in the \nfingertip and not in concentrations higher than 1:100,000 \n(ie, what is present in commercially available local anesthetic \nwith epinephrine). Beyond that, its use is acceptable and may \nbe useful in an emergency room (ER) where tourniquet con -\ntrol may not be available. Also, because most ER procedures \nare done under pure local anesthesia, many patients will not \ntolerate the discomfort of the tourniquet beyond 30 minutes. \nEpinephrine will provide hemostasis and also prolong the \neffect of the local anesthetic. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1936.) 2. For vascular injuries to the hand requiring tourniquet, \nthe maximum time the tourniquet should be applied to \nprevent tissue necrosis is:\nA. 1 hour.\nB. 2 hours.\nC. 3 hours.\nD. 4 hours.Answer: B\nInitial treatment for an actively bleeding wound should be \ndirect local pressure for no less than 10 continuous minutes. \nIf this is unsuccessful, an upper extremity tourniquet inflated \nto 100 mmHg above the systolic pressure should be used. One \nshould keep this tourniquet time to <2 hours to avoid tissue \nnecrosis. Once bleeding is controlled well enough to evaluate \nthe wound, it may be cautiously explored to evaluate for bleed -\ning points. One must be very cautious if attempting to ligate \nthese to ensure that adjacent structures such as nerves are not \nincluded in the ligature.

            "Text": "CHAPTER  44 Surgery of the Hand and Wrist357\n 7. Which of the following statements about carpal tunnel \nsyndrome is FALSE?\nA. Carpal tunnel syndrome involved the compression of \nradial nerve under the flexor retinaculum.\nB. There is an association with exposure to force and \nrepetition activities, and force and posture.\nC. Syndrome is associated with thenar wasting and loss \nof thumb strength.\nD. Treatment consists of splinting of the wrist at 20\u00b0 to \nbe worn during sleep, steroid injection, and carpal \ntunnel release.Answer: A\nThe most common location of upper extremity nerve com -\npression is the median nerve at the carpal tunnel, called car -\npal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The carpal tunnel is bordered by \nthe scaphoid bone radially, the lunate and capitate bones dor -\nsally, and the hook of the hamate bone ulnarly (see Fig. 44-1).  \nThe transverse carpal ligament, also called the flexor reti -\nnaculum, is its superficial border. The flexor pollicis longus \n(FPL), four flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), and four \nflexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons pass through the \ncarpal tunnel along with the median nerve. Of these 10 struc -\ntures, the median nerve is relatively superficial and radial to \nthe other nine. There is strong evidence of a positive asso -\nciation between exposure to a combination of risk factors \n(eg, force and repetition, force and posture) and CTS. There \nis disagreement among hand surgeons regarding whether \noccurrence of CTS in a patient who does repetitive activities \nat work represents a work-related injury.\nPhysical examination should begin with inspection. Look \nfor evidence of wasting of the thenar muscles. Tinel sign \nshould be tested over the median nerve from the volar wrist \nflexion crease to the proximal palm, although this test has \nsignificant interexaminer variability. Applying pressure over \nthe carpal tunnel while flexing the wrist has been shown in \none series to have the highest sensitivity when compared to \nPhalen and Tinel signs. Strength of the thumb in opposition \nshould also be tested.\nEarly treatment of CTS consists of conservative manage -\nment. The patient is given a splint to keep the wrist at 20\u00b0 \nextension worn at nighttime. Many patients can have years \nof symptom relief with this management. As a treatment and \ndiagnostic modality, corticosteroid injection of the carpal \ntunnel is often employed. Mixing local anesthetic into the \nsolution provides the benefit of early symptom relief (corti -\ncosteroids often take 3\u20137 days to provide noticeable benefit), \nand report of postinjection anesthesia in the median nerve \ndistribution confirms the injection went into the correct loca -\ntion. Multiple authors have shown a strong correlation to relief \nof symptoms with corticosteroid injection and good response \nto carpal tunnel release. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1944.) 6. Which of the following is incorrect about high-pressure \ninjection injuries?\nA. They occur most commonly in the nondominant \nhand at the base of the digit.\nB. They should be treated with elevation and antibiotics, \nwith high rates of recovery.\nC. They require exploration within 6 hours of injury.\nD. Half of these injuries are associated with digit loss.Answer: B\nHigh-pressure devices are commonly used for cleaning and \napplications of liquids such as lubricants and paint. Most \ncommonly, the inexperienced worker accidentally discharges \nthe device into his nondominant hand at the base of the \ndigit. Severity of injury depends on the amount and type of \nliquid injected; hydrophobic compounds cause greater dam -\nage. These injuries are typically quite innocuous to inspec -\ntion. They are, however, digit-threatening emergencies. The \npatient should be informed of the severity of the injury, and \nexploration is ideally performed within 6 hours of injury. Up \nto 50% of such injuries result in loss of the digit, but early rec -\nognition and treatment are associated with increased chance \nof digit survival. Early frank discussion with the patient and \ninitiation of appropriate treatment produce the best results \nand medicolegal protection.

Debridement should begin following confirmation \nby way of radiograph findings.\nD. Oral antibiotics should begin immediately.Answer: A\nBacteria spread along the fascial layer, resulting in the death \nof soft tissues, which is in part due to the extensive blood ves -\nsel thrombosis that occurs. An inciting event is not always \nidentified. Immunocompromised patients and those who \nabuse drugs or alcohol are at greater risk, with intravenous \ndrug users having the highest increased risk. The infection \ncan by mono- or polymicrobial, with group A \u03b2-hemolytic \nStreptococcus  being the most common pathogen, followed by \n\u03b1-hemolytic Streptococcus , S. aureus , and anaerobes. Prompt \nclinical diagnosis and treatment are the most important fac -\ntors for salvaging limbs and saving life. Patients will pres -\nent with pain out of proportion with findings. Appearance \nof skin may range from normal to erythematous or maroon \nwith edema, induration, and blistering. Crepitus may occur if \na gas-forming organism is involved. \u201cDirty dishwater fluid\u201d \nmay be encountered as a scant grayish fluid, but often there \nis little to no discharge. There may be no appreciable leuko -\ncytosis. The infection can progress rapidly and can lead to \nseptic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. \nRadiographs may reveal gas formation, but they must not \ndelay emergent debridement once the diagnosis is suspected. \nIntravenous antibiotics should be started immediately to \ncover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. \nPatients will require multiple debridements, and the spread \nof infection is normally wider than expected based on initial \nassessment. Necrotizing myositis, or myonecrosis, is usually \ncaused by Clostridium perfringens  due to heavily contami -\nnated wounds. Unlike necrotizing fasciitis, muscle is univer -\nsally involved and found to be necrotic. Treatment includes \nemergent debridement of all necrotic tissue along with empir -\nical intravenous antibiotics. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1949.) 8. A patient shown to have wasting at the interdigital web \nspaces, experiences numbness of the ring finger and \nexhibits Wartenberg sign on physical examination most \nlikely is suffering from:\nA. Cubital tunnel syndrome.\nB. Carpal tunnel syndrome.\nC. Compartment syndrome.\nD. Rheumatoid arthritis.Answer: A\nThe ulnar nerve also innervates the dorsal surface of the \nsmall finger and ulnar side of the ring finger, so numbness in \nthese areas can be explained by cubital tunnel syndrome. The \npatient may also report weakness in grip due to effects on the \nflexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons to the ring and \nsmall fingers and the intrinsic hand muscles. Patients with \nadvanced disease may complain of inability to fully extend \nthe ring and small finger interphalangeal (IP) joints.\nPhysical examination for cubital tunnel syndrome begins \nwith inspection. Look for wasting in the hypothenar emi -\nnence and the interdigital web spaces. When the hand rests \nflat on the table, the small finger may rest in abduction with \nrespect to the other fingers; this is called Wartenberg sign. \nTinel sign is often present at the cubital tunnel. Elbow flexion \ntest will often be positive. Grip strength and finger abduction \nstrength should be compared to the unaffected side. Froment \nsign can be tested by placing a sheet of paper between the \nthumb and index finger and instructing the patient to hold on \nto the paper while the examiner pulls it away without flexing \nthe finger or thumb (this tests the strength of the adductor \npollicis and first dorsal interosseous muscles). If the patient \nmust flex the index finger and/ or thumb (FDP-index and \nflexor pollicis longus [FPL], both median nerve supplied) to \nmaintain traction on the paper, this is a positive response. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 1944.)\nBrunicardi_Ch44_p355-360.indd   358 30/06/22   11:28 AM"

Staphylococcus aureus  is the most common infectious \nagent.\nC. Incision and drainage should be through a longitudi -\nnal incision.\nD. The infection extends to the nail bed, and may require \nremoval of the nail.Answer: D\nA felon is a subcutaneous abscess of the fingertip and is most \ncommonly caused by penetrating trauma. S. aureus  is the \nmost common pathogen. The fingertip contains multiple \nsepta connecting the distal phalanx to the skin. These septa \nare poorly compliant, and presence of an abscess will increase \npressure and lead to severe pain and tissue death.

Free flap: flaps that are completely detached from the \nbody prior to their preimplantation with microvascu -\nlar anastomosesAnswer: B\nThe composition of a flap describes its tissue components. \nThe contiguity of a flap describes its position related to its \nsource. Distant flaps are transferred from a different anatomic \nregion to the defect. They may remain attached to the source \nanatomic region (pedicle flaps) or may be transferred as free \nflaps by microsurgery.

Dual antiplatelet therapy \nshould be continued for urgent or emergent procedures \nthat take place before the minimum recommended waiting \nperiod. For semi-elective surgeries in patients with drug-\neluting stents, where the risk of delaying surgery is greater \nthan the risk of in-stent thrombosis, ACC/AHA guidelines \nrecommend surgery be delayed for 180 days. Observational \ndata suggest that the risk of in-stent thrombosis is increased \nfor 180 days after stent implantation, regardless of whether a \nbare metal stent or drug eluting stent is used. (See Schwartz \n11th ed., p. 2035.) 6. In patients who cannot be mask ventilated or intubated \nvia direct laryngoscopy after induction of anesthesia, \nwhich of the following represents the best next step?\nA. Videolaryngosocpy\nB. Laryngeal mask airway insertion\nC. Fiberoptic intubation\nD. Surgical airwayAnswer: B\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) difficult \nairway algorithm covers strategies to deal with difficult intu -\nbation and difficult mask ventilation scenarios. For patients \nin whom anesthesia has been induced, if initial intubation \nattempts are unsuccessful and face mask ventilation is inad -\nequate, supraglottic airway insertion should be considered. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., pp. 2037\u20132039.) 5. A 34-year-old woman presents for elective hernia repair. \nAccording to American Society of Anesthesiologists \n(ASA) guidelines, after what interval from consumption \nof black coffee can anesthesia be induced in this patient?\nA. 2 hours\nB. 4 hours\nC. 6 hours\nD. 8 hoursAnswer: A\nNPO guidelines for preoperative fasting safe intervals after \nintake of food and drink when anesthesia can be induced. \nThe suggested interval after intake of clear liquids is 2 hours, \nafter breast milk is 4 hours, after a light meal (small amount \nof easily digestible food such as toast or crackers) or infant \nformula is 6 hours, and after more food intake is 8 hours. In \nthis patient, anesthesia can be induced 2 hours after intake of \nclear liquids. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 2036.) 4. A patient presents for elective laparoscopic cholecys -\ntectomy. The patient reports a history of cardiac disease \nincluding a non-ST elevation MI 4 years prior that was \ntreated with a drug-eluting stent.

Transthoracic echocardiography.\nC. Stress nuclear perfusion imaging.\nD. No further workup is needed.Answer: D\nPatients who are able to perform 4 METs of exercise or more \ncan typically proceed to surgery without additional evalua -\ntion. The patient presents with a history of stable coronary \ndisease and good exercise tolerance; no further workup \nis needed prior to proceeding. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \npp. 2034\u20132035.)\n 8.

Orientation to time and location.Answer: D\nUnintentional weight loss of >5% from that of the previous \nyear is considered a criterion of frailty. A standard algorithm \nis used to calculate physical activity and is corrected for gen -\nder. Men who expend <383 kcal/wk or women who expend \n<270 kcal/wk may be frail. Grip strength is stratified by body \nmass index and by gender and is also used as a criterion.  \nOrientation to time and place may or may not indicate dementia \nand is not a specific criterion of frailty.

Depletion of intravascular volume\nB. Age-related impairment in the response to \ncatecholamines\nC. Increased myocardial relaxation time\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nAging has been shown to cause a 1% decrease in cardiac out -\nput per year, even in the absence of arrhythmias and cardiac \nischemia. The inability to increase cardiac output during \nstress is dependent on ventricular dilatation and volume sta -\ntus. Incomplete emptying of the ventricle at end systole and \nreduced ejection fraction leads to impaired coronary perfu -\nsion and ischemia. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 2051.) 6. Best practice guidelines for the assessment of nutritional \nstatus include which of the following?\nA. Document height, weight, and body mass index \n(BMI)\nB. Measure baseline serum albumin and prealbumin \nlevels\nC. Document unintentional weight loss during the  \npreceding year\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nA BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 increases the risk of complications due \nto nutritional impairment and may indicate a period of pre -\noperative nutritional support. A serum albumin of <3.0 g/dL \nshould also prompt a referral for a detailed nutritional assess -\nment. Unintentional weight loss of >5% compared to the \nprevious year and weight loss of >10%\u201315% in the preceding  \n6 months may also be an indication for preoperative nutri -\ntional restoration.

Fried and fatty foods\nD. Cooked meatAnswer: A\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists issued new guide -\nlines in 2011 that reduced the fasting period prior to gen -\neral anesthesia. Clear liquids were judged permissible until  \n2 hours before anesthesia, and light foods and full liquids \nwere permissible until 6 hours before anesthesia. Fried and \nfatty foods and meats continue to be restricted for 8 hours \nbefore anesthesia, but other factors which can affect gastric \nemptying such as diabetes may require longer periods of pre -\noperative fasting.

To minimize intervention in patients at high risk of \nimmanent mortality\nC. To improve symptoms, reduce anxiety, and improve \nquality of life\nD. To support patient\u2019s family members and caregiversAnswer: C\nThe role of surgical palliative care is to offer the treatment \nwhich will most likely improve symptoms and reduce anxi -\nety. Quality of life issues are paramount, even if for limited \nperiods of time. The purpose of surgical palliative care is to \nprovide the best care for the patient who is compromised by \nage, disease, or diminished function. (See Schwartz 11th ed., \np. 2053.)\n 13. In frail nursing home residents, what percent of patients \nare alive 1 year after colon cancer resection?\nA. 70%\nB. 50%\nC. 30%\nD. 10%Answer: B\nAmong frail older adults, functional decline after surgery is \nsubstantial and sustained. In one study of frail nursing home \npatients only 53% were alive 1 year after colon resection for \nmalignancy. The same was true for patients who underwent \nlower extremity bypass. Hip replacement was associated with \na 1 year mortality rate of more than one-third of patients. (See \nSchwartz 11 ed., p. 2054.)\n 14. Cancer surgery in elderly patients is:\nA. Always less successful.\nB. Complicated by the fact that clinical trials usually do \nnot include elderly subjects.\nC. Recommended equally as in younger patients.\nD. Does not change overall life expectancy.Answer: B\nThe frequency of referrals for surgical treatment of equiva -\nlent stage cancer is decreased in the elderly for virtually all \ntumors. Despite this, survival after surgery is nearly equiva -\nlent for same stage malignancy as in younger patients. The \ndata derived from clinical trials of adjuvant and neoadjuvant \ntherapy are less helpful for decision making in elderly patients \nbecause elderly subjects are usually not included in clinical \nstudies. (See Schwartz 11 ed., p. 2055.) 11. Preoperative prehabilitation programs have been \nshown to reduce complications in elderly compromised \npatients. What are the components of such a prehabilita -\ntion program?\nA. An at home-based walking program with daily  \nfollow up\nB. Incentive spirometry training beginning one week \nprior to surgery\nC. Education on stress management\nD. All of the aboveAnswer: D\nThe Michigan Surgical Home and Optimization Program has \nincluded preoperative home-based walking; incentive spi -\nrometry; and education about nutrition, stress management, \nand care planning, The program has been found to reduce \npostoperative complications, length of hospital stay and costs. \n(See Schwartz 11 ed., p. 2053.)\n 15. Elderly patients with acute peritonitis may not present \nwith typical symptoms of acute abdominal pain, fever, \nor leukocytosis due to an impaired immune response.

Less than 50%\nB. 70%\u201380%\nC. 90%\u201395%\nD. 100%Answer: A\nIn elderly patients with acute appendicitis or acute cholecys -\ntitis, one-third lack symptoms of abdominal pain, one-third \nare afebrile, and one-third have a normal white blood cell \ncount. Therefore an \u201cunimpressive\u201d abdominal examination \nis irrelevant in the evaluation of the elderly patient whose tol -\nerance for food has suddenly changed. (See Schwartz 11th ed.,  \np. 2055.)\n 16. In elderly patients undergoing heart valve replacement, \nbioprosthetic valves are preferred over synthetic valves \nbecause:\nA. There is less need for anticoagulation which is \nhazardous in the elderly.\nB. The operative time is shorter which reduces the risk \nof pulmonary complications.\nC. Synthetic valves have a higher incidence of manufac -\nturing defects.\nD. The extent of hemolysis is less with bioprosthetic valves.Answer: A\nProlonged anticoagulation is more hazardous in the elderly \nwhere the risk of falls is increased. Even a fall from the \nstanding position can result in a fatal intracranial bleed in \nan anticoagulated patient.

The guiding principle of \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d requires \nthat risks to the patient be minimized.\nD. The fundamental principle is that the discussion of \nbiomedical ethics needs to involve all members of the \ncare team as well as the patient.Answer: B\nIn an apparent conflict or conundrum, the relevant principles \nof autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are \nweighed together with the values at stake to determine jointly \nthe best course of action. (See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 2061.) 1. Biomedical ethics is a system of analysis and deliberation \nwhich is intended to direct physicians and surgeons to \nmoral \u201cgoodness\u201d in patient care. It includes consider -\nation of all of the following EXCEPT:\nA. Autonomy\u2014the patient\u2019s right to decide for himself/\nherself what care will be provided.\nB. Beneficence\u2014the concept that proposed treatments \nwill benefit the patient.\nC. Nonmaleficence\u2014the avoidance of treatments which \nmay harm the patient.\nD. Equipoise\u2014the lack of a preference for one treatment \nover another.Answer: D\nThe patient and the doctor decide together what treatment is \nin the best interest of the patient and share the benefits and \nthe burdens of this joint decision-making. The physician\u2019s \nrole is to clarify the indications, risks, and benefits of the pos -\nsible treatment courses; the patient\u2019s role is to decide what \ncourse to take. Equipoise suggests that neither the patient nor \nthe doctor has a preference, which is not the case. The fourth \ncomponent of biomedical ethics is justice, meaning fairness \nwhere both the benefits and burdens are distributed equally. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 2061.)CHAPTER 48\nEthics, Palliative Care, and Care at the End of Life\n 3.

Where regulations allow, \n\u201ctask sharing, \u201d or training ACPs to deliver surgery and anes -\nthesia services previously allowed only under the purview of \nfully trained specialists, can provide expanded access to care.  \nNon-MD practitioners, known as assistant medical officers  \n(AMOs) or tecnicos de cirurgia  in Mozambique, often have \nextensive operative experience, including obstetrical care, \nand are the primary surgical providers in some regions. Task \nsharing with ACPs also occurs in the United States and other \ncountries where they fill a need otherwise unmet by specialists \neven in major tertiary care centers. However, concerns about \nthe quality of care, lack of adequate supervision, and the effect \non prestige and professional development for specialists and \nACPs, continue to be topics for debate.

Y ou are concerned for cancer and know \nher case fatality rate is significantly higher than a similar \npatient in North America. Why?\nA. Patients present with later stages of cancer.\nB. Patients often decline screening.\nC. Cultural prohibitions preclude surgery as an accept -\nable treatment option.\nD. Improper treatment of surgically correctable disease.Answer: A\nPreviously thought to be a disease almost exclusive to high-\nincome countries, nearly two-thirds of the 7.6 million cancer \ndeaths worldwide occur in low- and middle-income coun -\ntries (LMICs). Mortality from cancer correlates inversely with \na country\u2019s economy for certain treatable cancers, including \nbreast, testicular, and cervical cancer\u2014LMICs have higher \ncase fatality rates. Breast cancer case fatality rates illustrate \nthe great disparity in outcomes between regions. Case fatal -\nity rates in East Africa reach an unacceptable 59% compared \nto 19% in the United States. In LMICs, patients have very \nlimited access to screening. They present for care with much \nlater stages of cancer. The number and quality of training \nprograms in surgical oncology are also inversely related to a \ncountry\u2019s income, leaving LMICs with few adequately trained \nproviders. Collaborative training programs between high-\nincome countries (HIC) and LMIC centers, as well as tele-\nteaching and mobile consultation, may address this shortage \nin a relatively low-cost, high-impact way.

Surgical treatment is often primary prevention for \nadditional disease.\nC. Essential surgical procedures rank among the most \ncost-effective of all health interventions.\nD. All of the above.Answer: D\nThe World Bank arbitrarily defined U.S. $100 per DALY averted \nper day in low-income countries as highly cost-effective.  \nCompared to other public health initiatives, developing basic \nand emergency surgical care at the district level hospital is as \ncost-effective as, or more so, than typical public health programs \nsuch as retroviral treatments for HIV/AIDS or immunization \nfor measles (Fig. 49-1). Male circumcision is one example of  \na well-documented preventative, minor surgical procedure, \ncapable of reducing the transmission of HIV . The DCP3  adopted \na working definition of essential surgical conditions as those \nthat (a) are primarily or extensively treated by surgery; (b) have \na large health burden; and (c) can be successfully treated by a \nsurgical procedure that is cost-effective and feasible to promote \nglobally. Using this definition, the DCP3  identified 44 essen -\ntial procedures, most of which can be performed in first-level \nhospitals (Table 49-1). The first-level (district) hospital is the \nappropriate platform to provide essential surgical service. These \nprocedures rank among the most cost-effective of all interven -\ntions and include those that treat injuries, obstetric complica -\ntions (including fistulas), abdominal emergencies, cataracts, \nand congenital anomalies.

The \nability for disruptive innovations to transform products and \nservices into affordable realities requires three main factors: \na sophisticated technology that simplifies, a low-cost busi -\nness model, and an economically coherent value network \n(Fig. 49-3).

Acute surgical emergencies.\nB. Nonacute surgical conditions.\nC. Obstetrical emergencies.\nD. Organ transplantation.\nE. Trauma care.Answer: D\nIn 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCGS) \nreported that maternal mortality was closely related to den -\nsity of surgical, anesthetic, and obstetrical providers (SAOPs). \nThey showed that maternal mortality throughout the world \nappeared to decrease\u2014by 13.1% on average\u2014for every  \n10 unit increase in SAOPs per 100,000 persons, a strong argu -\nment for addressing maldistribution of providers related to \nsurgical disease. High-priority surgical procedures to improve \nmaternal health include cesarean section, hysterectomy for \npostpartum bleeding and uterine rupture, management of \nectopic pregnancy, and dilatation and curettage. In terms  \nof nonobstetrical acute surgical emergencies, about 90% \ncould be addressed by developing the capability to care for \nthe 10 most common acute surgical conditions in any local \nregion. Even common nonacute conditions can have sig -\nnificant impact on quality of life and socioeconomic status, \nsuch as cleft lip and cleft palate, hernias, and cataracts. Nearly  \n2 million lives could be saved each year if LMICs could design \nand implement simple trauma care initiatives that reduced \nthe case fatality rates among seriously injured patients to \nequal those in high-income countries (HICs) (Fig. 49-2). \nTransplantation, though an area of great interest to people \nin poor countries, still eludes most of the developing world, \nwhere cultural and legal prohibitions preclude cadaveric and \nnonrelated organ donation.

However, the dos -\nages, duration, and frequency of immunonutrition needed to \nimprove surgical outcomes are unknown. Both types of preop -\nerative nutritional supplementation have been demonstrated \nto be beneficial, but there is no statistically significant differ -\nence in infectious complications, complications, or hospital \nlength of stay between the two types.

Preoperative car -\nbohydrate supplementation and early postoperative feeding \nare both recommended. Hyperglycemia that results from \npostoperative fasting can be corrected with exogenous insu -\nlin, and achievement of normoglycemia in the perioperative \nperiod normalizes the main components of metabolism.

Use of multimodal pain strategiesAnswer: D\nMultimodal pain strategies and neuraxial blocks reduce opi -\noid use and therefore minimize nausea and improve early \nenteral nutrition. Routine use of nasogastric tubes is not rec -\nommended to prevent ileus; nasogastric tubes actually delay \nreturn of gastrointestinal activity. Administration of a periop -\nerative mu-opioid receptor antagonist (alvimopan) has been \nassociated with decreased ileus and length of stay in open \nnot laparoscopic surgeries.

Any office outside a hospital that provides invasive \nprocedures to patients outside hospital setting.\nD. Does not need referral from a primary care physician.Answer: B\nASCs are independent health care facilities that offer patients \nthe convenience of having surgery performed safely without \nadmission to a hospital. According to the Centers for Medi -\ncare and Medicaid Services (CMS), effective May 18, 2009, \nASCs are any distinct entity that operates exclusively for the \npurpose providing surgical services to patients not requiring \nhospitalization and which the expected duration of services \nwould not exceed 24 hours following an admission. ASCs \nshould not be confused with office-based surgery practices or \nwith other outpatient centers that provide diagnostic services \nor primary health care, such as urgent care centers, commu -\nnity health centers, mobile diagnostic units, or rural health \nclinics. ASCs are distinguished from other health care facili -\nties by (a) there use of a referral system for accepting patients \nand (b) their maintenance of a dedicated operating room. \n(See Schwartz 11th ed., p. 2153.)CHAPTER 52\nAmbulatory Surgery\n 3.

Patients with private insurance.\nC. Lower median household income.\nD. Greater preoperative comorbidity burden.Answer: B\nSafe use of ASC is based on identification of patients who are \nunlikely to require admission to a hospital after their proce -\ndure. Thus far, ASCs do very well in this aspect. Unplanned \nadmissions after ambulatory surgery occurring approxi -\nmately 0.5% to 2.0% of cases. In the future, ASCs will be chal -\nlenged to reduce this unplanned admissions rate even further. \nPatients with Medicaid insurance, lower median household \nincome, and greater preoperative comorbidity burden have \nthe highest odds of unplanned acute care use. These patients \nmay benefit from interventions that enhance and streamline \npossible to follow-up. Additionally, the potential costs asso -\nciated with postoperative acute care following procedures \nperformed in ASCs are not insignificant. Patient-specific pre -\ndictors of unplanned hospital admissions include age 65 years \nor older, anticipated operating time longer than 120 minutes, \ncardiac comorbidities, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral \nvascular disease, malignancy, positive for human immuno -\ndeficiency virus (HIV) and regional or general anesthesia \nuse. The strongest predictor for unplanned inpatient hospital \nadmission was the individual patient\u2019s own history of previ -\nous hospitalizations, particularly among older adults.

Requirements to open an ambulatory surgery center \n(ASC) in any state include which of the following?\nA. Accreditation by regulating state bodies\nB. Certificate of need\nC. Accreditation by JCAHO\nD. None of the aboveAnswer: D\nHealth care facilities in the United States are highly regu -\nlated by federal and state entities. ASCs are included in this \noversight. Independent observers evaluate the safety and \nquality of care provided in ASC through three processes: \nMedicare certification, state licensure, and voluntary accredi -\ntation. To obtain Medicare certification, ASCs must meet the  \nMedicare certification requirements, known as the conditions \nfor coverage of these conditions include specifying standards \nfor administration of anesthesia, quality evaluation, operat -\ning and recovery rooms, medical staff, nursing services, and \nother aspects of care. An ASC must have an inspection con -\nducted by a state official or a representative of an organiza -\ntion authorized by the government. Each state determines \nthe specific requirements ASCs must meet for licensure. An \nASC does not have to be certified by Medicare in order to \nbe accredited by JCAHO, but if they will be reimbursed by  \nthe Medicare they should meet their requirements.\nIn 37 states, any party looking to open an ASC must demon -\nstrate the need for ASC to exist. State licensure requirements \ngenerally exist for both health care facilities and health care \nprofessionals.

Which of the following strategies for simulation-based \nerror training allows the instructor to engage in a broad \nassessment of learning needs?\nA. Error-enabled approach\nB. Forced-error approach\nC. Error-centric skills assessments\nD. Graduated autonomy approachAnswer: A\nThe error-enabled approach is where the learner can make \nany of a variety of errors during the course of a task. This \nallows for a broad assessment of learning needs. The forced-\nerror approach is where the learner experiences a specific, \nusually unexpected error and demonstrates error manage -\nment as well as options for correction. This approach allows \ninstructors to engage in specific error management skills and \nmetrics. Error-centric assessments allow for evaluation and \ncategorization of errors; these types of assessments allow for \nfocused error training and feedback.
