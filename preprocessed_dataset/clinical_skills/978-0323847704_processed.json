            "Text": "John Macleod (1915 \u20132006)\nJohn Macleod was appointed consultant physician at the Western General Hos-\npital, Edinburgh, in 1950. He had major interests in rheumatology and medical\neducation. Medical students who attended his clinical teaching sessions remember\nhim as an inspirational teacher with the ability to present complex problems with\ngreat clarity. He was invariably courteous to his patients and students alike. He had\nan uncanny knack of involving all students equally in clinical discussions and used\npraise rather than criticism. He paid great attention to the value of history taking\nand, from this, expected students to identify what particular aspects of the physical\nexamination should help to narrow the diagnostic options.\nHis consultant colleagues at the Western welcomed the opportunity of contrib-\nuting when he suggested writing a textbook on clinical examination. The book was\n\ufb01rst published in 1964, and John Macleod edited seven editions. With character-\nistic modesty he was very embarrassed when the eighth edition was renamed\nMacleod \u2019s Clinical Examination . This, however, was a small way of recognising his\nenormous contribution to medical education.\nHe possessed the essential quality of a successful editor \u2013the skill of changing\ndisparate contributions from individual contributors into a uniform style and format\nwithout causing offence; everybody accepted his authority. He avoided being\ndogmatic or condescending. He was generous in teaching others his editorial skills,\nand these attributes were recognised when he was invited to edit Davidson \u2019s\nPrinciples and Practice of Medicine ."

            "Text": "Preface\nDespite the wealth of diagnostic tools available to the modern\nclinician, the acquisition of information by direct interaction with\nthe patient through history taking and clinical examination re-\nmains the bedrock of clinical practice. An expertly performed\nhistory and examination of a patient allow the clinician to reach a\ndifferential diagnosis whilst ensuring the patient and their con-\ncerns remain central to the process, and avoids potential harm\nfrom unnecessary or unjusti \ufb01ed tests.\nThis book aims to assist clinicians in developing the consul-\ntation skills required to elicit a clear history and the practicalexamination skills needed to detect clinical signs of disease.\nWhere possible, the physical basis of clinical signs is explained to\naid understanding. Formulation of a differential diagnosis from\nthe information gained is introduced, and the logical initial in-\nvestigations are included for each system. Macleod \u2019s Clinical\nExamination is designed to be used in conjunction with more\ndetailed texts on pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and\nclinical medicine. It is closely integrated with Davidson \u2019s Princi-\nples and Practice of Medicine and is best read in conjunction\nwith that text.\nIn this edition, the contents have been updated and diversi \ufb01ed\nby a team of existing and new authors, with the aim of creatingan accessible and user-friendly text relevant to clinical practice in\nthe 21st century.\nSection 1 addresses the general principles of good interaction\nwith patients, from the basics of taking a history and examining,\nto the use of pattern recognition to identify spot diagnoses.\nSection 2 deals with symptoms and signs in speci \ufb01c systems\nand Section 3 illustrates the application of these skills to speci \ufb01c\nclinical situations. Section 4 covers the formulation of a diag-\nnosis, the tailored adaptation of clinical skills for everyday prac-\ntice and preparation for assessments of these skills.\nWe hope that if young clinicians are encouraged to adopt and\nadapt these history and examination skills, not only will they serve\ntheir patients well as diagnosticians, but also they will continue to\ndevelop clinical examination techniques and a better under-\nstanding of their mechanisms and diagnostic use.\nThe 15th edition of Macleod \u2019s Clinical Examination is accom-\npanied by an expanded set of clinical videos, including eight\nentirely new topics, which are available in the Elsevier eBooks \u00fe\nlibrary.\nARD, JAI, KF\nEdinburgh, 2023"

            "Text": "The clinical encounter\nThe clinical encounter between a patient and doctor lies at the\nheart of most clinical practice. At its simplest, it is the means by\nwhich people who are ill, or believe themselves to be ill, seek the\nadvice of a clinician whom they trust. Traditionally, the clinical\nencounter is conducted face to face, although non \u2013face-to-face\nor remote consultation using the telephone, video technology or\nonline is increasingly common. This chapter describes the gen-\neral principles that underpin clinical interactions with patients.\nReasons for the encounter\nThe majority of people who experience symptoms of ill health donot seek professional advice. For the minority who do seek help,\nthe decision to consult is usually based on a complex interplay\nof physical, psychological and social factors ( Box 1.1 ). The\nperceived seriousness of the symptoms and the severity of\nthe illness experience can in \ufb02uence whether patients seek help.\nThe perceived severity of symptoms is determined by their in-\ntensity, the patient \u2019s familiarity with them and their duration and\nfrequency. Beyond this, patients try to understand their symp-\ntoms based on their own prior experience and from information\nthey have gathered from a range of sources, including familyand friends, print and broadcast media and the internet and\nsocial media. Patients who present with a symptom are signif-\nicantly more likely to believe or worry that their symptom in-\ndicates a serious or fatal condition than non-consulters with\nsimilar symptoms; for example, a family history of sudden death\nfrom heart disease may affect how a person interprets an\nepisode of chest pain. Patients also weigh up the relative costs\n(\ufb01nancial or other, such as inconvenience) and bene \ufb01ts of\nconsulting. The expectation of bene \ufb01t from a consultation (e.g.\nin terms of symptom relief or legitimisation of time off work) is a\npowerful predictor of consultation. There may also be times\nwhen other priorities in patients \u2019lives are more important than\ntheir symptoms of ill health and deter or delay consultation. It isimportant to consider the timing of the consultation. Why has\nthe patient presented now? Sometimes it is not the experience\nof symptoms themselves that provokes consultation but\nsomething else in the patients \u2019lives that triggers them to seek\nhelp ( Box 1.2 ).\nA range of cultural factors may also in \ufb02uence help-seeking\nbehaviour. Examples of person-speci \ufb01c factors that reduce the\npropensity to consult include stoicism, self-reliance, guilt, un-willingness to acknowledge psychological distress, and embar-\nrassment about lifestyle factors such as addictions. These\nfactors may vary between patients and also in the same person\nin different circumstances and may be in \ufb02uenced by gender,\neducation, social class and ethnicity.\nThe clinical environment\nYou should take all reasonable steps to ensure that theconsultation is conducted in a calm, private environment. For\nface-to-face clinic interactions the layout of the consulting room\nis important and furniture should be arranged to put the patient\nat ease ( Fig. 1.1A ) by avoiding confrontational positioning across\na table and the incursion of computer screens between patient\n1.1Deciding to consult a doctor\n\u0081Perceived susceptibility or vulnerability to illness\n\u0081Perceived severity of symptoms\n\u0081Perceived costs of consulting\n\u0081Perceived bene \ufb01ts of consulting\n1.2Triggers to consultation\n\u0081Interpersonal crisis\n\u0081Interference with social or personal relations\n\u0081Sanctioning or pressure from family or friends\n\u0081Interference with work or physical activity\n\u0081Reaching the limit of tolerance of symptoms\nA\nB\nFig. 1.1 Seating arrangements.

Personal mobile devices can also be\nintrusive if not used judiciously.\nFor hospital inpatients the environment is a challenge, yet\nprivacy and dignity are always important. There may only be\ncurtains around the bed space, which afford very little by way of\nprivacy for a conversation. If your patient is mobile, try to use a\nside room or interview room. If there is no alternative to speaking\nto patients at their bedside, let them know that you understandyour conversation may be overheard and give them permission\nnot to answer sensitive questions about which they feel\nuncomfortable.\nOpening the encounter\nAt the beginning of any encounter, it is important to start to\nestablish a rapport with the patient. Rapport helps to relax and\nengage the person in a useful dialogue. This involves greeting thepatient, introducing yourself and describing your role clearly. A\ngood reminder is to start any encounter with \u2018Hello, my name\nis.\u2019. In face-to-face or video encounters you should wear a\nname badge that can be read easily. A friendly smile helps to put\nyour patient at ease. The way you dress is important; your dress\nstyle and demeanour should never make your patients uncom-\nfortable or distract them. Smart, sensitive and modest dress or\nscrubs are appropriate. Before examining patients or carrying\nout procedures, roll up long sleeves, away from your wrists and\nforearms. Avoid hand jewellery to allow effective hand washing\nand reduce the risk of cross-infection (see Fig. 3.1 ). Tie back long\nhair. You should ensure that the patient is physically comfortable\nand at ease.\nHow you address and speak to a patient depends on the\nperson \u2019s age, background and cultural environment. Some older\npeople prefer not to be called by their \ufb01rst name, and it is best to\nask patients how they would prefer to be addressed. Enquiring\nabout someone \u2019s personal gender pronouns (e.g. she/her, he/\nhim, they/them) can help them feel respected and valued and\naf\ufb01rms their gender identity. Go on to establish the reason for the\nencounter: in particular, the problems or issues the patient wishes\nto address or be addressed. Ask an open question to start with to\nencourage the patient to talk, such as \u2018How can I help you\ntoday? \u2019or\u2018What has brought you along to see me today? \u2019\nGathering information\nThe next task of the clinician in the clinical encounter is to un-\nderstand what is causing the patient to be ill or to believe they are\nill. To do this you need to establish whether or not the patient is\nsuffering from an identi \ufb01able disease or condition, and this re-\nquires evaluation of the patient \ufb01rst by history taking and then by\nphysical examination and investigation where appropriate.\nChapters 2 and 3 will help you develop a general approach to\nhistory taking and physical examination; detailed guidance on\nhistory taking and physical examination in speci \ufb01c systems and\ncircumstances is offered in Sections 2 and 3.\nFear of the unknown and of potentially serious illness ac-\ncompanies many patients as they consult. Reactions to this varywidely, but it can certainly impede clear recall and description.\nPlain language is essential for all encounters. The use of medical\njargon is rarely appropriate because the risk of the clinician and\nthe patient having a different understanding of the same words is\nsimply too great. This also applies to words the patient may use\nthat have multiple possible meanings (e.g. \u2018indigestion \u2019or\n\u2018dizziness \u2019); these terms must always be de \ufb01ned precisely in the\ncourse of the discussion.\nClinicians who \ufb01ll every pause with another speci \ufb01c question\nwill miss the patient \u2019s revealing calm re \ufb02ection, or the hesitant\nquestion or aside that reveals an inner concern. Active listening is\na core skill in clinical encounters, as it encourages patients to tell\ntheir story. It is more than keeping quiet. Encourage the patient\nto elaborate by making encouraging comments or noises, such\nas\u2018Tell me a bit more \u2019or\u2018Uhuh \u2019. Demonstrate that you under-\nstand the meaning of what patients have articulated by re \ufb02ecting\nback statements and summarising what you think they have\nsaid. Nonverbal communication is also important. Look for\nnonverbal cues indicating the patient \u2019s level of distress and\nmood. Changes in your patients \u2019demeanour and body language\nduring the consultation can be clues to dif \ufb01culties that they\ncannot express verbally. If their body language becomes \u2018closed \u2019\n(e.g. if they cross their arms and legs, turn away or avoid eye\ncontact), this may indicate discomfort. Remote consultation in-\ncreases the chance of miscommunication as nonverbal cues are\nnot so readily apparent (see Chapter 21 ).\nHandling sensitive information and third\nparties\nCon \ufb01dentiality is your top priority. Ask your patient \u2019s permission if\nyou need to obtain information from someone else: usually a\nrelative but sometimes a friend or a carer. If the patient cannot\ncommunicate, you may have to rely on family and carers to\nunderstand what has happened to the patient. Third parties may\napproach you without your patient \u2019s knowledge. Find out who\nthey are, their relationship to the patient and whether your patient\nknows that the third party is talking to you. Tell third parties that\nyou can listen to them but cannot divulge any clinical information\nwithout the patient \u2019s explicit permission. They may tell you about\nsensitive matters, such as mental illness, sexual abuse or drug or\nalcohol addiction. This information needs to be sensitively\nexplored with your patient to con \ufb01rm the truth.\nManaging patient concerns\nPatients are not simply the embodiment of disease but in-\ndividuals who experience illness in their own unique way. Iden-\ntifying their disease alone is rarely suf \ufb01cient to permit full\nunderstanding of an individual patient \u2019s problems. In most en-\ncounters you should therefore also seek a clear understanding of\nthe patient \u2019s personal experience of illness. This involves\nexploring the patients \u2019feelings and ideas about their illness, its\nimpact on their lifestyle and functioning. You should seek to\nestablish what is important to them about their illness, and do not\nassume that the medical diagnosis is always a patient \u2019s mainThe clinical encounter \u00815\n1"

However,\nthey also have the potential to expose clinicians to risks,\nespecially when there is a blurring of the boundaries between\ntheir professional and personal lives. Think carefully about pri-\nvacy settings on your personal accounts. As a clinician you\nneed to be careful about whom you share your personal in-\nformation with and, particularly, the type of information you\nshare. You may not intend or wish patients to see your pro \ufb01le\nand posts, but even with appropriate privacy settings you\ncannot be sure someone will not share your information, so\nalways bear in mind who you \u2018friend \u2019,\u2018follow \u2019or allow yourself\nto be \u2018followed by \u2019.

            "Text": "The importance of a clear history\nUnderstanding the patient \u2019s experience of illness by taking a\nhistory is central to the practice of all branches of medicine. The\nprocess requires patience, empathy and understanding to yield\nthe key information leading to correct diagnosis and treatment.\nIn a perfect situation a calm, articulate patient would describe\nclearly their experience of their symptoms in the order of their\noccurrence, understanding and answering supplementary\nquestions where required to add detail and certainty. In reality, a\nmultitude of factors commonly complicate this encounter and\nconfound the clear communication of information. This chapter is\na guide to facilitating the taking of a clear history. Information on\nspeci \ufb01c symptoms and presentations is covered in the following\nsystem chapters.\nGathering information\nBeginning the history\nPreparation\nRead your patient \u2019s past records, if they are available, along with\nany referral, transfer or discharge correspondence before starting.\nAllowing suf \ufb01cient time\nConsultation length varies. In UK general practice the average\nappointment is short, but this is usually adequate, provided the\ndoctor knows the patient and the family and social background.\nIn hospital, the similarly brief time allowed for returning out-\npatients can be challenging for new or temporary staff unfamiliar\nwith the patient. For new and complex problems, a longer\nappointment is usually scheduled. In all settings, clinicians must\nlearn the skill of managing the pace of the consultation to avoid\nrunning late, while not giving any impression that they are short of\ntime. For students, time spent with patients learning and prac-\ntising history taking is highly valuable; however, learning to\ncommunicate ef \ufb01ciently takes time, and patients appreciate\nadvance discussion of the time students need.\nStarting your consultation\nIntroduce yourself and anyone who is with you. The appropriate\nphysical greeting depends on both the cultural and infection\ncontrol context, and since the COVID-19 pandemic, shaking\nhands is no longer usual in UK practice. Con \ufb01rm the patient \u2019s\nname and how they wish to be addressed. If you are a student,\ninform the patient; they are usually happy to help.\nUsing different styles of question\nTo get the patient \u2019s own perspective, begin with open questions\nthat encourage them to think back and report their symptoms in\norder, such as \u2018When did you \ufb01rst notice something wrong, and\nhow did it start? \u2019Listen actively, and encourage the patient to\ntalk by looking interested and making encouraging comments,such as \u2018Tell me more \u2019. Always give the impression that you have\nplenty of time. Allow patients to tell their story in their own words,\nideally without interruption. You may occasionally need to inter-\nject to guide the patient gently back to describing their symp-\ntoms, as anxious patients commonly focus on describing the\nevents or the reactions and opinions of others surrounding an\nepisode of illness rather than what they were feeling. While\navoiding unnecessary repetition, it may be helpful occasionally totell patients what you think they have said and ask if your inter-\npretation is correct (re \ufb02ection).\nThe way you ask a question is important:\n\u0081Open questions are general invitations to talk that avoid\nanticipating particular answers: for example, \u2018What was the\n\ufb01rst thing you noticed when you became ill? \u2019or\u2018Can you tell\nme more about that? \u2019\n\u0081Closed questions seek speci \ufb01c information and are used for\nclari \ufb01cation: for example, \u2018Have you had a cough today? \u2019or\n\u2018Did you notice any blood in your bowel motions? \u2019\nBoth types of question have their place, and normally clinicians\nmove gradually from open to closed questions as the interview\nprogresses.\nThe following history illustrates the mix of question styles and\nresponses needed to elucidate a clear story:\nWhen did you \ufb01rst feel unwell, and what did you feel?\n(Open questioning)\nWell, I \u2019ve been getting this funny feeling in my chest over\nthe last few months. It \u2019s been getting worse and worse,\nbut it was really awful this morning. My husband called\n999. The ambulance came, and the nurse said I was\nhaving a heart attack. It was really scary.\nIt does sound scary for you. When you say a \u2018funny\nfeeling \u2019, can you tell me more about what it felt like?\n(Acknowledging patient \u2019s feelings, open questioning,\nsteering away from events and opinions back to\nsymptoms)\nWell, it was here, across my chest. It was sort of tight, like\nsomething heavy sitting on my chest.\nAnd did you feel it anywhere else? (Open but\nclarifying)\nWell, maybe up here in my neck.What were you doing when it came on? (Clarifying\nprecipitating event)\nJust sitting in the kitchen, \ufb01nishing my breakfast.\nHow long was the tightness there? (Closed)About an hour altogether.\nSo, you felt a tightness in your chest this morning that\nwent on for about an hour and you also felt it in your\nneck? (Re \ufb02ection)\nYes, that\n\u2019s right.\nDid you feel anything else at the same time?

Try to see the\nproblem from their point of view and convey that to them in your\nresponses to what they say and your subsequent questions.\nConsider a young teacher who has recently had dis \ufb01guring\nfacial surgery to remove a benign tumour from her upper jaw.

Learn to think, as you listen, about\nthe broad categories of disease that may present and how these\nrelate to the history, particularly in relation to the onset and rate ofprogression of symptoms ( Box 2.4 ).To complete the history of presenting symptoms, make an\ninitial assessment of how the illness is impacting on the life of\nyour patient. For example, breathlessness on heavy exertion may\nprevent a 40-year-old builder from working but would have much\nless impact on a sedentary retired person. \u2018Can you tell me how\nfar you can walk on a good day? \u2019is a question that can help to\nclarify the normal level of functioning, and \u2018How has this changed\nsince you have been unwell? \u2019can reveal disease impact. Ask if\nthe person undertakes sports or regular exercise, and if they\nhave modi \ufb01ed these activities because of illness.\nWhile taking the history of the presenting complaint you should\nalso explore the patient \u2019s perspective on their symptoms, often\nreferred to as their ideas, concerns and expectations (ICE).\nThese may come up spontaneously or be hinted at (as cues), as\nthe patient responds to open questions, or you may need to ask\ndirectly about them (e.g. \u2018Do you have any ideas about what \u2019s\nhappening here? \u2019\u2018What \u2019s your biggest worry when you think\nabout what this might be? \u2019and \u2018What were you hoping I \u2019db e\nable to do for you today? \u2019).\n2.3Questions to ask about common symptoms\nSystem Question\nCardiovascular Do you ever have chest pain or tightness?\nDo you ever wake up during the night feeling short ofbreath?Have you ever noticed your heart racing or thumping?\nRespiratory Are you ever short of breath?\nHave you had a cough?

            "Text": "Past medical history\nPast medical history may be relevant to the presenting symp-\ntoms (e.g. previous migraine in a patient with headache, orhaematemesis and multiple minor injuries in a patient with\npossible excess alcohol intake). It may reveal predisposing past\nor underlying illness, such as diabetes in a patient with peripheral\nvascular disease, or childhood whooping cough in someone\npresenting with bronchiectasis.\nThe referral letter and case records often contain useful\nheadlines, but the patient is usually the best source. These\nquestions will elicit the key information in most patients:\n\u0081What illnesses have you seen a doctor about in the past?\n\u0081Have you been in hospital before or attended a clinic?\n\u0081Have you had any operations?\n\u0081Do you take any medicines regularly?\nDrug history\nThis follows naturally from asking about past illness. It is good\npractice to try to reconcile all available sources of information\nabout current medication including the drug list on the referral\nletter, the hospital record and the patient \u2019s own recollection of\nwhat they take. Drug history can be complicated by patients \u2019use\nof brand names, descriptions of tablet number, shape and\ncolour, which should always be translated to generic pharma-\nceutical names and quantitative doses for the \ufb01nal record.\nEnquire also about inhalers and topical medications, as patients\nmay assume that you are asking only about tablets. Note all drug\nnames, dosage regimens and duration of treatment, along with\nany signi \ufb01cant adverse effects, in a clear format ( Box 2.5 ). When\ndrugs such as methadone are being prescribed for addiction,\nask the community pharmacy to con \ufb01rm dosage and also to\nstop dispensing for the duration of any hospital admission.\nNon-prescribed drug use\nIn addition to prescribed drugs, ask patients if they take any\nover-the-counter remedies, including herbal and homeopathicremedies and vitamin or mineral supplements. Ask also about\nrecreational drug use. In Britain approximately 30% of the adult\npopulation have used illegal recreational drugs (mainly cannabis)\nat some time. Useful questions are summarised in Box 2.6 .\nConcordance and adherence\nHalf of all patients do not take prescribed medicines as directed.\nPatients who take their medication as prescribed are said to be\nadherent. Concordance implies that the patient and doctor have\nnegotiated and reached an agreement on management, and\nadherence to therapy is likely (although not guaranteed) to\nimprove.\nAsk patients to describe how and when they take their\nmedication. Give them permission to admit that they do not take\nall their medicines by saying, for example, \u2018That must be dif \ufb01cult\nto remember \u2019.\nDrug allergies/reactions\nAsk if your patient has ever had an allergic reaction to a medi-\ncation or vaccine. Clarify exactly what patients mean by allergy,2.5Example of a drug history\nDrug Dose Duration IndicationSide effects/patient\nconcerns\nAspirin 75 mg daily 5 years Started after myocardial\ninfarctionIndigestion\nAtenolol 50 mg daily 5 years Started after myocardial\ninfarctionCold hands (?adherence)\nCo-codamol (paracetamol \u00fe\ncodeine)500 mg paracetamol/8 mg codeine up to 8\ntablets daily4 weeks Back pain Constipation\nSalbutamol MDI 2 puffs as necessary 6 months Asthma Palpitation\nMDI, Metered-dose inhaler.\n2.6Non-prescribed drug history\n\u0081Do you take any drugs that are not prescribed by your doctor?\n\u0081What drugs do you take?\n\u0081How often and how much?\n\u0081How long have you been taking drugs?\n\u0081Have you managed to stop at any time?

            "Text": "as intolerance (e.g. nausea) is much more common than true\nallergy. Drug allergies are overreported by patients: for example,\nonly 1 in 7 who report a rash with penicillin will have a positive\npenicillin skin test. Note other allergies, such as foodstuffs or\npollen. Record true allergies prominently in the patient \u2019s case\nrecords, drug chart and computer records. If patients have had a\nsevere or life-threatening allergic reaction, advise them to wear\nan alert necklace or bracelet.\nFamily history\nStart with open questions, such as \u2018Are there any illnesses that\nrun in your family? \u2019Avoid just asking about a family history of the\npatient \u2019s particular problem. Then follow up the presenting\nsymptoms with a question like \u2018Have any of your family had heart\ntrouble? \u2019Single-gene inherited diseases are relatively uncommon\nin clinical practice. Even when present, autosomal recessivediseases such as cystic \ufb01brosis usually arise in patients with\nhealthy parents who are unaffected carriers (although they may\nhave affected siblings). Many other illnesses are associated with\na positive family history of the same or related illnesses but are\nnot due to a single-gene disorder. For example, a family history\nof one autoimmune disease may increase the likelihood of the\nsame or another autoimmune disease in the patient. A further\ncomplication is that some illnesses, such as asthma and dis-\neases caused by atheroma, are so common in the UK populationthat their presence in family members may not greatly in \ufb02uence\nthe risk to the patient.\nDocument illness in \ufb01rst-degree relatives (i.e. parents, siblings\nand children). If you suspect an inherited disorder such as hae-\nmophilia, construct a pedigree chart ( Fig. 2.1 ), noting whether\nany individuals were adopted. Ask about the health of other\nhousehold members, since this may suggest environmental risks\nto the patient.\nSocial history and lifestyle\nNo medical assessment is complete without determining thesocial circumstances of your patient. These may be relevant to\nthe causes of their illness and may also in \ufb02uence the manage-\nment and outcome. Social deprivation is a powerful predictor of\nmany forms of ill health. Establish who is there to support the\npatient by asking \u2018Who is at home with you, or do you live\nalone? \u2019For those who live alone, establish who is their next of kin\nand who visits regularly to support them. Check if your patient is\na carer for someone vulnerable who may be at risk due to your\npatient \u2019s illness. Enquire sensitively if the patient is bereaved, as\nthis can have profound effects on a patient \u2019s health and\nwellbeing.\nNext establish the type and condition of the patient \u2019s housing\nand how well it suits them, given their symptoms. Patients with\nsevere arthritis may, for example, struggle with stairs. Successful\nFig. 2.1 Symbols used in constructing a pedigree chart, with an example.

            "Text": "management of the patient in the community requires these is-\nsues to be addressed.\nSmoking\nAmong other things, tobacco use increases the risk of\nobstructive lung disease, cardiac and vascular disease, peptic\nulceration, intrauterine growth restriction, erectile dysfunction\nand a range of cancers.\nMost patients recognise that smoking harms health, so\nobtaining an accurate history of tobacco use requires sensitivity.\nAsk if your patient has ever smoked; if so, enquire at what age\nthey started and whether they still smoke. Patients often play\ndown recent use, so it is often helpful to ask about their averagenumber of cigarettes per day over the years and what form of\ntobacco they have used (cigarettes, cigars, pipe, chewed).\nConvert to \u2018pack-years \u2019(Box 2.7 ) to estimate the risk of tobacco-\nrelated health problems. Ask if they have smoked only tobacco\nor also cannabis. Never miss the opportunity during history\ntaking to encourage smoking cessation, in a positive and non-\njudgemental way, as a route to improved health. Do not forget\nto ask non-smokers about their exposure to environmental to-\nbacco smoke (passive smoking).\nAlcohol\nAlcohol causes extensive pathology, including not only hepatic\ncirrhosis, encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy but also\npancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, erectile dysfunction and injury\nthrough accidents. Always ask patients if they drink alcohol\nbut try to avoid appearing critical, as this will lead them to\nunderestimate their intake. If they do drink, ask them to\ndescribe how much and what type (beer, wine, spirits) they\ndrink in an average week. The quantity of alcohol consumed\neach week is best estimated in units; 1 unit (10 mL of ethanol)\nis contained in one standard measure (25 mL) of spirits or half\na pint of 3.8% beer or lager. A small glass (125 mL) of wine\ncontains 1.5 units.\nAlcohol problems\nThe UK Department of Health now de \ufb01nes hazardous drinking as\nanything exceeding 14 units per week for both men and women.Binge drinking, involving a large amount of alcohol causing acute\nintoxication, is more likely to cause problems than if the same\namount is consumed over 4 or 5 days. Most authorities\nrecommend at least two alcohol-free days per week.\nAlcohol dependence occurs when alcohol use takes priority\nover other behaviour that previously had greater value. Warning\nsigns in the history are summarised in Box 2.8 .\nOccupational history\nAsk all patients about their occupation. Clarify what the person\ndoes at work, especially about any chemical or dust exposure. If\nthe patient has worked with harmful materials (e.g. asbestos or\nstone dust), a detailed employment record is needed, includingemployer name, timing and extent of exposure, and any work-\nplace protection offered. Unemployment is also associated with\nincreased morbidity and mortality.\nDiseases caused by occupational exposure particularly affect\nthe lungs; these are dealt with in Chapter 5 on p. 91. Occupa-\ntions associated with speci \ufb01c illness are summarised in Box 2.9 .\nKnowing about the patient \u2019s occupation is also vital for\nassessing how disease may affect lifestyle and livelihood (e.g.\narthritis in a manual labourer or obstructive sleep apnoea in a\nprofessional driver).\nTravel history\nReturning travellers commonly present with illness. They risk\nunusual or tropical infections, and air travel itself can precipitate\ncertain conditions, such as middle-ear problems or deep vein\nthrombosis. The incubation period may indicate the likelihood of\nmany illnesses, but some diseases, such as vivax malaria and\nhuman immunode \ufb01ciency virus, may present a year or more after\ntravel.

Start with \u2018Is there anything else you would like to tell\nme about? \u2019\nBox 2.10 lists common symptoms by system. Asking about all\nof these is inappropriate and takes too long, so judgement and\ncontext are used to select areas to explore in detail. For example:\n\u0081With a history of repeated infections, ask about nocturia,\nthirst and weight loss, which may indicate underlying un-\ncontrolled diabetes.\n\u0081In a patient with palpitation are there any symptoms to sug-\ngest thyrotoxicosis or is there a family history of thyroid dis-\nease?

However, this will alter the dynamic of the consultation\nas the interpreter is an additional participant in the consultation.\nWhere possible, use a professional interpreter and not a family\nmember as this is more likely to ensure you get all the appro-\npriate information. It is very easy to accidentally fall into a con-\nversation with the interpreter rather than with the patient. Ask\nquestions of the patient, not the interpreter; for example, ask,\n\u2018Can you tell me when the chest pain started? \u2019rather than \u2018Can\nyou ask her when the chest pain started? \u2019This will help to ensure\nthat the patient feels heard.

If you do suspect this, ask if\nthey have had any dif \ufb01culties with their memory, then make a\nformal assessment using a cognitive rating scale (p. 372). You\nmay have to rely on a history from relatives or carers.\nSensitive situations\nDoctors sometimes need to ask personal or sensitive questionsand examine intimate parts. If you are talking to a patient who\nmay be suffering from sexual dysfunction, sexual abuse or\nsexually transmitted disease, broach the subject sensitively.\nIndicate that you are going to ask questions in this area, and\nmake sure that the conversation is entirely private. For example:\nBecause of what you \u2019re telling me, I need to ask you\nsome rather personal questions. Is that OK?Can I ask if you have a regular sexual partner?\nFollow this up with:\nIs your partner male or female?If there is no regular partner, ask sensitively:How many sexual partners have you had in the past\nyear?\nHave you had any problems with your relationships or\nin your sex life that you would like to mention?\nEmotional or angry patients\nIll people feel vulnerable and may become angry and frustratedabout how they feel or about their treatment. Staying calm and\nexploring the reasons for their emotion often defuses the situ-\nation. Although their behaviour may be challenging, never\nrespond with anger or irritation and resist passing comment on\nap a t i e n t \u2019s account of prior management.

            "Text": "General principles of physical\nexamination\nThe process of taking a history and conducting a physical\nexamination is arti \ufb01cially separated in classical medical\nteaching, to encourage learners to develop a structured\napproach to information gathering. However, your physical\nassessment of patients undoubtedly begins as soon as you\nsee them, and the astute clinician may notice signs of disease,\nsuch as subtle abnormalities of demeanour, gait or appear-\nance, even before the formal consultation begins. The clinician\ncan be likened to a detective, gathering clues, and the physical\nassessment of a patient can then be seen as the investigation\nitself!\nHistorically, great importance has been placed on the value\nof empirical observation of patients in the formulation of a\ndifferential diagnosis. Modern technological advances have\nincreased the reliance on imaging and laboratory testing for\ndiagnosis, sometimes even at t he bedside (such as portable\nultrasound or near-patient capillary blood ketone testing), and\nthis has called into question the utility of systematic physical\nexamination in modern practice. Nevertheless, the importance\nof performing a methodical and accurate physical examination\ncannot be overstated. The inconstancy of physical signs and\nthe need to monitor patient progress by repeated bedside\nassessment, often conducted by different clinicians, mean that\na standardised approach to physical examination resulting in\nreproducible \ufb01ndings is crucial. Additionally, the interpretation\nof many diagnostic investigations (such as detection of inter-\nstitial oedema on a chest x-ray in heart failure) is subject to\nvariation between clinicians and is not always more sensitive\nthan the detection of physical signs (such as audible crackles\non auscultating the lungs). Furthermore, the utility of many\ndiagnostic investigations relies heavily on the pre-test proba-\nbility (the likelihood of the disease being present prior to the\nt e s tb e i n gp e r f o r m e d ;p .4 1 6 ) ,w h i c hd e p e n d so ni n f o r m a t i o n\ngathered during the history and examination. Finally, there are\na number of conditions, or syndromes, that can be diagnosed\nonly by the detection of a characteristic pattern of physical\nsigns. Thus, by maste ring structured skill s in physical exami-\nnation, clinicians can improve the reliability and precision of\ntheir clinical assessment, which, together with the appropriate\ndiagnostic investigations, lead to accurate diagnosis.\nPreparing for physical examination\nIt is important to prepare both yourself and your patient for thephysical examination. As a clinician, you must take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that you can give the patient your undivided\nattention, in an environment free from interruption, noise or\ndistraction. Always introduce yourself to the patient and seek\npermission to conduct the consultation. Make sure that you have\nthe relevant equipment available ( Box 3.1 ) and that you haveobserved local hand hygiene policies ( Fig. 3.1 ). As discussed on\npage 4, privacy is essential when assessing a patient. At the very\nleast, ensure that screens or curtains are fully closed around a\nward bed; where possible, use a separate private room to avoid\nbeing overheard. Seek permission from the patient to proceed to\nexamination, and offer a chaperone where appropriate to prevent\nmisunderstandings and to provide support and encouragement\nfor the patient. Regardless of whether the patient is the samegender as the doctor or not, chaperones are always appropriate\nfor intimate (breast, genital or rectal) examination. Chaperones\nare also advised if the patient is especially anxious or vulnerable,\nif there have been misunderstandings in the past, or if religious or\ncultural factors require a different approach to physical exami-\nnation. Record the chaperone \u2019s name and presence. If patients\ndecline the offer, respect their wishes and record this in the\nnotes. Tactfully invite relatives to leave the room before physical\nexamination unless the patient is very apprehensive and requests\nthat they stay. A parent or guardian should always be present\nwhen you examine children (p. 343).\nThe room should be warm and well lit; subtle abnormalities of\ncomplexion, such as mild jaundice, are easier to detect in natural\nlight. The height of the examination couch or bed should be\nadjustable, with a step to enable patients to get up easily. An\nadjustable backrest is essential, particularly for patients who feel\nbreathless lying \ufb02at. It is usual practice to examine a recumbent\npatient from the right-hand side of the bed. Ensure that the\npatient is comfortably positioned before commencing the phys-\nical examination.\nSeek permission and sensitively, but adequately, expose the\nareas to be examined; cover the rest of the patient with a\nblanket or sheet to ensure that they do not become cold. Avoid\nunnecessary exposure and embarrassment; a patient may\nappreciate the opportunity to replace their top after examination\nof the chest before exposing the abdomen. Remain gentle to-\nwards the patient at all times, and be vigilant during aspects of\nthe examination that may cause distress or discomfort.\nAcknowledge any anxiety or concerns raised by the patient\nduring the consultation.3.1Equipment required for a full examination\n\u0081Stethoscope\n\u0081Pen torch\n\u0081Measuring tape\n\u0081Ophthalmoscope\n\u0081Otoscope\n\u0081Sphygmomanometer\n\u0081Tendon hammer\n\u0081Tuning fork\n\u0081Cotton wool\n\u0081Disposable\nNeurotips\n\u0081Wooden spatula\u0081Thermometer\n\u0081Magnifying glass\n\u0081Accurate weighing scales and a height-\nmeasuring device (preferably a calibrated,\nwall-mounted stadiometer)\n\u0081Personal protective equipment (disposable\ngloves and apron)\n\u0081Facilities for obtaining blood samples and\nurinalysis22\u0081GENERAL ASPECTS OF EXAMINATION"

The extent of the\nexamination will depend on the symptoms that you are investigating\nand the circumstances of the encounter. Often, in a brief, focused\nconsultation (such as a patient presenting to a general practitioner\nwith headache), a single system (the nervous system in this case)will be examined. In other circumstances, however, a full integrated\nphysical examination will be required, and this is described in detail\non page 424.\nThere is no single correct way to perform a physical exami-\nnation, but standardised systematic approaches help to ensure\nthat nothing is omitted. With experience, you will develop your\nown style and sequence of physical examination.

This structured approach to the examination of the\nsystem can be summarised as:\n\u0081inspection\n\u0081palpation\n\u0081percussion\n\u0081auscultation.\nInitial observations\nThe physical examination begins as soon as you see the patient.\nStart with a rapid assessment of how unwell the patient is, since\nthe clinical assessment may have to be adjusted for a deterio-\nrating or dying patient, and any abnormal physiology may need\nto be addressed urgently before the actual diagnosis is found\n(see Chapter 18 , p. 395). Early warning scoring systems (which\ninclude assessment of vital signs: pulse, blood pressure, respi-\nratory rate and oxygen saturations, temperature, conscious level\nand pain score) are used routinely to assess unwell patients, andthese clinical measurements aid decisions about illness severity\nand urgency of assessment (see Chapter 18 , p. 394). If your\npatient is distressed or in pain, giving effective analgesia may\ntake priority before undertaking a more structured evaluation,\nalthough a concurrent evaluation for the cause of the pain is\nclearly important.\nFor the stable or generally well patient, a more measured\nassessment can begin. Observe the patient before the consultation\nbegins. Do they look generally well or unwell? What is their\ndemeanour? Are they sitting up comfortably reading or on the\ntelephone to a relative, or do they seem withdrawn, distressed or\nconfused?\nNotice the patient \u2019s attire. Are they dressed appropriately?\nClothing gives clues about personality, state of mind and social\ncircumstances, as well as a patient \u2019sp h y s i c a ls t a t e .P a t i e n t sw i t h\nrecent weight loss may be wearing clothes that look baggy and\nloose. Are there signs of self-neglect (which may be underpinned\nby other factors, such as cognitive impairment, immobility, or drug\nor alcohol dependence) or inappropriate attire? For example, a\npatient with thyrotoxicosis may come to see you dressed for\nsummer in the depths of winter due to heat intolerance.\nOften, there will be clues to the patient \u2019s underlying medical\ncondition given by the person \u2019s effects (e.g. they may be\nwearing a subcutaneous insulin pump to treat their type 1\ndiabetes, or carrying a portable oxygen cylinder if they have\npulmonary \ufb01brosis). If they are in bed, look on the bedside table\nfor a hearing aid, peak \ufb02ow meter or inhaler device, and note\nany walking aid, commode and wheelchair, which provide clues\nto the patient \u2019s functional status. Patients may be wearing a\nmedical identity bracelet or other jewellery alerting you to an\nunderlying medical condition or life-sustaining treatment. Note\nany tattoos or piercings; as well as alerting you to possible\nassociated infections, these can provide important backgroundinformation ( Fig. 3.2 ). Be sure to look for any venepuncture\nmarks of intravenous drug use ( Fig .3.3 )o rl i n e a r( u s u a l l y\ntransverse) scars from recent or previous deliberate self-harm\n(Fig. 3.4 ).\nFig. 3.2 Tattoos can be revealing.\nFig. 3.3 The linear marks of intravenous injection at the right ante-\ncubital fossa.\nFig. 3.4 Scars from deliberate self-harm (cutting).24\u0081GENERAL ASPECTS OF EXAMINATION"

Is the gait\nnormal or is there evidence of pain, immobility or weakness?\nAbnormalities of gait can be pathognomonic signs of neuro-\nlogical or musculoskeletal disease: for example, the hemiplegic\ngait after stroke, the ataxic gait of cerebellar disease or the\nmarche \u00e0 petits pas (\u2018walk of little steps \u2019) gait in a patient with\ndiffuse cerebrovascular disease or Parkinsonism (see Fig. 7.17 ,\np. 152).

Reluctance to engage in the\nconsultation may indicate underlying depression, anxiety, fear,\nanger or grief, and it is important to recognise these emotions\nto ensure that both the physical and the emotional needs of the\npatient are addressed. Some people conceal anxieties and\ndepression with inappropriate cheerfulness. Illness itself may\nalter demeanour: frontal lobe disease or bipolar disorders may\nlead to animated disinhibition, whereas poverty of expression\nmay occur in depression or Parkinson \u2019s disease. Physical signs\nin the face that are associated with speci \ufb01c diagnoses are\ncovered later ( Box 3.7 , p. 38).\nListen for abnormalities in the character of speech, such as\nslurring (due to alcohol, for example, or dysarthria caused bymotor neurone disease; p. 369), hoarseness (which can\nrepresent recurrent laryngeal nerve damage; p. 215), or ab-\nnormality of speech cadence (which could be caused by\npressure of speech in hyperthyroidism or slowing of speech in\nmyxoedema; p. 222).Hands\nSome conditions are associated with pathognomonic signs. For\nexample, the rare disease myotonic dystrophy (which is over-\nrepresented in candidate assessments) causes a patient to fail\nto release a handgrip (due to delayed muscle relaxation). A pa-\ntient with neurological disease may be unable to move their hand\nor may have signs of muscle wasting or tremor. Detailed ex-\namination of the hands is described on page 303, but even a\nbrief inspection and palpation may be very revealing.\nDeformity\nDeformity in the hands may indicate nerve palsies or arthritic\nchanges (such as ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal\njoints in longstanding rheumatoid arthritis; see Fig. 13.22 ,p .\n266). Arthritis frequently involves the small joints of the hands.\nRheumatoid arthritis typically affects metacarpophalangeal and\nproximal interphalangeal joints ( Fig. 13.22 , p. 266), and osteo-\narthritis and psoriatic arthropathy affect the distal interphalangeal\njoints ( Fig. 13.8 , p. 295). Small-muscle wasting of the hands is\ncommon in rheumatoid arthritis, producing \u2018dorsal guttering \u2019of\nthe hands, and also occurs in cervical spondylosis with nerve\nroot entrapment. In carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve\ncompression leads to wasting of the thenar muscles, also seen in\ndamage affecting the T1 nerve root ( Fig. 13.23 , p. 305).\nDupuytren \u2019s contracture is a thickening of the palmar fascia\ncausing \ufb01xed \ufb02exion deformity, and it usually affects the little and\nring \ufb01ngers ( Fig. 3.5 ). Arachnodactyly (long, thin \ufb01ngers) is typical\nof Marfan \u2019s syndrome ( Fig. 3.21B ).

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the\nhands may be cyanosed due to reduced arterial oxygen satu-ration but warm due to vasodilatation from elevated arterial\ncarbon dioxide levels.

In everyday practice, the skin can provide insights\ninto present and past medical disorders, as well as information\nabout the patient \u2019s social or mental status.\nThe skin should be exposed where appropriate and inspected\ncarefully for any abnormalities of pigmentation. Skin colour is\ndetermined by pigments \u2013melanin, an endogenous brown\npigment, and carotene, an exogenous yellow pigment (derived\nmainly from ingestion of carrots and other vegetables) \u2013as wellas by the amount of oxyhaemoglobin (red) and deoxy-\nhaemoglobin (dusky blue) circulating in the dermis.\nThe autoimmune condition vitiligo causes irregular pale\npatches of skin depigmentation ( Fig. 3.10 ), commonly on the\nface, neck, hands and extensor aspects of the limbs. It can be\nsymmetrical, but often is not. It is associated with other auto-\nimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid and ad-\nrenal disorders and pernicious anaemia. Hypopituitarism alsoresults in pale skin due to reduced production of melanotrophic\npeptides. Albinism is an inherited disorder in which patients\nhave little or no melanin in their skin or hair. The amount of\npigment in the iris varies; some individuals have reddish eyes,\nbut most have blue.\nHyperpigmentation can be due to excess of the pituitary\nhormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), as in adrenal\ninsuf \ufb01ciency (or the very rare condition Nelson \u2019s syndrome, in\nwhich there is ACTH overproduction following bilateral adre-\nnalectomy for pituitary Cushing \u2019s disease). Excess ACTH pro-\nduces brown pigmentation, particularly in skin creases, recent\nscars, sites overlying bony prominences, areas exposed to\npressure, such as belts and bra straps, and the mucous\nmembranes of the lips and mouth, where it results in muddy\nbrown patches (see Fig 10.9B , p. 229). Pregnancy and oral\ncontraceptives may also cause blotchy hyperpigmentation on\nthe face, known as chloasma, and pregnancy may increase\npigmentation of the areolae, axillae, genital skin and linea alba\n(producing a dark line in the midline of the lower abdomen,\ncalled a \u2018linea nigra \u2019).\nHaemochromatosis\nThis inherited condition of excessive iron absorption results in\nskin hyperpigmentation due to iron deposition and increased\nmelanin production ( Fig. 3.11 ).

Ayellowish discolouration is seen on the face, palms and soles but\nnot the sclera or conjunctiva, and this distinguishes it from\njaundice ( Fig. 3.13 ).\nDiscolouration\nSkin discolouration can also occur due to abnormal pigments,\nsuch as the sallow yellow-brownish tinge in chronic kidney dis-ease. A bluish tinge is produced by abnormal haemoglobins,\nsuch as sulphaemoglobin or methaemoglobin (see the section\non cyanosis later), or by drugs, such as dapsone. Some drug\nmetabolites cause strikingly abnormal colouration of the skin,\nparticularly in areas exposed to light: for example, mepacrine\n(yellow), amiodarone (bluish-grey), clofazimine (brownish-black)\nand phenothiazines (slate-grey; Fig. 3.14 ).\nJaundice\nJaundice is an abnormal yellow discoloration of the skin, sclera\nand mucous membranes. It is usually detectable when serum\nbilirubin concentration rises above 50 mmol/L (3 mg/dL) as a\nresult of parenchymal liver disease, biliary obstruction or hae-\nmolysis (see Fig. 6.8 , p. 115).\nPallor\nPallor can result from anaemia, in which there is a reduction in\ncirculating oxyhaemoglobin in the dermal and subconjunctival\ncapillaries, or from vasoconstriction due to cold exposure or\nsympathetic activation. The best sites to assess for the pallor of\nanaemia are the conjunctiva (speci \ufb01cally the anterior rim;\nFig. 3.15 ), the palmar skin creases and the face, in general,\nalthough absence of pallor does not exclude anaemia. Nail-bed\npallor lacks diagnostic value for predicting anaemia. In signi \ufb01-\ncant iron de \ufb01ciency anaemia, there may be additional \ufb01ndings of\nangular stomatitis, glossitis ( Fig. 3.16 ), koilonychia (spoon-\nshaped nails) and blue sclerae.\nFig. 3.11 Haemochromatosis with increased skin pigmentation.\nFig. 3.12 Erythema ab igne.\nFig. 3.13 Hypercarotenaemia.

Loss of\nheight is part of normal ageing but is accentuated by compres-\nsion fractures of the spine due to osteoporosis, particularly in\nwomen. In postmenopausal women, loss of >5 cm height is an\nindication to investigate for osteoporosis.\nTall stature\nTall stature is less common than short stature and is usually\nfamilial. Most individuals with heights above the 95th centile are\nnot abnormal, so ask about the height of close relatives.\nPathological causes of increased height include Marfan \u2019ss y n -\ndrome, prepubertal hypogonadism and gigantism. In Marfan \u2019ssyndrome, the limbs are long in relation to the length of the\ntrunk, and the arm span exceeds height ( Fig. 3.21A ). Additional\nfeatures include long, slender \ufb01ngers (arachnodactyly;\nFig. 3.21B ), narrow feet, a high-arched palate ( Fig. 3.21C ),\nupward dislocation of the lenses of the eyes ( Fig. 3.21D ), car-\ndiovascular abnormalities, such as mitral valve prolapse, and\ndilatation of the aortic root with aortic regurgitation.\nDuring puberty, the epiphyses close in response to stimulation\nfrom the sex hormones, so, in some patients with hypogonad-\nism, the limbs continue to grow for longer than usual (as in Kli-\nnefelter \u2019s syndrome).

            "Text": "Localised oedema\nLocalised oedema (an excess of interstitial \ufb02uid) is most\ncommonly caused by venous disease but may also develop in\nlymphatic, in \ufb02ammatory or allergic disorders.\nVenous causes\nIncreased venous pressure raises hydrostatic pressure within\ncapillaries, producing oedema in the area drained by that vein.\nVenous causes include deep vein thrombosis, external pressure\nfrom a tumour or pregnancy, or venous valvular incompetence\nfrom previous thrombosis or surgery ( Fig. 3.22 ). Conditions that\nimpair the normal muscle pumping action, such as hemiparesis\nand forced immobility, increase venous pressure by impairing\nvenous return. As a result, oedema may occur in immobile, bed-\nridden patients, in a paralysed limb, or in a healthy person sitting\nfor long periods, such as during travel.\nLymphatic causes\nNormally, interstitial \ufb02uid returns to the central circulation via the\nlymphatic system. Any obstruction to lymphatic \ufb02ow may pro-\nduce localised oedema (lymphoedema; Fig. 3.23 ). If the condi-\ntion persists, \ufb01brous tissue proliferates in the interstitial space,\nand the affected area becomes hard and no longer pits on\npressure. In the UK, the most common cause of chronic leg\nlymphoedema is congenital hypoplasia of leg lymphatics (Milroy \u2019s\ndisease); in the arm, lymphoedema usually follows radical mas-\ntectomy and/or irradiation for breast cancer. Lymphoedema is\ncommon in some tropical countries because of lymphatic\nobstruction by \ufb01larial worms (elephantiasis).In\ufb02ammatory causes\nAny cause of tissue in \ufb02ammation, including infection or injury,\nliberates mediators, such as histamine, bradykinin and cytokines,\nwhich cause vasodilatation and increase capillary permeability.\nIn\ufb02ammatory oedema is accompanied by the other features of\nin\ufb02ammation (redness, tenderness and warmth) and is, therefore,\npainful.\nAllergic causes\nIncreased capillary permeability occurs in acute allergic condi-\ntions, for example, an insect bite in an allergic individual. The\naffected area is usually red and pruritic (itchy) because of local\nrelease of histamine and other in \ufb02ammatory mediators but, in\ncontrast to in \ufb02ammation, is not painful.\nAngio-oedema is a severe form of allergic oedema affecting the\nface, lips and mouth, most commonly caused by insect bites, food\nallergy or drug reactions ( Fig. 3.24 ). Swelling may develop rapidly\nand become life-threatening if the upper airway is involved.\nLumps and lymph nodes\nPatients often present with a lump or enlarged lymph nodes\n(lymphadenopathy), which, while usually benign, can herald a\nserious underlying infective or malignant process. Alternatively,\nwhen examining a patient you may \ufb01nd a lump of which they\nwere unaware.\nLumps\nAsk about the rapidity of onset of the lump and the presence of\nany associated pain, tenderness, or colour change.

Multiple lumps may occur in\nneuro \ufb01bromatosis (see Fig. 3.20 ), skin metastases, lipomatosis\nand lymphomas.\nAttachment\nMalignant masses commonly in \ufb01ltrate adjacent tissues, causing\nthem to feel \ufb01xed and immobile.\nLymphatic obstruction may cause skin swelling with \ufb01ne\ndimpling where the skin is tethered by hair follicles, giving it an\n\u2018orange peel \u2019appearance ( peau d \u2019orange ;Fig. 11.6 , p. 242).\nThis is common in malignant disease when attachment to deeper\nstructures, such as underlying muscle, may also occur.\nConsistency\nThe consistency of a lump can vary from soft to \u2018stony \u2019hard.\nVery hard swellings are usually malignant, calci \ufb01ed or dense\n\ufb01brous tissue. Fluctuation occurs in the presence of \ufb02uid, as in an\nabscess, cyst, or blister ( Fig. 3.25 ), or in soft, encapsulated tu-\nmours, such as lipoma.\nEdge\nThe margin may be well delineated or ill de \ufb01ned, regular or\nirregular, and sharp or rounded. The margins of enlarged organs,\nsuch as the thyroid gland, liver, spleen, or kidney, can usually be\nde\ufb01ned more clearly than those of in \ufb02ammatory or malignant\nmasses. An inde \ufb01nite margin suggests in \ufb01ltrating malignancy, in\ncontrast to the clearly de \ufb01ned edge of a benign tumour.Surface and shape\nThe surface and shape of a swelling can be characteristic. In the\nabdomen, examples include an enlarged spleen or liver, a dis-\ntended bladder, or the uterine fundus in pregnancy. The surface\nmay be smooth or irregular: for example, the surface of the liver\nis smooth in acute hepatitis but is often nodular in metastatic\ndisease.\nPulsations, thrills and bruits\nArterial swellings (aneurysms) and highly vascular tumours arepulsatile, expanding in time with the arterial pulse. Other\nswellings may transmit pulsation if they lie over a major artery.\nIf the blood \ufb02ow through a lump is increased, a systolic\nmurmur (bruit) may be auscultated; occasionally, with suf \ufb01-\ncient \ufb02ow, a thrill may be palpable. Bruits are also heard over\narterial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations due to\nturbulent \ufb02ow.\nIn\ufb02ammation\nRedness, tenderness and warmth suggest in \ufb02ammation:\n\u0081Redness (erythema): the skin over acute in \ufb02ammatory lesions\nis usually red due to vasodilatation. In haematomas, the\npigment from extravasated blood may produce the range of\ncolours in a bruise (ecchymosis).\n\u0081Tenderness: in \ufb02ammatory lumps, such as boils or abscesses,\nare usually tender or painful, while non-in \ufb02amed swellings,\nsuch as lipomas, skin metastases and neuro \ufb01bromas, are\ncharacteristically painless.\n\u0081Warmth: in \ufb02ammatory lumps and some tumours, especially\nif rapidly growing, may feel warm due to increased blood\n\ufb02ow.\nTransillumination\nIn a darkened room, press the lighted end of a pen torch onto\none side of the swelling. A cystic swelling, such as a testicular\nhydrocoele, will light up if the \ufb02uid is translucent, providing the\ncovering tissues are not too thick (see Fig. 15.9 ,p .3 4 9 ) .\nFig. 3.24 Angio-oedema following a wasp sting.\nFig. 3.25 Blister on a leg.Lumps and lymph nodes \u008135\n3"

The right heart\n(right atrium and ventricle) pumps deoxygenated blood returning\nfrom the systemic veins into the pulmonary circulation at relatively\nlow pressures. The left heart (left atrium and ventricle) receives\nblood from the lungs and pumps it round the body to the tissues\nat higher pressures ( Fig. 4.2 ). Atrioventricular valves (tricuspid on\nthe right side, mitral on the left) separate the atria from theventricles. The pulmonary valve on the right side of the heart and\nthe aortic valve on the left separate the ventricles from the pul-\nmonary and systemic arterial systems, respectively. Cardiac\ncontraction is coordinated by specialised groups of cells. The\ncells in the sinoatrial node normally act as the cardiac pace-\nmaker. Subsequent spread of impulses through the heart en-\nsures that atrial contraction is complete before ventricular\ncontraction (systole) begins.

            "Text": "Chest pain\nIntermittent chest pain\nChest pain due to intermittent myocardial ischaemia (angina\npectoris) is typically a dull discomfort, often described as a tight\nor pressing \u2018band-like \u2019sensation akin to a heavy weight. It tends\nto be felt diffusely across the anterior chest and may radiate\ndown one or both arms and into the throat, jaw or teeth. In stable\nangina (caused by chronic narrowing in one or more coronary\narteries), episodes of pain are precipitated by exertion and may\noccur more readily when walking in cold or windy weather, after\na large meal or while carrying a heavy load; the pain is promptlyrelieved by rest and/or sublingual glyceryl nitrate (GTN) spray,\nand typically lasts for less than 10 minutes. The degree of\nphysical exertion required to precipitate symptoms is a better\nguide to disease severity than the intensity of discomfort\n(Box 4.2 ). Chest pain can be classi \ufb01ed into typical angina,\natypical angina and non-anginal chest pain ( Box 4.3 ). A history of\ntypical angina signi \ufb01cantly increases the likelihood of obstructive\ncoronary heart disease. In unstable angina (caused by a sudden\nsevere narrowing in a coronary artery), there is usually an abrupt\nonset or a worsening of chest pain episode that may occur on\nminimal exertion or at rest. It may be dif \ufb01cult to distinguish be-\ntween angina and non-cardiac causes of episodic chest pain,\nsuch as oesophageal pain or musculoskeletal problems\n(Box 4.4 ). The latter may occur at any site over the chest, often\nvary with posture or speci \ufb01c movements (such as twisting or\nturning) and may be associated with tenderness to palpation.\nAsk about:\n\u0081site, onset, severity and character of the pain, and whether\nthe pain radiates anywhere\n\u0081associated symptoms such as breathlessness\n\u0081aggravating and relieving factors, especially their relationship\nto exertion\n\u0081frequency and duration of symptoms, and any recent change\nin pattern\n\u0081degree of limitation caused by symptoms.Acute chest pain\nMyocardial infarction causes symptoms that are similar to, but\nmore severe and prolonged than, those of angina pectoris.\nAssociated features include restlessness, breathlessness and a\nfeeling of impending death ( angor animi ). Radiation to one or\nboth arms/shoulders, an association with exertion, sweating,\nnausea or vomiting and similarity to previous myocardial infarc-\ntion all increase the likelihood of acute myocardial infarction. Pain\nthat is pleuritic, positional, sharp, or reproduced with palpation is\nunlikely to be due to myocardial infarction.\nPericardial pain is typically a constant anterior central chest\npain that may radiate to the shoulders. It tends to be sharp or\nstabbing in character, exacerbated by inspiration or lying down,\nand relieved by sitting forwards. It is caused by in \ufb02ammation of\nthe pericardium secondary to viral infection, connective tissue\ndisease or myocardial infarction, or after surgery, catheter abla-\ntion or radiotherapy.\nAortic dissection (a tear in the intima of the thoracic aorta) is a life-\nthreatening condition which is often missed. It is associated with\nabrupt onset of very severe, tearing chest pain that can radiate to\nthe back (typically the interscapular region) and may be associated\nwith profound autonomic stimulation. Over 90% of patients report\nthe pain as severe or their \u2018worst ever \u2019, and the onset is sudden in\n85% of cases; the absence of abrupt onset makes the diagnosis\nless likely. If the tear involves the cranial or upper limb arteries, there\nmay be associated syncope, stroke or upper limb pulse asymme-\ntry. Predisposing factors include connective tissue disorders, such\nas Marfan \u2019ss y n d r o m e( s e e Fig. 3.21A \u2013D), family history of aortic\ndisease, known aortic valve disease, previous aortic manipulation\nand known thoracic aortic aneurysm.\nAs with intermittent chest pain, explore the characteristics of\nthe pain, and ask speci \ufb01cally about associated symptoms that4.2Canadian Cardiovascular Society: functional\nclassi \ufb01cation of stable angina\nGrade Description\n1 Ordinary physical activity, such as walking and climbing stairs,\ndoes not cause angina.

The severity can be graded by the number of pillows\nused at night: \u2018three-pillow orthopnoea \u2019, for example. Parox-\nysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is caused by the same mechanism,\nresulting in sudden breathlessness that wakes the patient from\nsleep ( Fig. 4.3 ).

Ventricular tachycardia can produce\nsimilar symptoms but is more commonly associated with pre-\nsyncope or syncope, and tends to affect patients with cardio-\nmyopathy or previous myocardial infarction.\nHigh-risk features that increase the likelihood of a life-\nthreatening arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia include:\n\u0081previous myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery\n\u0081associated syncope or severe chest pain\n\u0081family history of sudden death\n\u0081Wolff \u2013Parkinson \u2013White syndrome\n\u0081signi \ufb01cant structural heart disease such as hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis.\nSyncope and presyncope\nSyncope is a transient loss of consciousness due to transientcerebral hypoperfusion and episodes are typically characterised\nby rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete re-\ncovery. Causes include postural hypotension, neurocardiogenic\nsyncope, arrhythmias and mechanical obstruction to cardiac\noutput. The same mechanisms may lead to a sensation of\nlightheadedness and impending loss of consciousness without\nprogressing to actual loss of consciousness (presyncope). Themain differential diagnosis of syncope is seizure (p. 136), while\nlightheadedness and presyncope must be distinguished from\ndizziness or vertigo due to non-cardiovascular causes (p. 44).\nIn patients who present with syncope, ask about:\u0081circumstances of the event and any preceding symptoms:\npalpitation, chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea, tinnitus,\nsweating or visual disturbance\n\u0081duration of loss of consciousness, appearance of the patient\nwhile unconscious and any injuries sustained (a detailed\nwitness history is extremely helpful)\n\u0081time to recovery of full consciousness and normal cognition\n\u0081current driving status, including occupational driving.\nIn patients with presyncopal symptoms of lightheadedness or\ndizziness, ask about:\n\u0081exact nature of symptoms and associated features such as\npalpitation\n\u0081precipitants for symptoms, such as postural change, pro-\nlonged standing, intense emotion or exertion\n\u0081frequency of episodes and impact on lifestyle\n\u0081possible contributing medications, such as antihypertensive\nagents ( Box 4.8 ).\nPostural hypotension, a fall of more than 20 mmHg in systolic\nblood pressure on standing, may lead to syncope or pre-\nsyncope.

Longer diastolic intervals are\nassociated with increased stroke volume, which is re \ufb02ected by\nincreased pulse volume on examination. Abnormalities of pulsevolume and character are highly subjective, however, and tend to\nhave poor inter-observer agreement.\nA large pulse volume is a re \ufb02ection of a large pulse pressure,\nwhich can occur in physiological states such as exercise or\npregnancy, or in pathological conditions such as anaemia,\nthyrotoxicosis or aortic regurgitation.\nLow pulse volume may result from severe heart failure and\nconditions associated with inadequate ventricular \ufb01lling such as\nhypovolaemia, cardiac tamponade and mitral stenosis. Asym-\nmetric pulses may represent occlusive PAD or stenosis and,\nrarely, aortic dissection. Coarctation is a congenital narrowing of\nthe aorta, usually distal to the left subclavian artery ( Fig. 4.9 ); it\nmay produce reduced-volume lower limb pulses, which are also\ndelayed relative to the upper limb pulses (radiofemoral delay). In\nadults, coarctation usually presents with hypertension and heart\nfailure.\nA slow-rising pulse has a gradual upstroke with a reduced\npeak occurring late in systole, and is a feature of severe aortic\nstenosis ( Fig. 4.10 ).\nA collapsing pulse may occur with severe aortic regurgitation.\nThe peak of the pulse wave arrives early and is followed by a\nrapid fall in pressure (see Fig. 4.10 ) as blood \ufb02ows back into the\nleft ventricle, resulting in a wide pulse pressure (systolic \u00c0dia-\nstolic blood pressure >80 mmHg). This rapid fall imparts the\n\u2018collapsing \u2019sensation, and is exaggerated by raising the patient \u2019s\narm above the level of the heart (see Fig. 4.7B ).\nPulsus bisferiens, an increased pulse with a double systolic\npeak separated by a distinct mid-systolic dip, is classically pro-\nduced by concomitant aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Pulsus\nalternans, beat-to-beat variation in pulse volume with a normal\nrhythm, may occur in advanced heart failure.

This\nvariability is exaggerated when ventricular diastolic \ufb01lling is\nimpeded by elevated intrapericardial pressure. This is usually due\nto accumulation of pericardial \ufb02uid (cardiac tamponade;\nFig. 4.11 ) but can occur to a lesser extent with pericardial\nconstriction and in acute severe asthma. If suspected, pulsus\nparadoxus can be con \ufb01rmed using a blood pressure (BP) cuff\n(see later and Fig. 4.12 ); a fall of greater than 10 mmHg between\nthe cuff pressure at which Korotkoff sounds appear in expiration\nonly and the cuff pressure at which Korotkoff sounds persist\nthroughout the respiratory cycle is diagnostic.\nBlood pressure\nBP is a measure of the pressure that the circulating blood exerts\nagainst the arterial walls. Systolic pressure is the maximal pres-sure that occurs during ventricular contraction (systole). During\nventricular \ufb01lling (diastole), arterial pressure is maintained at a\nlower level by the elasticity and compliance of the vessel wall.\nThe lowest value (diastolic pressure) occurs immediately before\nthe next cycle.\nBP is usually measured using a sphygmomanometer (see\nFig. 4.12 ). In certain situations, such as the intensive care unit, itis measured invasively using an indwelling intra-arterial catheter\nconnected to a pressure sensor.\nBP is measured in mmHg and recorded as systolic pressure/\ndiastolic pressure, together with a note of where and how the\nreading was taken: for example, BP 146/92 mmHg, right arm,\nsupine.\nBP provides vital information on the haemodynamic condition\nof acutely ill or injured patients. Over the longer term it is also animportant guide to cardiovascular risk. BP constantly varies and\nrises with stress, excitement and environment. \u2018White coat hy-\npertension \u2019refers to a transient increase in BP caused by the\nstress of being in a healthcare setting.

If muf \ufb02ed sounds\npersist (phase 4) and do not disappear, use the point ofmuf\ufb02ing as the diastolic pressure.\nCommon problems in blood pressure (bp)\nmeasurement\n\u0081Different BP in each arm: a difference of greater than\n10 mmHg on repeated measurements suggests the pres-\nence of aortic or subclavian artery disease. Record the\nhighest pressure and use this to guide management.\n\u0081Wrong cuff size: the bladder should be approximately 80% of\nthe length and 40% of the width of the upper arm circum-\nference. A standard adult cuff has a bladder that measures\napproximately 13 \u00c230 cm and suits an arm circumference of\n22\u201326 cm. In obese patients a standard adult cuff will over-\nestimate BP, so use a large adult (bladder 16 \u00c238 cm) or\nthigh cuff (20 \u00c242 cm).\n\u0081Auscultatory gap: up to 20% of elderly hypertensive patients\nhave Korotkoff sounds that appear at systolic pressure and\ndisappear for an interval between systolic and diastolic\npressure. If the \ufb01rst appearance of the sound is missed, the\nsystolic pressure will be recorded at a falsely low level. Avoid\nthis by palpating the systolic pressure \ufb01rst.\n\u0081Patient \u2019s arm at the wrong level: the patient \u2019s elbow should\nbe level with the heart. Hydrostatic pressure causes a change\nof approximately 5 mmHg in recorded systolic and diastolic\nBP for a 7 cm change in arm elevation.\n\u0081Postural change: the pulse increases by about 11 bpm,\nsystolic BP falls by 3 \u20134 mmHg and diastolic BP rises by 5 \u2013\n6 mmHg when a healthy person stands. The BP stabilisesafter 1 \u20132 minutes. Check the BP after a patient has been\nstanding for 2 minutes; a drop of greater than 20 mmHg on\nstanding is postural hypotension.\n\u0081Atrial \ufb01brillation: in this condition, stroke volume and BP vary\nfrom beat to beat, making accurate measurement chal-\nlenging, so extra care is needed. Reducing cuff pressure\nslowly and repeating the measurement more than once will\nallow an acceptable average value of BP to be obtained.\nJugular venous pressure and waveform\nEstimate the jugular venous pressure (JVP) by observing the levelof pulsation in the internal jugular vein. The vein runs deep to the\nsternomastoid muscle and enters the thorax between the sternal\nand clavicular heads. The normal JVP waveform has two main\npeaks per cycle, which helps to distinguish it from the carotid\narterial pulse ( Box 4.14 ). Although the right internal jugular vein is\ntraditionally used, studies using the left internal jugular vein have\nyielded similarly accurate results. The external jugular vein is\nmore super \ufb01cial, prominent and easier to see. It can be kinked or\nobstructed as it traverses the deep fascia of the neck but, when\nvisible and pulsatile, can be used to estimate the JVP in dif \ufb01cult\ncases.\nThe JVP level re \ufb02ects right atrial pressure (normally <7 mmHg/\n9\u201310 cmH\n2O). If right atrial pressure is low, the patient may have\nto lie \ufb02at for the JVP to be seen; if high, the patient may need to\nsit upright ( Fig. 4.14 ).\nExamination sequence (Video 3E)\n\u0081Position the patient supine, reclined at 45 degrees, with the\nhead resting on a pillow and turned slightly to the left. The\njugular venous pressure (JVP) is seen best if the sternoclei-\ndomastoid muscles and overlying skin are relaxed, so ensurethe head is supported and avoid excessive head turning or\nelevation of the chin.\n\u0081Look across the patient \u2019s neck from the right side\n(Fig. 4.15A ).

If that is the case, the\nfollowing may help:\n\u0081Abdominojugular test: press \ufb01rmly over the abdomen. This\nincreases venous return to the right side of the heart\ntemporarily and the JVP normally rises.\n\u0081Changes with respiration: the JVP normally falls with inspi-\nration due to decreased intrathoracic pressure.\n\u0081Waveform: the normal JVP waveform has two distinct peaks\nper cardiac cycle (see Fig. 4.15C ):\n\u0081The \u2018a\u2019wave corresponds to right atrial contraction and\noccurs just before the \ufb01rst heart sound. In atrial \ufb01brillation\nthe \u2018a\u2019wave is absent.\n\u0081The \u2018v\u2019wave is caused by atrial \ufb01lling during ventricular\nsystole when the tricuspid valve is closed.\n\u0081Rarely, a third peak ( \u2018c\u2019wave) may be seen due to closure\nof the tricuspid valve.\n\u0081Occlusion: the JVP waveform is obliterated by gently\noccluding the vein at the base of the neck with your \ufb01nger.\n\u0081Changes with position: the JVP will vary with the position of\nthe patient (see Fig. 4.14 ).\nThe JVP provides a reasonably accurate guide to central\nvenous pressure, though it is better to estimate whether this is\nhigh, normal or low rather than attempting to measure a speci \ufb01c\nvalue. A JVP greater than 3 cm above the sternal angle strongly\nsuggests elevated central venous pressure which occurs in\nstates of volume overload (particularly heart failure). It is alsoelevated in any condition that leads to high right ventricular \ufb01lling\npressures, such as pulmonary embolism, chronic pulmonary\nhypertension, cardiac tamponade (see Fig. 4.11 ) or pericardial\nconstriction ( Box 4.15 ).\nIn patients presenting with dyspnoea, an elevated JVP is a\nvery valuable sign for diagnosing heart failure; examine the pa-\ntient for pulmonary oedema or pleural effusions (p. 85), ascites(p. 123) and/or peripheral oedema (p. 280).\nMechanical obstruction of the superior vena cava (most often\ncaused by lung cancer) may cause extreme, non-pulsatile\nelevation of the JVP. In this case the JVP no longer re \ufb02ects\nright atrial pressure and the abdominojugular test will be\nnegative.\nKussmaul \u2019s sign is a paradoxical rise of JVP on inspiration that\nis seen in pericardial constriction, severe right ventricular failure\nand restrictive cardiomyopathy.\nProminent \u2018a\u2019waves are caused by delayed or restricted right\nventricular \ufb01lling, as in pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid\nstenosis.\nCannon waves (giant \u2018a\u2019waves) occur when the right atrium\ncontracts against a closed tricuspid valve. Irregular cannon\nwaves are seen in complete heart block and are due to atrio-\nventricular dissociation. Regular cannon waves occur during\njunctional rhythm and with some ventricular and supraventricular\ntachycardias.\nTricuspid regurgitation results in prominent systolic \u2018v\u2019waves,\nwhich can fuse with the \u2018c\u2019waves to produce \u2018cv\u2019waves; there\nmay be an associated pulsatile liver.\nPrecordium\nThe precordium is the anterior chest surface overlying the heartand great vessels.\nLearn the surface anatomy and basic physiology of the heart\nto understand the basis and timing of the heart sounds and\nmurmurs, and why they are heard best in different locations and\nradiate in a particular direction ( Fig. 4.16 ).Jugular\nvenouspressure\nA BC\nFig. 4.14 Jugular venous pressure in a healthy subject.

A left submammary scar is usually the result of\nmitral valvotomy or transapical-transcatheter aortic-valve im-\nplantation. Infraclavicular scars are seen after pacemaker or\nde\ufb01brillator implantation, and the bulge of the device may be\nobvious in this position.\nA normal apical impulse brie \ufb02y lifts your \ufb01ngers and is local-\nised, but it may be impalpable, particularly in overweight or\nmuscular people, or in patients with hyperin \ufb02ated lungs due to\nobstructive airways disease (see Fig. 5.4 ).The apex beat is normally in the \ufb01fth left intercostal space at, or\njust medial to, the mid-clavicular line (see Fig. 4.16 ). It may be\ndisplaced laterally, to the anterior or mid-axillary line, or inferiorly\nto the sixth or seventh intercostal space when the left ventricle is\ndilated e.g. in patients with heart failure or severe aortic regur-\ngitation. When detected, a displaced apex beat is one of the\nmost helpful clinical signs for identifying patients with left ven-\ntricular systolic dysfunction, although it is important to note that anon-displaced apex beat does not help to rule out heart disease.\nIn dextrocardia the cardiac apex is palpable on the right side but\nthis condition is uncommon, with a prevalence of 1:10,000.\nA sustained and forceful but undisplaced apical impulse,\nknown as an apical \u2018heave \u2019is sometimes detected in patients\nwith left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension or severe\naortic stenosis, whilst a diffuse and less forceful impulse is more\ncharacteristic of left ventricular dilatation. Pulsation over the left\nparasternal area (right ventricular heave) indicates right ventric-\nular hypertrophy or dilatation, most often accompanying pul-\nmonary hypertension. The \u2018tapping \u2019apex beat in mitral stenosis\nrepresents a palpable \ufb01rst heart sound and is not usually\ndisplaced.\nThe most common thrill is that of aortic stenosis, which is\nusually palpable over the upper right sternal border. The thrill\ncaused by a ventricular septal defect is best felt at the left and\nright sternal edges. Diastolic thrills are very rare.\nAuscultation\nUse auscultation to identify and characterise the heart soundsand any added sounds and/or murmurs. The optimal sites for\nauscultation do not correspond with the location of cardiac\nstructures but are where the transmitted sounds and murmurs\nare best heard ( Box 4.16 ).\nThe diaphragm accentuates high-frequency sounds and is\nbetter for hearing normal heart sounds and high-pitched sounds,\nsuch as the early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The bell\nis better for hearing low pitched sounds, particularly the diastolic\nmurmur of mitral stenosis and third and fourth heart sounds.\nFig. 4.17 Palpating the heart.

It is best\nheard at the apex. In mitral stenosis the intensity of S 1is\nincreased due to elevated left atrial pressure ( Box 4.18 ).\nSecond heart sound\nThe second heart sound (S 2),\u2018dub \u2019, is caused by closure of the\npulmonary and aortic valves at the end of ventricular systole and\nis best heard at the left sternal edge. It is louder and higher-\npitched than the S 1\u2018lub\u2019, and the aortic component is normally\nlouder than the pulmonary component.\nPhysiological splitting of S 2occurs because left ventricular\ncontraction ends slightly before that of the right ventricle so that\nthe aortic valve closes before the pulmonary valve. This splitting\nincreases on inspiration ( \u2018lub d-dub \u2019) because increased venous\n\ufb01lling of the right ventricle further delays pulmonary valve closure.\nThe separation disappears on expiration ( \u2018lub dub \u2019;Fig. 4.19 ).Wide splitting of S 2, but with normal respiratory variation, oc-\ncurs in conditions that delay right ventricular emptying, such as\nright bundle branch block or pulmonary hypertension. Wide and\n\ufb01xed splitting of S 2, with no variation in respiration, is almost\nalways due to an atrial septal defect ( Fig. 4.20 ).

A loud pulmonary component of S 2is an\nimportant sign of pulmonary hypertension.\nThird heart sound\nThe third heart sound (S 3) is a low-pitched early diastolic sound\nbest heard with the bell at the apex. It results from a brief period\nof rapid ventricular \ufb01lling immediately after opening of the atrio-\nventricular valves and is therefore heard after the second heart\nsound as \u2018lub dub-dum \u2019. It may be a normal physiological \ufb01nding\nin children and young adults or during fever or pregnancy.\nHowever, after the age of 40 years, it is usually due to left ven-\ntricular failure or mitral regurgitation, with the rapid ventricular\n\ufb01lling a consequence of high left atrial pressure at the onset of\ndiastole. In patients presenting to hospital with acute breath-\nlessness, the presence of an S 3, on examination, strongly in-\ncreases the likelihood of heart failure but its absence does not\nhelp to rule out heart failure. In the context of heart failure, S 3is\ntypically accompanied by a tachycardia and referred to as a\n\u2018gallop \u2019rhythm.\nFourth heart sound\nA fourth heart sound (S 4) is less common than an S 3and less\nuseful in modern clinical practice. It is soft and low-pitched, best\nheard with the bell at the apex. It occurs just before S 1(da-lub-\ndub). It is caused by forceful atrial contraction against a non-\ncompliant or stiff ventricle, most often with left ventricular hy-\npertrophy due to hypertension, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy. It cannot occur when there is atrial \ufb01brillation.\nAdditional sounds\nAn opening snap is commonly heard in mitral (rarely, tricuspid)\nstenosis.

            "Text": "patients with congenital pulmonary or aortic stenosis (see\nFig. 4.21B ). The mechanism is similar to that of an opening snap.\nEjection clicks do not occur in calci \ufb01c aortic stenosis because the\ncusps are rigid.\nMid-systolic clicks are high-pitched and best heard at the apex\nwith the diaphragm. They occur in mitral valve prolapse (see\nFig. 4.21C ) where they are often associated with a late systolic\nmurmur.\nA pericardial (friction) rub is a coarse scratching sound that is\ntypically biphasic, with both systolic and diastolic components. It\nis best heard using the diaphragm with the patient holding their\nbreath in expiration. It may be audible over any part of the pre-\ncordium but is often localised, varying in intensity over time and\nwith the position of the patient. It is highly speci \ufb01c for pericarditis\nand present in 35 \u201385% of cases. It is an important sign in\ncontemporary practice because it is one of four criteria (along\nwith characteristic chest pain, suggestive electrocardiogram\n(ECG) changes and new or worsening pericardial effusion) used\nto diagnose acute pericarditis; at least two of the four criteria\nneed to be present.\nProsthetic valve sounds\nMechanical heart valves can make a sound when they close or\nopen. The closure sound is normally louder, especially with\nmodern valves. The sounds are high-pitched, with a \u2018metallic \u2019\nquality, are often heard without a stethoscope, and may even be\npalpable. A mechanical mitral valve replacement makes a metallic\nS1and a sound like a loud opening snap early in diastole (see\nFig. 4.21D ). Mechanical aortic valves have a loud, metallic S 2and\nan opening sound like an ejection click at the start of systole (seeFig. 4.21E ); they are normally associated with a \ufb02ow murmur.\nHeart sounds arising from bioprosthetic valves usually sound\nsimilar to those of normal valves.\nMurmurs\nHeart murmurs are produced by increased velocity of \ufb02ow\nthrough a normal valve or by turbulent \ufb02ow across an abnormal\nvalve, septal defect or out \ufb02ow obstruction.\nSystolic murmurs\nCauses of systolic murmurs are shown in Box 4.19 .\n\u2018Innocent \u2019murmurs occur when stroke volume is increased,\nas in pregnant women, athletes with resting bradycardia or pa-\ntients with fever or anaemia. They tend to be low in intensity\n(grade 2), short in duration and best heard at the left sternal edgewith no radiation.\nThe murmur of aortic stenosis is often audible all over the\nprecordium with radiation to the suprasternal notch and carotid\narteries ( Fig. 4.22 ). It is a harsh, ejection systolic murmur that is\nusually loud and there may be a thrill. The absence of an ejection\nsystolic murmur makes clinically signi \ufb01cant aortic stenosis\nextremely unlikely. In the presence of an ejection systolic\nmurmur, several clinical signs support the diagnosis (see\nFig. 4.22 ) and moderate to severe stenosis is highly likely if three\nor more of these are present.\nAortic sclerosis (thickening and calci \ufb01cation of the aortic valve\nwithout obstruction) produces a similar quality of murmur but it isless likely to radiate and is not associated with a thrill or other\nsigns of aortic stenosis.\nMitral regurgitation is the most common cause of a pansystolic\nmurmur and tends to have a \u2018blowing \u2019quality. The most helpful\nfeature in distinguishing it from other causes is its location\n(Fig. 4.23 ): a murmur that extends from the apex to the anterior\naxillary line \u2013but is only audible below the third intercostal space\n\u2013strongly suggests mitral regurgitation. With mitral valve pro-\nlapse, regurgitation begins in mid-systole, producing a late sys-\ntolic murmur (see Fig. 4.23 ).\nThe murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is another common\ncause of a pansystolic murmur. Localisation to the lower left\nsternal edge (only audible below the third intercostal space or\nlateral to the mid-clavicular line ( Fig. 4.24 ), strongly supports the\ndiagnosis, as does an increase in its intensity with inspiration,\nwhich increases blood \ufb02ow through the right heart. Notably, the\nabsence of a murmur does not exclude tricuspid regurgitation.\nVentricular septal defects also cause a pansystolic murmur.\nSmall congenital defects produce a loud murmur audible at the\nleft sternal border, radiating to the right sternal border and often\nassociated with a thrill. Rupture of the interventricular septum\ncan complicate myocardial infarction, producing a harsh pan-\nsystolic murmur, typically accompanied by major haemodynamic\ncompromise.\nDiastolic murmurs\nThe murmur of aortic regurgitation ( Fig. 4.25 ) may last\nthroughout most, or even all of diastole, but is usually termed an\n\u2018early diastolic murmur \u2019because it is loudest in early diastole. It is\nbest heard at the left sternal edge with the patient leaning for-\nwards in held expiration.

Thyroid function should be\nassessed since thyroid disorders can cause or exacerbate most\ncardiac conditions. Urea and electrolytes are measured and liver\nfunction tests performed prior to starting therapies that may have\nimpact upon renal function or cause hepatotoxicity.\nBlood glucose and a lipid pro \ufb01le help identify patients with\ndiabetes mellitus and assess cardiovascular risk. In patients with\nacute chest pain, cardiac troponin is measured to determine\nwhether there is myocardial injury or infarction.\nElectrocardiography\nIn performing a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG;\nFig. 4.27 ), the patient must be resting supine and relaxed to\navoid muscle tremor. Good contact between the electrode and\nskin is important and it may be necessary to shave the chest.\nThe electrodes must be positioned correctly to obtain recordings\nmade from the six precordial electrodes (V 1\u2013V6) and six re-\ncordings from the limb electrodes (left arm, right arm and left leg).\nThe right leg electrode is used as a reference. Con \ufb01rm that the\nECG is calibrated using a 1 mV signal prior to recording. The\nECG plays an indispensable role in the diagnosis of acute cor-\nonary syndromes (most notably, ST segment-elevation\nmyocardial infarction; Fig 4.27C ), cardiac arrhythmias, acute\npericarditis and inherited heart conditions such as cardiomyop-\nathies or congenital long QT syndrome.\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring\nContinuous ECG recording over 24 \u201348 hours can be used to\nidentify symptomatic or asymptomatic rhythm disturbances inpatients with palpitation or syncope. If symptoms are less\nfrequent, it may be necessary to use patient-activated recordersthat record the heart rhythm only when the patient is symp-\ntomatic; the device is activated by the patient ( Fig. 4.28 ).\nExercise ECG\nAn exercise ECG is useful in the diagnosis and functional\nassessment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.\nDown-sloping ST segment depression, particularly when it oc-\ncurs during minor exertion, or ST segment elevation, is of\nprognostic signi \ufb01cance and helps inform the need for invasive\ninvestigation with coronary angiography.\nAmbulatory blood pressure monitoring\nA portable device can be worn by the patient at home that takes\nat least two BP measurements per hour. It is used to con \ufb01rm the\ndiagnosis of hypertension and provide a more reliable assess-\nment of response to treatment.\nChest X-ray\nThe maximum width of the heart divided by the maximum width\nof the thorax on a posteroanterior chest x-ray (the cardiothoracic\nratio) should normally be less than 0.5. An increased cardio-\nthoracic ratio is common in heart failure and some valvular le-\nsions. In the former this is often accompanied by distension of\nthe upper lobe pulmonary veins, diffuse shadowing within the\nlungs due to pulmonary oedema, and Kerley B lines (horizontal,\nengorged lymphatics at the periphery of the lower lobes;\nFig. 4.29A ). A widened mediastinum may indicate a thoracic\naortic aneurysm.\nEchocardiography\nEchocardiography uses high-frequency sound waves to eval-\nuate cardiac structure and function. It permits measurements of\nchamber size and wall thickness, assessment of regional and\nglobal ventricular systolic function and detection of abnormal\nvalve morphology or motion. In addition, Doppler echocardi-\nography, through visualisation of blood \ufb02ow and measurement\nof blood velocity, enables detection and quanti \ufb01cation of\nvalvular stenosis or regurgitation and other lesions such as\nintracardiac shunts. Most echocardiography scans are per-\nformed through the anterior chest wall (transthoracic;\nFig. 4.29B ). Transoesophageal echocardiography requires\nsedation but gives high resolution of posterior structures\nsuch as the left atrium, mitral valve and descending aorta,\nand is useful in detecting valvular vegetations in infective\nendocarditis.\nRadionuclide studies\nTechnetium-99 is injected intravenously and detected using a\ngamma camera to assess left ventricular function.

            "Text": "Cardiac catheterisation\nA\ufb01ne catheter is introduced under local anaesthetic via a pe-\nripheral artery (usually the radial or femoral) and advanced to the\nheart under x-ray guidance. Although measurements of intra-cardiac pressures, and therefore estimates of valvular and car-\ndiac function, are possible, the primary application of this\ntechnique is imaging of the coronary circulation using contrast\nmedium. This is performed to inform and guide revascularisation,\neither by coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting (see\nFig. 4.29C ).\nComputed tomography and magnetic\nresonance imaging\nComputed tomography (CT), combined with cardiac gating\npermits high resolution imaging of the coronary arteries including\ncoronary atheroma and calci \ufb01cation. CT is particularly useful for\nruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (and thereby\nangina) in patients with chest pain who are deemed to be at low\nto moderate risk of coronary disease. It can also reduce the need\nfor invasive investigation in patients with a low probability of\nocclusive coronary disease who require valve surgery. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI; Fig. 4.29D ) provides superior spatial\nresolution to echocardiography, together with an unrestricted\nviewing plane. It is the most accurate method of measuring\ncardiac volumes and ventricular ejection fraction and is the im-\naging modality of choice for investigating the aetiology of heart\nmuscle diseases (cardiomyopathy).\nPERIPHERAL ARTERIAL SYSTEM\nAnatomy and physiology\nSee Fig. 4.30 .\nThe history\nCommon presenting symptoms\nLeg pain\nAsymptomatic ischaemia\nPAD is recognised as a worldwide public health challenge with a\nconcerning increase in prevalence over recent decades in both\nhigh- and low- income countries. Studies from Scotland suggest\naround 5% of men and women over 55 years of age experience\nintermittent claudication and a further 25% had evidence of\nasymptomatic PAD. The underlying pathology is usually athero-\nsclerosis affecting large and medium-sized vessels. PAD affectsthe legs eight times more commonly than the arms. This is partly\nbecause the lower limb arteries are more frequently affected by\natherosclerosis, but also because the arterial supply to the legs is\nless well developed in relation to the muscle mass.

            "Text": "Whilst the risk of limb loss is low even in patients with inter-\nmittent claudication (1 \u20132% per year), PAD carries additional\nclinical importance because it has a very strong association with\ncoronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease. There is\nan elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in both\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic patients with PAD, and the\nmortality is double that of the age-matched population. Athero-\nsclerosis is a systemic disease, and it is therefore important thatpatients with PAD are identi \ufb01ed and treated similarly to those\npatients presenting with coronary and cerebrovascular events.\nRemember that many patients with PAD may be asymptom-\natic either because they choose not to walk very far, or because\ntheir exercise tolerance is limited by other comorbidities such as\ncardiac disease.\nIntermittent claudication\nIntermittent claudication is pain felt in the legs on walking due to\narterial insuf \ufb01ciency and is the most common symptom of PAD. It\nis important to distinguish claudication due to arterial insuf \ufb01ciency\nfrom other causes of lower limb pain, which include osteoarthritis,\nneurogenic claudication and venous claudication ( Box 4.21 ).\nPatients with intermittent claudication describe tightness or\n\u2018cramp-like \u2019pain that develops after a relatively constant distance;\nthe distance is often shorter if walking uphill. The pain disappears\ncompletely within a few minutes of rest but recurs on walking. The\n\u2018claudication distance \u2019is how far patients say they can walk before\nthe pain comes on. The \u2018total walking distance \u2019is how far they can\nwalk before the pain is so bad that they have to stop.The pain is felt in major muscle groups and its location de-\npends on the level at which the arteries are diseased. The calf\nmuscle is most commonly affected due to femoropopliteal dis-\nease, while pain in the thigh or buttock suggests common\nfemoral or aortoiliac obstruction. Male patients who have bilateral\ncommon iliac or internal iliac artery occlusion may develop Ler-\niche \u2019s syndrome, involving buttock claudication and erectile\ndysfunction.\nClaudication is not in itself limb-threatening, although it is a\nmarker for widespread atherosclerotic disease. With best med-\nical therapy and supervised exercise programmes, 50% will\nimprove, 30% will remain stable and only 20% will deteriorate\nfurther.\nAny intervention for claudication is performed purely for the\npurpose of symptomatic relief, since only a small minority of\npatient \u2019s progress to critical limb ischaemia. The patient \u2019s age,\noccupation and comorbidities are important in determining the\nextent to which claudication limits their lifestyle. A postal worker\nwho is only able to walk 100 metres is seriously limited, but an\nelderly person who simply wants to cross the road to the shops\nmay cope well. While absolute distances are important, it may be\nmore helpful to ask speci \ufb01c questions about how symptoms\naffect the patient \u2019s lifestyle:\n\u0081Can you walk to the clinic from the bus stop or car park\nwithout stopping?\n\u0081Can you do your own shopping?\n\u0081What are you unable to do because of the pain?\n4.21 The clinical features of arterial, neurogenic and venous claudication\nArterial Neurogenic Venous\nPathology Stenosis or occlusion of major lower limb\narteriesLumbar nerve root or cauda equina\ncompression (spinal stenosis)Obstruction to the venous out \ufb02ow of the leg due\nto iliofemoral venous occlusion\nSite of pain Muscles, usually the calf but may involve\nthigh and buttocksIll-de \ufb01ned\nWhole legMay be associated with numbnessand tinglingWhole leg\n\u2018Bursting \u2019in nature\nLaterality Unilateral or bilateral Often bilateral Nearly always unilateral\nOnset Gradual after walking the \u2018claudication\ndistance \u2019Often immediate on walking or\nstanding upGradual, from the moment walking starts\nRelieving features On stopping walking, the pain\ndisappears completely in 1 \u20132 minutesBending forwards and stopping\nwalkingPatient may sit down for full reliefLeg elevation\nColour Normal or pale Normal Cyanosed\nOften visible varicose veins\nTemperature Normal or cool Normal Normal or increasedOedema Absent Absent Always presentPulses Reduced or absent Normal Present but may be dif \ufb01cult to feel owing to\noedema\nStraight-leg\nraisingNormal May be limited NormalThe history \u008171\n4"

Night pain develops because on lying, the\nbene \ufb01cial effects of gravity on perfusion are lost, and in addition,\nheart rate, BP and cardiac output are reduced during sleep.Patients may \ufb01nd relief by hanging the leg out of bed or by\ngetting up and walking around. On return to bed, however, the\npain recurs and patients often choose to sleep in a chair. This\nleads to dependent oedema, increased interstitial tissue pres-\nsure, a further reduction in tissue perfusion and ultimately a\nworsening of the pain.\nRest pain\nRest pain occurs when blood \ufb02ow is insuf \ufb01cient to meet the\nmetabolic demands of the tissues, even at rest. Critical\nischaemia is de \ufb01ned as rest pain (persisting for more than\n2 weeks and requiring opiate analgesia) or tissue loss associated\nwith an ankle pressure of less than 50 mmHg or a toe pressure of\nless than 30 mmHg.\nRest or night pain indicates severe, multilevel, lower limb PAD\nand requires urgent referral to a vascular surgeon, as failure to\nrevascularise the leg usually leads to the development of tissue\nloss (gangrene, ulceration) and amputation.\nIn patients with diabetes it may be dif \ufb01cult to differentiate be-\ntween rest pain and diabetic neuropathy, as both may be worse\nat night. Neuropathic pain may not be con \ufb01ned to the foot, is\nassociated with burning and tingling, is not relieved by de-\npendency and is accompanied by dysaesthesia (pain or un-\ncomfortable sensations, sometimes described as burning,tingling or numbness). Many patients with neuropathy cannot\neven bear the pressure of bedclothes on their feet.\nTissue loss (ulceration and/or gangrene)\nIn patients with severe lower limb PAD, perfusion is inadequate\nto support the tissues, and areas of tissue loss (gangrene)\ndevelop at the tips of the digits, gradually spreading proximally.\nFurthermore, even trivial injuries do not heal and cause ulcera-\ntion. Tissue loss often progresses rapidly and, without revascu-\nlarisation, leads to amputation and/or death.\nTissue loss in the diabetic patient\nTissue loss in the diabetic patient (see p. 208) can progressrapidly and represent a surgical emergency, even if outward\nsigns are relatively few. There are often a number of factors at\nplay. These include poor perfusion at the major vessel and\nmicrocirculatory levels, sensory and motor neuropathy, loss of\nfoot architecture, concomitant renal dysfunction, increased\nsusceptibility to infection and even delayed identi \ufb01cation of the\nproblem due to visual and sensory impairment.\nAcute limb ischaemia\nThe classical features of acute limb ischaemia are the \u2018six Ps \u2019\n(Box 4.22 ). Pallor, pain, pulselessness and perishing cold are\nrelatively early signs. Paralysis (inability to move the toes/ \ufb01ngers)\nand paraesthesia (numbness or tingling over the forefoot or\ndorsum of the hand) are the most important and indicate severe\nischaemia affecting nerve and muscle function. Muscletenderness is a grave sign indicating actual or impending muscle\ninfarction. A limb with these features will usually become irre-\nversibly damaged unless the circulation is restored within a few\nhours.\nIt is important to consider the most likely underlying cause:\n\u0081Thromboembolism: usually from the left atrium in association\nwith atrial \ufb01brillation or myocardial infarction. There is usually\nno history of claudication.\n\u0081Thrombosis in situ: thrombotic occlusion of an already nar-\nrowed atherosclerotic arterial segment ( Box 4.23 ). In this\nsituation the patient is likely to have a past history of\nclaudication.\nReperfusion of the acutely ischaemic limb is time critical and\npatients often proceed to the operating theatre on the basis of\nhigh-quality clinical evaluation, without undergoing any further\ninvestigations.\nCompartment syndrome\nThe perfusion pressure of a muscle is the difference between themean arterial pressure and the pressure within the fascial\ncompartment within which it lies. Compartment syndrome oc-\ncurs where there is increased pressure within the fascial com-\npartments of the limb that compromises the perfusion and\nviability of muscle and nerves.

A high index of suspi-\ncion is required since failure to recognise and treat compartment\nsyndrome may result in limb amputation. The key symptom is\nsevere pain that is often unrelieved by opioids and exacerbated\nby active or passive movement. It is worth remembering\nthat peripheral pulses are usually present, since the majorarteries lie outside the fascial compartments and are not affected\nby increased compartment pressure. Compartment monitors\ncan be used as an adjunct to measure compartment\npressure with high or rising pressures indicating the need for\nfasciotomies.\nAbdominal pain\nMesenteric ischaemia\nBecause of the rich collateral circulation of the gut, usually two ofthe three major visceral arteries (coeliac trunk, superior andinferior mesenteric arteries) must be critically stenosed or\noccluded before symptoms and signs of chronic mesenteric\narterial insuf \ufb01ciency occur. Severe central abdominal pain\ntypically develops 10 \u201315 minutes after eating. The patient be-\ncomes scared of eating and signi \ufb01cant weight loss is a universal\n\ufb01nding. Diarrhoea may also be present and the non-speci \ufb01c\nnature of symptoms may result in misdiagnosis; the patient\nmay have had numerous investigations before the diagnosis is\nmade.\nAcute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency. It is most\ncommonly caused by an embolus from the heart or by throm-\nbosis in situ of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque in one of the\nmesenteric vessels. It is often hard to diagnose in the early\nstages, as patients typically present initially with severe abdom-\ninal pain that is out of proportion to often unimpressive\nabdominal signs. Presentation with severe abdominal pain,\nshock, bloody diarrhoea and profound metabolic acidosis in-\ndicates infarction of the bowel, which carries a high mortality rate.\nRarely, renal angle pain occurs from renal infarction or ischaemia,\nand is associated with visible or non-visible haematuria.\nAny patient suspected of having visceral ischaemia should\nundergo urgent CT angiography.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm\nAAA is an abnormal focal dilatation of the aorta to at least 150%of its normal diameter ( Fig. 4.31 ). It is often diagnosed incidentally\nduring a CT scan or alternative imaging for other reasons.\nPatients may present with abdominal and/or back pain, or\noccasionally with more subtle signs such as an awareness of\nabdominal pulsation or the observation of ripples in the water\nwhen they are in the bath (Richards \u2019wave sign). However, most\npatients are asymptomatic until the aneurysm ruptures.\nThe classical features of AAA rupture include abdominal/back\npain, pulsatile abdominal mass, syncope and shock (hypoten-\nsion), but these are not always present, and it is important to\nhave a low threshold of suspicion and consider early referral and/\nor CT imaging.Digital ischaemia\nBlue toes\nBlue toe syndrome occurs when there is atheroembolism froman AAA or alternative proximal embolic source (such as popliteal\naneurysm or atherosclerotic plaque).

It has three phases ( Fig. 4.32 ):\n\u0081pallor: due to digital artery spasm and/or obstruction\n\u0081cyanosis: due to deoxygenation of static venous blood (this\nphase may be absent)\n\u0081redness: due to reactive hyperaemia.\nRaynaud \u2019s phenomenon may be primary (Raynaud \u2019s disease)\nand caused by idiopathic digital artery vasospasm, or secondary\nto other conditions (Raynaud \u2019s syndrome) such as drugs, con-\nnective tissue disease, hyperviscosity syndromes or use of po-\nwer tools (vibration white \ufb01nger). While for most patients this is a\nself-limiting condition, a small minority develop tissue loss.\nPatients over 40 years old presenting with unilateral Raynaud \u2019s\nphenomenon should be investigated for underlying PAD,especially if they have cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes or a\nsmoking habit.\nStroke\nStroke is a focal neurological de \ufb01cit that has a vascular cause\nand is discussed on p. 137.\nPast medical history\nIs the patient known to have established peripheral vasculardisease?

Are there\nany other comorbidities (such as severe cardiac or lung disease)\nthat would make any potential operative intervention high-risk or\nfutile? Enquire about general health status since symptoms of\nvascular disease may be precipitated by another medical con-\ndition. For example, the new onset of rest pain may result from\npoor cardiac output or anaemia.\nDrug history\nEnquire about medication used for secondary prevention andadherence to these: antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive\nand diabetes therapies.

There is a strong familial association for AAAs so,\nwhere relevant, a family history should be sought.\nSocial history\nTake a smoking history (p. 16).

Duplex ultrasound is often the \ufb01rst-line investigation of\nchoice for unilateral disease, while bilateral symptoms can be\ninvestigated using a CT or MR angiogram ( Box 4.25 ).\nThere is an increasing use of bedside ultrasound to assess\npatients presenting acutely with PVD.\nPERIPHERAL VENOUS SYSTEM\nAnatomy and physiology\nBlood is returned to the heart from the peripheries by a network of\ndeep (90%) and super \ufb01cial (10%) veins. Venous return from the\nhead and neck is passive, while blood from the legs must be\npumped actively back up to the heart against gravity. Pressure on\nthe sole of the foot on walking, together with a contraction of\nmuscles in the calf (the \u2018calf muscle pump \u2019)a n d ,t oal e s s e re x t e n t ,\nin the thighs and buttocks, drives blood back up through the veins.\nBackward \ufb02ow (re \ufb02ux) is prevented by valves that divide the long\ncolumn of blood from the foot to the right atrium into a series of\nshort, low-pressure segments. As a result, the \u2018ambulatory venous\npressure \u2019in the feet in health is usually less than 20 mmHg.\nDeep veins follow the course of the main arteries. Valvular\ninsuf \ufb01ciency causing venous re \ufb02ux may be primary or post-\nthrombotic (following DVT). Following DVT, the vein may remain\noccluded or recanalised; however, even in recanalised veins\nvalve function is usually compromised. Post-thrombotic syn-drome results from deep venous incompetence due to either\nocclusion, valvular dysfunction or a combination. Symptoms\ninclude pain, venous claudication, blue discoloration, swelling,dilated super \ufb01cial veins, skin changes and ulceration; it can be\ndif\ufb01cult to treat.\nThe long and short saphenous veins are the super \ufb01cial veins of\nthe lower limb and may also be affected by primary valvular\nfailure and by valvular failure secondary to super \ufb01cial thrombo-\nphlebitis. The long (great) saphenous vein passes anterior to the\nmedial malleolus at the ankle, then up the medial aspect of the\ncalf and thigh to join the common femoral vein in the groin at the\nsaphenofemoral junction ( Fig. 4.35 ).\nThe short (lesser) saphenous vein passes behind the lateral\nmalleolus at the ankle and up the posterior aspect of the calf. It\ncommonly joins the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junc-\ntion, which usually lies 2 cm above the posterior knee crease.\nThere are numerous intercommunications between the long\nand short saphenous veins, and between the deep and super-\ufb01cial venous systems, via perforator or communicating veins. The\nvenous anatomy of the lower limb is highly variable.\nSuper \ufb01cial venous incompetence is characterised by varicose\nveins, aching and skin changes consistent with chronic venous\ninsuf \ufb01ciency (see Fig. 4.36A ).\n4.25 Investigations in peripheral arterial disease\nInvestigation Indication/comment\nDuplex ultrasound Carotid artery stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm surveillance, peripheral arterial disease\nComputed tomography Abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, carotid artery stenosisMagnetic resonance imaging Peripheral arterial disease, carotid artery stenosis, arteriovenous malformationsAngiography Acute and chronic limb ischaemia, carotid artery stenosisInvasive angiography has largely been replaced\nby computed tomography/magnetic resonance angiography as a diagnostic testAnatomy and physiology \u008177\n4"

Life-\nthreatening DVT may be asymptomatic, while apparently trivial\nvaricose veins may be associated with signi \ufb01cant symptoms.Pain\nPatients with uncomplicated varicose (dilated, tortuous, super \ufb01-\ncial) veins often complain of aching leg discomfort, itching and a\nfeeling of swelling (see Fig. 4.36A ). Symptoms are aggravated by\nprolonged standing and are often worse towards the end of the\nday. Once established, DVT causes pain and tenderness in the\naffected part (usually the calf). Super \ufb01cial thrombophlebitis pro-\nduces a red, painful area on the skin overlying the vein involved,\nand the vein may be palpable as a tender cord. Varicose ulcer-\nation may be surprisingly painless. If there is pain, this may be\nrelieved by limb elevation, but it is extremely important to exclude\ncoexisting arterial disease ( Box 4.26 ). Graduated compression\nbandaging is the mainstay of treatment for a venous leg ulcer,\nbut is contraindicated unless there is documented evidence of\nadequate arterial circulation, which is assessed by feeling the\npulses or by measuring the ABPI (see earlier).\nLimb swelling\nSwelling, or a feeling of swelling, even in the absence of visible\nsigns, may be associated with lower limb venous disease.\nEnquire about risk factors for DVT ( Box 4.27 ).\nIn upper limb DVT the arm is swollen and the skin is cyanosed\nand mottled, especially when dependent. Look for super \ufb01cial\ndistended veins (acting as collaterals) in the upper arm, over the\nshoulder region and on the anterior chest wall ( Fig. 4.37 ).\nSymptoms are often exacerbated by activity, especially when\nholding the arm overhead.\nThere may be a history of repetitive trauma at the thoracic\noutlet due to vigorous, repetitive exercise (e.g. swimming, weight\nlifting, or racquet sports). Upper limb DVT may also complicate\nindwelling subclavian/jugular venous catheters.\nSkin changes\nChronic venous insuf \ufb01ciency is often associated with bluish\ndiscoloration of the distal extremity. A range of skin changes may\nbe observed (see Fig. 4.36A ). Varicose eczema leads to red, itchy,\ndry areas of skin over the lower leg. Venous hypertension causes\nextravasation of blood components into surrounding tissues,\nleading to haemosiderin deposition, which is seen as a brown\ndiscoloration of the skin, primarily around the medial aspect of the\nlower third of the leg. Lipodermatosclerosis occurs when there is an\nin\ufb02ammatory response to the haemosiderin and causes red/purple\ndiscoloration and induration of the skin. The thickened, \ufb01brotic skin\nforms a tight band around the lower leg, giving the appearance of\nan inverted champagne bottle. In atrophie blanche ,t h e r ea r em u l -\ntiple, small, white, scarred areas within the affected skin.\nChronic venous ulceration\nIn developed countries, about 70 \u201380% of lower limb ulceration is\nprimarily due to venous disease.

Pos-\nteriorly, the lungs extend much lower, approaching the 12th rib\non full inspiration.\nThe lung apex lies immediately beneath the brachial plexus, so\napical lung tumours commonly disrupt T1 root \ufb01bres, causing\npain and numbness in the inner aspect of the upper arm and\nwasting of the small hand muscles. The upper thoracic sympa-\nthetic out \ufb02ow to the eye may also be compromised, leading to a\nconstricted pupil and ptosis. In the mid and lower mediastinum,\ntumours can invade and compromise the pericardium, atria and\noesophagus.\nIn health, the lungs optimise gas exchange by close matching\nof regional ventilation and perfusion. Airway and parenchymal\nlung diseases disrupt this matching, causing hypoxia and\ncyanosis, and commonly stimulate breathing through lung\nafferent nerves, leading to a history of breathlessness and\ntachypnoea upon examination.\nThe history\nThe key features of the history are summarised in Box 5.1 .\nFig. 5.1 Surface anatomy of the thorax.

            "Text": "Common presenting symptoms\nBreathlessness\nBreathlessness (dyspnoea) denotes the feeling of an \u2018uncom-\nfortable need to breathe \u2019and is the most commonly reported\nrespiratory symptom. It is also one of the most challenging to\nquantify, being inherently subjective. Breathlessness may be\ncaused by respiratory or cardiac disease and also occurs in\nanaemia or as a manifestation of psychological distress.\nRespiratory disease can cause breathlessness through a\nrange of mechanisms:\n\u0081stimulation of intrapulmonary afferent nerves by interstitial\nin\ufb02ammation or thromboembolism\n\u0081mechanical loading of respiratory muscles by air \ufb02ow\nobstruction or reduced lung compliance in \ufb01brosis\n\u0081hypoxia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, stimulating\nchemoreceptors.\nThe Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale\n(Box 5.2 ) is a useful and validated way to document formally the\npatient \u2019s level of dyspnoea.\nSpeci \ufb01c questions may help to distinguish the causes of\nbreathlessness. Ask in particular:\n\u0081How did the breathlessness start? If the onset was instan-\ntaneous, think of pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus or\nanaphylaxis. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (p. 47) may\nwake a sleeping patient with breathlessness. Onset over\nhours is typical in asthma, acute pulmonary oedema, lobar\npneumonia, or acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis, while an\ninsidious onset is more typical of an evolving pleural effusion,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial\nlung disease and lung tumours.\n\u0081How is your breathing at rest and overnight? Asthma\ncommonly wakes patients, while most patients with COPD are\ncomfortable at rest and when asleep but struggle with exer-\ntion. Breathlessness provoked by lying down (orthopnoea) is a\nfeature of heart failure (p. 47) but also occurs frequently in\npatients with severe air \ufb02ow obstruction or diaphragmaticweakness because the weight of the abdomen displaces the\ndiaphragm cranially on lying down, compromising the vital\ncapacity.\n\u0081Does your breathlessness vary from day to day or week to\nweek? Variable breathlessness is typical of asthma, whereas\npatients with COPD or interstitial lung disease usually report\nconsistent daily limitation.\n\u0081Can you tell me something you do that would make you\nbreathless? andHow far can you walk on a good day? These\nquestions reveal the disability caused by respiratory disease.\nRecord restrictions on normal activity or work and the cor-\nresponding MRC breathlessness score. Enquiring about\nhobbies and daily activities reveals the time course of\nbreathlessness; for example, \u2018When was the last time you\ncould walk to the shops / play a full round of golf? \u2019\n\u0081When does the breathlessness start? Asthma induced by\nexercise frequently appears only after exercise during early\nrecovery, because sympathetic drive during exercise defends\nairway patency.\nCertain phrases in the history strongly suggest a psychological\naetiology of breathlessness, particularly \u2018I feel I can \u2019t get enough\nair (or oxygen) into my chest. \u2019In patients with hyperventilation\ndue to anxiety, this symptom is frequently accompanied by a\nnormal measured vital capacity. Associated symptoms induced\nby hypocapnia in hyperventilation include digital and perioral\nparaesthesia, light-headedness and chest tightness.\nFig. 5.2 summarises how to use the history and examination\n\ufb01ndings to distinguish some common causes of breathlessness.\nRemember that patients do not always report exactly what\ntextbooks describe.\nWheeze\nWheeze describes the high-pitched musical or \u2018whistling \u2019sounds\nproduced by turbulent air \ufb02ow through small airways narrowed\nby bronchospasm and/or airway secretions. It is heard mostly\nduring expiration, which additionally narrows the airways.Wheeze must be distinguished from the rattling inspiratory and\nexpiratory sounds caused by loose, mobile secretions in the\nupper airways, and from the louder, dramatic croak of stridor\n(see below) caused by obstruction in the trachea or large air-\nways. Patients may be unaware of nocturnal wheeze, which may\nbe noticed only by their bed partner.\nWheeze is most commonly associated with asthma and\nCOPD but can also occur with acute bronchitis, exacerbations of\nbronchiectasis or congestive cardiac failure ( \u2018cardiac wheeze \u2019).\nAsk:\n\u0081Is the wheeze worse during or after exercise? If it occurs\nduring exercise and limits it, this suggests COPD; in asthma,\nwheeze and tightness usually appear after exercise.\n\u0081Do you wake with wheeze during the night? This suggests\nasthma.\n\u0081Do you have hay fever or other allergies? Atopy is common in\nallergic asthma. A family history of wheeze or asthma is\ncommon.5.2Medical Research Council breathlessness scale\nGrade Degree of breathlessness related to activities\n1 Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise\n2 Short of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a\nslight hill\n3 Walks slower than most people on the level, stops after a mile\nor so, or stops after 15 min walking at own pace\n4 Stops for breath after walking about 100 yards or after a few\nminutes on level ground\n5 Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when\nundressing\nUsed with the permission of the Medical Research Council.The history \u008185\n5"

The resulting hoarse forced expiration without the\ninitial explosive glottal opening is called a \u2018bovine cough. \u2019\nSputum\nIn health, the airway lining \ufb02uid coating the tracheobronchial tree\nascends the mucociliary escalator to the larynx, where it mixeswith upper respiratory tract secretions and saliva and is swal-\nlowed. In disease, the accumulation of in \ufb02ammatory cells, mucus\nand proteinaceous secretions in the airways results in cough with\nexpectoration of sputum. Ask the patient about the colour, vol-\nume and consistency of sputum. Direct examination of the\nsputum is useful to verify the account ( Fig. 5.3 ).\nIn acute or chronic airway infection, the characteristics of\nsputum help to clarify the pathology.

It is usually\nsited away from the midline and may be localised or affect a wide\narea of chest wall. Disease causes parietal pleural pain in several\nways:\n\u0081pneumonia and pulmonary infarcts: either direct pleural\nin\ufb02ammation or adhesions with pleural traction on respiratory\nmovement\n\u0081pneumothorax: mechanical distortion of pleura with lung\ncollapse\n\u0081lung cancer: pleural distortion by in \ufb01ltration, although con-\nstant pain is more typical\nMusculoskeletal chest pain is common and may occur with\nchest trauma, forceful coughing or connective tissue disease.\nThe chest is characteristically tender to palpation, and the pain\ncan be reproduced by respiratory movements and/or movement\nof the spine or shoulder muscles. There may be associated soft\ntissue injury or rib fractures. A detailed history of events pre-\nceding the onset is vital, as injury is easily overlooked.\nTwo other uncommon conditions can cause acute chest pain.\nBornholm disease is an infection with an enterovirus (CoxsackieB). This causes acute but self-limiting in \ufb02ammation of intercostal\nmuscles, with episodes of severe unilateral intercostal myalgia\nlasting a few days. Costochondritis (called Tietze \u2019s syndrome\nwhen costochondral swelling is present) is idiopathic in \ufb02amma-\ntion of the costochondral cartilages adjoining the sternum, with\nacute localised pain and tenderness. The pain is eased by simple\nanalgesia and settles spontaneously in both conditions.\nHerpes zoster infection (shingles) may start with super \ufb01cial itch\nor burning pain in a thoracic dermatome, followed by the\nappearance of a vesicular rash (a \u2018belt of roses from hell \u2019). Pain\nand altered sensation may persist long after the rash has\nresolved, often with scarring in the affected dermatome.\nBurning retrosternal pain may indicate oesophagitis but also\noccurs with myocardial ischaemia. Worsening of oesophageal\ndiscomfort after eating or relief after antacids helps to distinguish\nit from cardiac pain.\nCardiac pain is described on page 45.\nCentral, constant, progressive, non-pleuritic chest pain may\nrepresent mediastinal disease, particularly malignancy. Similarly,\nchest wall pain (without trauma) that is constant, progressive and\nnon-pleuritic suggests chest wall invasion by malignancy. Sleep\ndisturbance is a feature of such malignant pains.\nFevers/rigors/night sweats\nThese symptoms are not speci \ufb01c but are commonly reported by\npatients with respiratory illnesses. Infection (acute or chronic) isthe usual cause, but other aetiologies such as lung cancer,\nlymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered.\nPatients use many different terms to describe fever (e.g.,\nshivers, chills, shakes), so take care to clarify their actual\nsymptoms.\nRigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous\nbody shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the pa-\ntient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. Rigorsusually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and acute\npyelonephritis are the most common causes.\nNight sweats, particularly if persistent, are associated with\nchronic infection such as tuberculosis or malignancy, particularly\nlymphoma. Occasional episodes are inconclusive, but if patients\nreport having to change their nightclothes or sheets frequently\ndue to profuse nocturnal sweating over several weeks, this\nsuggests underlying disease.\nWeight loss\nWeight loss is a common feature of respiratory diseases,\nincluding lung cancer, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and\nchronic infections such as tuberculosis and bronchiectasis. The\npathophysiology is complex; however, breathlessness is asso-\nciated with diminished appetite, and the systemic in \ufb02ammatory\nresponse is also thought to contribute to weight loss.\nWeight loss also occurs in acute infection with loss of appetite,\nparticularly during hospitalisation. Ask the patient to estimate the\nextent and duration of weight loss and enquire about appetite\nand dietary intake.\nSleepiness\nExcessive daytime sleepiness may be a symptom of an under-\nlying sleep-related breathing disorder \u2013obstructive sleep apnoea\n(OSA) or OSA/sleep hypopnoea (OSASH). In these conditions,\nthe upper airway collapses intermittently and repeatedly during\nsleep. Partial obstruction results in snoring, but complete\ncollapse stimulates increased respiratory effort resulting in tran-\nsient wakening. Repeated episodes of sleep disturbance cause\nexcessive daytime sleepiness and poor concentration. OSASH is\nmore common in men; particularly if obese and with a large neck\n(collar sizes >17 inches) and can be aggravated by alcohol.\nAsk about:\n\u0081Normal sleeping habit: does the patient keep hours that allow\nreasonable rest?\n\u0081Shift or night work: this can disrupt and prevent healthy sleep\npatterns.\n\u0081Does the person wake refreshed or exhausted? Sleep\napnoea patients are exhausted in the morning.\n\u0081Have they struggled to stay awake in the day: for example, at\nwork or when driving?\nIt is vital to advise cessation of driving pending investigation if\nOSA is suspected.\nIdeally, seek a description of any night-time breathing distur-\nbance from a bed partner.

Domestic pets, especially cats and ro-\ndents, may be the cause of suboptimal asthma control. A pet\nbird, feather duvet or an infestation of mould may cause hyper-\nsensitivity pneumonitis or suboptimal asthma control.\nThe home circumstances may reveal the impact of respiratory\ndisability, for example if the patient has relocated to ground- \ufb02oor\naccommodations or relies on others for shopping.\nSmoking\nObtaining an accurate history of tobacco use is dif \ufb01cult and is\ncovered on page 16 ( Chapter 2 ). Ask if any cohabitees smoke;this can be a major obstacle to cessation. Remember also to ask\nabout cannabis, waterpipes and e-cigarettes. Cannabis may be\nsmoked without tobacco; for example using a bong; or cut with\ntobacco as an un \ufb01ltered joint. Waterpipes ( \u2018narghileh \u2019,\u2018shisha \u2019or\n\u2018hookah \u2019) are used to smoke tobacco, cannabis or \ufb02avoured\ntobacco ( maassel ).

Whilst the cause is often unknown, contact with birds,\nbird droppings or feathers, metal working \ufb02uids, hay and mould\nremain common causes.\nInhalation of inorganic dusts such as asbestos, coal or silica\ncause pneumoconiosis, with gradual onset of cough and breath-\nlessness, often years after exposure. Despite improved controls,\nasbestos and silica exposure remain important causes of ill health.\nCertain occupations increase the risk of respiratory infection,\nfor example Q fever in abattoir workers and leptospirosis in\nsewage workers and animal handlers.\nSystematic enquiry\nSystematic enquiry may reveal extrapulmonary symptoms linkedto underlying respiratory disease. For example, morning head-\naches can indicate an elevated PaCO\n2in respiratory failure,\ndysphagia following stroke can increase the risk of aspiration\npneumonia, and joint pains may indicate connective tissue dis-\nease underlying pleural or parenchymal lung disease.\nThe physical examination\nObservations made during history taking can be valuable. For\nexample, how easily did the patient converse? Did they cough\nrepeatedly?It is often easiest to examine the patient reclining on the bed or\nan examination couch at about 45 degrees, with the thorax\nexposed and the head supported by a pillow.\nInspection\nMuch can be learned about the respiratory system by carefulinspection from the end of the bed. The normal shape and\nrespiratory movements of the chest wall are signi \ufb01cantly altered\nby the hyperin \ufb02ation that accompanies chronic air \ufb02ow obstruc-\ntion ( Fig. 5.4 ). Such obstruction also causes prolonged expiration\nrelative to inspiration, and sometimes \u2018pursed-lip \u2019breathing on\nexpiration. Forceful inspiration at these very high lung volumes\nmay cause indrawing of the intercostal spaces during mid-\ninspiration and the recruitment of muscles not normally\ninvolved in breathing ( \u2018accessory muscles \u2019). These include the\nsternocleidomastoid muscles lifting the sternum, and the trape-zius and the scalenes lifting the shoulder girdle. Patients some-\ntime sit forwards and brace their arms on a surface, allowing\nthem to use the pectoralis major to pull the ribs outwards during\ninspiration. In contrast to the hyperin \ufb02ation of obstructive dis-\nease, interstitial disease causes small, stiff lungs, diminishes\nthoracic volume and raises resting respiratory rate.\nChest deformity ( Fig. 5.5 ) may be congenital, as in pectus\nexcavatum, or acquired, as in pectus carinatum. The latter is an\ninward displacement of the lower ribs with a prominent sternum,\ncaused by severe air \ufb02ow obstruction in early childhood, during\nrib cage development.

Look carefully for any scars,particularly under the pectoral fold for a thoracotomy scar and on\nthe lateral and posterior chest wall for scars from pleural biopsies\nand drains. In patients with a thin chest wall and increased\nrespiratory drive (as in exacerbation of COPD), forced, rapid\ninspiration often causes visible indrawing of the skin in the\nintercostal spaces during inspiration, seen more easily with\ntangential light (see Fig. 5.5A ).\nPalpation\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Locate the apex beat, the most inferior and lateral place\nwhere the \ufb01nger is lifted by the twisting systolic movement of\nthe cardiac apex. This is normally in the \ufb01fth intercostal space\nin the mid-clavicular line. Count down the intercostal spaces;\nthe second is below the second rib, which attaches at themanubriosternal junction.\n\u0081Palpate for a right ventricular heave using a straight arm, with\nthe palm over the lower sternum (see Fig. 4.18C ).\nThe apex beat is displaced laterally by dilatation of the ven-\ntricles or leftward displacement of the mediastinum. In patients\nwith signi \ufb01cant hyperin \ufb02ation, the apex beat may be impalpable\nbecause the lingula expands between the heart and the chestwall (see Fig. 5.4B ). In this situation, the heart sounds are often\nbarely audible and may be heard better by auscultating in the\nepigastrium.\nIn pulmonary hypertension, the lower sternum is lifted by the\ncardiac cycle (right ventricular heave) and a \ufb01nger gently placed\nover the pulmonary area may detect closure of the pulmonary\nvalve: a so-called palpable P2.\nNext, assess thoracic expansion in both the upper and lower\nanterior chest wall.\nExamination sequence (Video 2E)\n\u0081First, place the palms of your hands over the pectoral region\noverlying both upper lobes and oppose the elevated thumbs\nover the midline. Ask the patient to take a deep breath usingthe thumbs as pointers to judge how much each hand moves\noutwards. Then, cup your hands, with \ufb01ngers spread, around\nthe patient \u2019s lower anterior chest wall overlying the lingula and\nright middle lobe, pressing the \ufb01ngertips \ufb01rmly in the mid-axillary\nline. Pull your hands medially towards each other to tighten any\nloose skin, and once again use your thumbs (off the skin) as\npointers to judge how much each hand moves outwards whenthe patient is instructed to take a full breath in ( Fig. 5.13 ). In a\nhealthy thorax, the ribs move out and up with inspiration.\n\u0081Check for any asymmetry. This is more important than the ab-\nsolute degree of expansion, which will vary between individuals.\nIn COPD with hyperin \ufb02ation, the normal outward movement of\nthe lower ribs on inspiration is replaced by paradoxical inward\nmovement ( \u2018Hoover \u2019s sign \u2019), caused by contraction of the\nabnormally low, \ufb02at diaphragm (see Fig. 5.4 ). This important sign\nmay be missed if expansion is assessed only in the upper chest\nor from behind.Fig. 5.12 Examining for tracheal deviation.96\u0081THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM"

            "Text": "dullness \u2019is lost in hyperin \ufb02ated patients in whom the lingula\noverlies the heart (see Fig. 5.4 ). Clear resonance ( \u2018hyper-\nresonance \u2019) is the usual \ufb01nding over a pneumothorax, although\nthe difference between a normal lung and the pneumothorax\nmay be quite subtle because normal lung is almost all air.\nResonance on percussion together with unilateral absent breath\nsounds indicates pneumothorax.\nAuscultation\nTo understand chest auscultation, it is necessary to understandthe origin of breath sounds. The tracheobronchial tree branches\n23 times between the trachea and the alveoli. This results in an\nexponential rise in the number of airways and their combined\ncross-sectional area moving towards the alveoli. During a maximal\nbreath in and out, the same vital capacity (about 5 L of air in\nhealthy adults) passes through each generation of airway. In thelarynx and trachea, this volume must all pass through a cross-\nsectional area of only a few square centimetres and therefore\n\ufb02ow rate is fast, causing turbulence with vibration of the airway\nwall, generating sound. In the distal airway, the large combined\ncross-sectional area of the multitude of bronchioles means that\n5 L can easily pass at slow \ufb02ow rates, so \ufb02ow is normally virtually\nsilent. The harsh \u2018bronchial \u2019sound generated by the major airways\ncan be appreciated by listening with the diaphragm of the\nstethoscope applied to the larynx (try this on yourself).\nMost of the sound heard when auscultating the chest wall orig-\ninates in the large central airways but is muf \ufb02ed and deadened by\npassage through overlying air- \ufb01lled alveolar tissue; this, together\nwith a small contribution from medium-sized airways, results in\n\u2018normal \u2019breath sounds at the chest wall, sometimes termed \u2018ve-\nsicular \u2019. When healthy, air- \ufb01lled lungs become consolidated by\npneumonia or thickened and stiffened by \ufb01brotic scarring (e.g.,\npost-tuberculous scarring), sound conduction is improved, and the\ncentrally generated \u2018bronchial \u2019breath sounds may be auscultated\nclearly and loudly on the overlying chest wall. In the same way, with\nsoft speech ( \u2018s a yo n e ,o n e ,o n e \u2019), the laryngeal sounds are muf \ufb02ed\nby healthy lung but heard clearly and loudly at the chest wall\noverlying consolidation and \ufb01brotic scarring, due to improved\nconduction of major airway sounds through diseased lung.\nWhen there is lobar collapse caused by a proximal bronchial\nobstruction, the signs are different from those in simple consol-\nidation. The usual \ufb01ndings are diminished expansion, sometimes\nwith chest asymmetry due to loss of volume, dullness to per-\ncussion over the collapsed lobe, and reduced breath sounds and\nvocal resonance.\nWhen the lung tissue is physically separated from the chest\nwall by intervening air (pneumothorax) or \ufb02uid (pleural effusion),\nsound conduction is greatly impaired and the breath sounds are\nusually very quiet or absent. These two causes are readilydistinguished by percussion, which will be resonant with pneu-\nmothorax and dull over pleural \ufb02uid.\nUse of the stethoscope\nRemember to wear the stethoscope with the earpieces facing\nforwards to align them with your auditory canal. Normal breath\nsounds are relatively quiet, so the greater area of contact offeredby the diaphragm is usually well-adapted to chest auscultation.\nThe two common exceptions are in patients with:\n\u0081A cachectic chest wall with sunken intercostal spaces, where\nit may be impossible to achieve \ufb02at skin contact with the\ndiaphragm.\n\u0081A hairy chest wall, where movement of chest hairs against the\ndiaphragm is easily mistaken for lung crackles. In these situations,\nuse the stethoscope bell instead to listen to the breath sounds.\nBreath sounds\nAs with percussion, the absolute volume and character of breathsounds in individuals are greatly affected by the thickness,\nmuscularity and fat content of the chest wall. The symmetry of\nsounds is therefore the key feature.\nExamination sequence (Videos 2H and 2I)\n\u0081Auscultate the apices, comparing right with left, and changing\nto the bell if you cannot achieve \ufb02at skin contact with the\ndiaphragm.\n\u0081Ask the patient to take repeated slow, deep breaths in and\nout through their open mouth. Auscultate the anterior chest\nwall from top to bottom, always comparing mirror image\npositions on right and left before moving down.\n\u0081Use the same sequence of sites as for percussion (see\nFig. 5.15B and C).\n\u0081Note whether the breath sounds are soft and muf \ufb02ed, absent,\nor loud and harsh (bronchial, like those heard over the larynx).Seek and note any asymmetry and added sounds (see later),\ndeciding which side is abnormal.\n\u0081Auscultate the lateral chest wall in the mid-axillary line, again\ncomparing right with left before changing level.\nAdded sounds\nThe three common added sounds are wheezes, crackles and rubs.\nWheeze is a musical whistling sound accompanying air \ufb02ow\nand usually originates in narrowed small airways. It is most\ncommonly expiratory, due to dynamic airway narrowing on\nexpiration, but can also occur on inspiration. Usually, multiple\nwheezing sounds are heard together (polyphonic wheeze);\nthis sign is common in asthma, bronchitis and exacerbation of\nCOPD. A single (monophonic) wheeze that is present consis-\ntently with each breath and does not clear with coughing is\nconsistent with a \ufb01xed bronchial obstruction and may indicate an\nunderlying cancer partially obstructing a bronchus.\nCrackles are brief non-musical sounds that are most often\nheard on inspiration but may occur in any phase of breathing.\nThey are thought to represent the sudden opening of small\nairways but sometimes indicate secretions in the airways or\nunderlying interstitial \ufb01brosis. In healthy people, gravitational\ncompression of the dependent lung bases may cause a few\ncrackles on the \ufb01rst few deep breaths; these should clear with a\ndeliberate cough and are of no pathological signi \ufb01cance. Crackles\nthat persist after several breaths and a cough are pathological.\nThey are graded as \u2018\ufb01ne\u2019, meaning soft, multiple crackles, to\n\u2018coarse, \u2019indicating loud, scanty crackles that tend to change with\neach breath.

Fine crackles also\noccur in pulmonary oedema and some viral pneumonias. Coarse\ncrackles are generally heard in patients with signi \ufb01cant purulent\nairway secretions such as those with bronchopneumonia or\nbronchiectasis. Inspiratory crackles may also be heard over\nincompletely in \ufb02ated lung immediately above a pleural effusion.\nA pleural rub is a rasping, grating sound occurring with each\nbreath and sounding super \ufb01cial, just under the stethoscope, like\ntwo sheets of sandpaper rubbing together. It indicates pleural\nin\ufb02ammation, usually due to infection or infarction of the lung,\nand is often accompanied by pleuritic chest pain. In pneumonia,\na pleural rub and the associated pain may disappear if a para-\npneumonic effusion or empyema develops.\nVery rarely, a clicking or crunching sound may be heard\nsynchronous with the heartbeat; this can indicate a\npneumomediastinum.\nVocal resonance\nBreath sounds normally reveal the presence of consolidation or\n\ufb01brotic scarring (bronchial breath sounds) or pleural air or \ufb02uid\n(diminished or absent breath sounds). These signs can be\ncon\ufb01rmed by asking the patient to generate laryngeal sounds\ndeliberately ( \u2018Please say \u201cone, one, one \u201deach time I move my\nstethoscope \u2019) and listening on the chest wall in the same\nsequence of sites used for breath sounds. Through the stetho-\nscope, the spoken sound is muf \ufb02ed and deadened over healthy\nlung but is heard loudly and clearly over consolidated or \ufb01brotic\nscarred lung. As with breath sounds, vocal resonance is absent\nor greatly diminished over pneumothorax and pleural effusion.\n\u2018Whispering pectoriloquy \u2019may be used to con \ufb01rm the same\nchanges in sound conduction. Whispered speech is muf \ufb02ed tosilence by normal lung but may be heard over consolidated or\nscarred lung.\nInterpretation of the \ufb01ndings\nReview your \ufb01ndings and collate the positive features. Upon\ncompleting the history and examination, you should have a\nbroad idea of the respiratory illness category with which you are\ndealing. Consistent groups of signs may even be diagnostic; for\nexample, unilateral absent breath sounds, resonant percussion,\nand tracheal deviation to the opposite side in a collapsed patient\nindicate a likely tension pneumothorax.\nAs with any system, consider as you go the likely disease\ncategories and how these affect presentation. This approach is\nsummarised in Box 5.7 .\nInvestigations\nSelecting the relevant investigation depends on the clinical\nproblem revealed on history and examination. Investigations are\ncostly and many carry risks, so choose tests capable of dis-\ntinguishing the likely diagnoses and prioritise the most decisive\nones. In respiratory disease, imaging of the lungs is fundamental,\nbut respiratory function testing is equally important to distinguish\nobstructive disease of the airways from the restrictive pattern\nseen in many parenchymal diseases, and to quantify the degree\nof abnormality.

            "Text": "Anatomy and physiology\nThe gastrointestinal system comprises the alimentary tract, liver,\nbiliary system, pancreas and spleen. The alimentary tract ex-\ntends from the mouth to the anus and includes the oesophagus,\nstomach, small intestine or small bowel (comprising the duo-\ndenum, jejunum and ileum), colon (large intestine or large bowel)\nand rectum ( Figs 6.1 \u20136.2andBox 6.1 ).\nThe abdominal surface can be divided into nine regions by the\nintersection of two horizontal and two vertical planes ( Fig. 6.1C ).\nThe history\nGastrointestinal symptoms are common and are often caused by\nfunctional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Alarm\nsymptoms, indicating a more serious alternative or coexistent\ndiagnosis, include persistent vomiting, dysphagia, gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, weight loss, painless, watery, high-volume diar-\nrhoea, nocturnal symptoms, fever and anaemia. The risk of\nserious disease increases with age. Always explore the patient \u2019s\nideas, concerns and expectations about the symptoms (p. 5) to\nunderstand the clinical context.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nMouth symptoms\nBad breath (halitosis) due to gingival, dental or pharyngealinfection and dry mouth (xerostomia) are common mouth\nsymptoms. Rarely patients complain of altered taste sensation\n(dysgeusia) or a foul taste in the mouth (cacogeusia).\nAnorexia and weight loss\nAnorexia is a loss of appetite and/or a lack of interest in food. In\naddition to enquiring about appetite, ask \u2018Do you still enjoy your\nfood? \u2019\nWeight loss, in isolation, is rarely associated with serious\norganic disease. Ask how much weight has been lost, over what\ntime. Loss of less than 3 kg in the previous 6 months is rarely\nsigni \ufb01cant. Weight loss is usually the result of reduced energy\nintake, not increased energy expenditure. It does not speci \ufb01cally\nindicate gastrointestinal disease, although it is common in many\ngastrointestinal disorders, including malignancy and liver dis-\nease. Energy requirements average 2500 kcal/day for males and\n2000 kcal/day for females. Reduced energy intake arises fromdieting, loss of appetite, malabsorption or malnutrition. Increased\nenergy expenditure occurs in hyperthyroidism, fever or with the\nadoption of a more energetic lifestyle. A net calorie de \ufb01cit of\n1000 kcal/day results in weight loss of approximately 1 kg/week\n(7000 kcal y1 kg of fat). Greater weight loss during the initial\nstages of energy restriction arises from salt and water loss and\ndepletion of hepatic glycogen stores, not from fat loss. Rapid\nweight loss over days suggests loss of body \ufb02uid as a result of\nvomiting, diarrhoea or diuretics (1 L of water \u00bc1 kg).

It implies intact mucosal sensation, making oeso-\nphageal cancer unlikely.\nAbdominal pain\nCharacterise the pain using the acronym SOCRATES (seeBox 2.2 ). Ask about the characteristics described here.\nSite\nVisceral abdominal pain from distension of hollow organs,\nmesenteric traction or excessive smooth-muscle contraction is\ndeep and poorly localised in the midline. The pain is conducted\nvia sympathetic splanchnic nerves. Somatic pain from the pari-\netal peritoneum and abdominal wall is lateralised and localised to\nthe in \ufb02amed area. It is conducted via intercostal nerves.\nPain arising from foregut structures (stomach, pancreas, liver\nand biliary system) is localised above the umbilicus ( Fig. 6.4 ).\nCentral abdominal pain arises from midgut structures, such as\nthe small bowel and appendix. Lower abdominal pain arises from\nhindgut structures, such as the colon. In \ufb02ammation may cause\nlocalised pain: for example, left iliac fossa pain due to diverticular\ndisease of the sigmoid colon.\nPain from an unpaired structure, such as the pancreas, is\nmidline and radiates through to the back. Pain from paired\nstructures, such as renal colic, is felt on, and radiates to, the\naffected side ( Fig. 6.5 ). Torsion of the testis may present with\nabdominal pain (p. 267). In females, consider gynaecological\ncauses such as ruptured ovarian cyst, pelvic in \ufb02ammatory dis-\nease, endometriosis or ectopic pregnancy (p. 247).\nOnset\nSudden onset of severe abdominal pain, rapidly progressing to\nbecome generalised and constant, suggests a hollow viscus\nperforation (usually due to peptic ulceration, diverticular disease\nor colorectal cancer), a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or\nmesenteric infarction.\nTorsion of the caecum or sigmoid colon (volvulus) presents\nwith sudden abdominal pain associated with acute intestinal\nobstruction.\nForegut \u2013 pain localises\nto epigastric area\nMidgut \u2013 pain localises\nto periumbilical area\nHindgut \u2013 pain localises\nto suprapubic area\nFig. 6.4 Abdominal pain.

Other features such as breathlessness or\npalpitation suggest non-alimentary causes ( Box 6.3 ).\nHypotension and tachycardia following the onset of pain\nsuggest intra-abdominal sepsis or bleeding: for example, from a\npeptic ulcer, a ruptured aortic aneurysm or an ectopic\npregnancy.\nTiming\nDuring the \ufb01rst 1 \u20132 hours after perforation, a \u2018silent interval \u2019may\noccur when abdominal pain resolves transiently. The initial\nchemical peritonitis may subside before bacterial peritonitis be-\ncomes established. For example, in acute appendicitis, pain is\ninitially periumbilical (visceral pain) and moves to the right iliac\nfossa (somatic pain) when localised in \ufb02ammation of the parietal\nperitoneum becomes established. If the appendix ruptures,\ngeneralised peritonitis may develop. Occasionally, a localised\nappendix abscess develops, with a palpable mass and localised\npain in the right iliac fossa.A change in the pattern of symptoms suggests either that the\ninitial diagnosis was wrong or that complications have devel-\noped. In acute small bowel obstruction, a change from typical\nintestinal colic to persistent pain with abdominal tenderness\nsuggests intestinal ischaemia, as in strangulated hernia, and is an\nindication for urgent surgical intervention.\nAbdominal pain persisting for hours or days suggests an in-\n\ufb02ammatory disorder, such as acute appendicitis, cholecystitis or\ndiverticulitis.\nExacerbating and relieving factors\nPain exacerbated by movement or coughing suggests in \ufb02am-\nmation. Patients tend to lie still to avoid exacerbating the pain.\nPeople with colic typically move around or draw their knees up\ntowards the chest during spasms.\nSeverity\nExcruciating pain, poorly relieved by opioid analgesia, suggests\nan ischaemic vascular event, such as bowel infarction or\nruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Severe pain rapidly eased\nby potent analgesia is more typical of acute pancreatitis orperitonitis secondary to a ruptured viscus.\nFeatures of the pain can help distinguish between possible\ncauses ( Box 6.3 ).\nThe acute abdomen\nThe majority of general surgical emergencies are patients with\nsudden severe abdominal pain (an \u2018acute abdomen \u2019). Patients\nmay be so occupied by recent and severe symptoms that they\nforget important details of their history unless asked directly.\nSeek additional information from family or friends if severe pain,\nshock or altered consciousness makes it dif \ufb01cult to obtain a\nhistory from the patient. Note any relevant past history, such as\nknown diverticular disease in a patient with a possible acute\nperforation. Causes range from self-limiting to severe life-\nthreatening diseases ( Box 6.4 ). Evaluate patients rapidly, and\nthen resuscitate critically ill patients immediately before under-\ntaking further assessment and surgical intervention. Parenteral\nopioid analgesia to alleviate severe abdominal pain will help, not\nhinder, clinical assessment. In patients with undiagnosed acute\nabdominal pain, reassess their clinical state regularly, undertake\nurgent investigations and consider surgical intervention in a\ntimely fashion.\nDysphagia\nPatients with dysphagia complain that food or drink sticks when\nthey swallow.\nAsk about:\n\u0081onset: recent or longstanding\n\u0081nature: intermittent or progressive\n\u0081dif\ufb01culty swallowing solids, liquids or both\n\u0081the level where food is felt to stick\n\u0081any regurgitation or re \ufb02ux of food or \ufb02uid\n\u0081any associated pain (odynophagia) or heartburn\n\u0081any recent weight loss.\n\u0081past history of food bolus obstruction6.3Non-alimentary causes of abdominal pain\nDisorder Clinical features\nMyocardial infarction Epigastric pain without tenderness\nAngor animi (feeling of impending\ndeath)HypotensionCardiac arrhythmias\nDissecting aortic aneurysm Tearing interscapular pain\nAngor animi\nHypotension\nAsymmetry of femoral pulses\nAcute vertebral collapse Lateralised pain restricting movement\nTenderness overlying involved vertebra\nCord compression Pain on percussion of thoracic spine\nHyperaesthesia at affected dermatomewith sensory loss belowSpinal cord signs\nPleurisy Lateralised pain on coughing\nChest signs (e.g. pleural rub)\nHerpes zoster Hyperaesthesia in dermatomal\ndistributionVesicular eruption\nDiabetic ketoacidosis Cramp-like pain\nVomitingAir hungerTachycardiaKetotic breath\nPelvic in \ufb02ammatory disease\nor tubal pregnancySuprapubic and iliac fossa pain,\nlocalised tendernessNausea, vomitingFever\nTorsion of testis/ovary Lower abdominal pain\nNausea, vomitingLocalised tenderness110 \u0081THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM"

Globus does not\ninterfere with swallowing and is not related to eating.\nNeurological dysphagia resulting from bulbar or pseudobulbar\npalsy (p. 140) is worse for liquids than solids and may be\naccompanied by choking, spluttering and \ufb02uid regurgitating from\nthe nose.\nNeuromuscular dysphagia, or oesophageal dysmotility, pre-\nsents in middle age, is worse for solids and may be helped by\nliquids and sitting upright. Achalasia, when the lower oesopha-\ngeal sphincter fails to relax normally, typically results in dysphagia\nfor both solids and liquids and leads to progressive oesophageal\ndilatation above the sphincter. Over \ufb02ow of secretions and food\ninto the respiratory tract may then occur, especially at night when\nthe patient lies down, causing aspiration pneumonia. Oesopha-\ngeal dysmotility and acid re \ufb02ux can provoke oesophageal\nspasms and central chest pain, which may be confused with\ncardiac pain.\nA pharyngeal pouch may cause food to stick or be regurgi-\ntated undigested from previous days and may lead to recurrent\nchest infections due to chronic silent aspiration.\n\u2018Mechanical \u2019dysphagia is often due to oesophageal stricture\nbut can be caused by external compression. With weight loss, a\nshort history and no re \ufb02ux symptoms, suspect oesophagealcancer. Longstanding dysphagia without weight loss but\naccompanied by heartburn is more likely to be due to benign\npeptic stricture. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is the most common\ncause of food bolus obstruction and should be considered in\nyounger patients with dysphagia; it is associated with atopy and\nfood allergy. Record the site at which the patient feels the food\nsticking; although this is not an entirely reliable guide to the site of\nobstruction. If dysphagia is experienced high in the neck,consider tumours of the pharynx or larynx or extrinsic\ncompression from a mass lesion such as a thyroid goitre.\nNausea and vomiting\nNausea is the sensation of feeling sick.

Peptic ulcers seldom cause\npainless vomiting unless they are complicated by pyloric steno-\nsis, which causes projectile vomiting of large volumes of gastric\ncontent that is not bile-stained. Obstruction distal to the pylorus\nproduces bile-stained vomit. Severe vomiting without signi \ufb01cant\npain suggests gastric outlet or proximal small bowel obstruction.Faeculent vomiting of small bowel contents (not faeces) is a late\nfeature of distal small bowel or colonic obstruction. In peritonitis,\nthe vomitus is usually small in volume but persistent. The more\ndistal the level of intestinal obstruction, the more marked the\naccompanying abdominal distension and colic.\nVomiting is common in gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, pancre-\natitis and hepatitis. It is typically preceded by nausea but raised\nintracranial pressure may occur without warning. Severe pain\nmay precipitate vomiting, as in renal or biliary colic or myocardial\ninfarction.\nAnorexia nervosa and bulimia are eating disorders charac-\nterised by undisclosed, self-induced vomiting. In bulimia, weight\nis maintained or increased, unlike in anorexia nervosa, where\nprofound weight loss is common.\nOther non-gastrointestinal causes of nausea and vomiting\ninclude:\n\u0081drugs, such as opioids, theophyllines, digoxin, cytotoxic\nagents, antidepressants or alcohol\n\u0081pregnancy\n\u0081diabetic ketoacidosis\n\u0081renal or liver failure\n\u0081hypercalcaemia\n\u0081Addison \u2019s disease\n\u0081raised intracranial pressure (meningitis, brain tumour)\n\u0081vestibular disorders (labyrinthitis and M\u00e9ni\u00e8re \u2019s disease).\nWind and \ufb02atulence\nBelching, excessive or offensive \ufb02atus, abdominal distension and\nborborygmi (audible bowel sounds) are often called \u2018wind \u2019or\n\ufb02atulence. Clarify exactly what the patient means. Belching is due\nto air swallowing (aerophagy) and has no medical signi \ufb01cance. It\nmay indicate anxiety but sometimes occurs in an attempt to\nrelieve abdominal pain or discomfort and accompanies GORD.\nNormally, 200 \u20132000 mL of \ufb02atus is passed each day. Flatus is\na mixture of gases derived from swallowed air and colonic\nbacterial fermentation of poorly absorbed carbohydrates.\nExcessive \ufb02atus occurs particularly in lactase de \ufb01ciency and in-\ntestinal malabsorption.\nBorborygmi result from the movement of \ufb02uid and gas along\nthe bowel. Loud borborygmi, particularly if associated with\ncolicky discomfort, suggest small bowel obstruction or\ndysmotility.\nAbdominal distension\nAbdominal girth slowly increasing over months or years is usually\ndue to obesity but in a patient with weight loss, it suggests intra-abdominal disease. The most common causes of abdominal\ndistension are:\n\u0081fat due to obesity\n\u0081\ufb02atus due to pseudo-obstruction or bowel obstruction\n\u0081faeces due to subacute obstruction or constipation\n\u0081\ufb02uid due to ascites (accumulation of \ufb02uid in the peritoneal\ncavity; Fig. 6.6 ), tumours (especially ovarian) or a distended\nbladder\n\u0081fetus\n\u0081functional bloating ( \ufb02uctuating abdominal distension that de-\nvelops during the day and resolves overnight, usually\noccurring in irritable bowel syndrome).\nAltered bowel habit\nDiarrhoea\nClarify what patients mean by diarrhoea. They may complain offrequent stools or a change in the consistency of the stools.\nNormal frequency ranges from three bowel movements daily to\nonce every 3 days. Diarrhoea is the frequent passage of loose\nstools. Steatorrhoea is diarrhoea associated with fat malab-\nsorption.

Common causes of rectal bleeding include haemor-\nrhoids, anal \ufb01ssures (blood on the toilet paper or in the pan),\ncomplicated diverticular disease, colorectal cancer or colonic\npolyps, in \ufb02ammatory bowel disease, ischaemic colitis and\ncolonic angioectasias.\nJaundice\nJaundice is a yellowish discolouration of the skin, sclerae\n(Fig. 6.8 ) and mucous membranes caused by hyper-\nbilirubinaemia ( Box 6.7 ). There is no absolute level at which\njaundice is clinically detected but, in good light, most clinicians\nwill recognise jaundice when bilirubin levels exceed 50 mmol/L\n(2.92 mg/dL).\nAsk about:\n\u0081associated symptoms: abdominal pain, fever, weight loss,\nitching\n\u0081colour of stools (normal or pale) and urine (normal or dark)\n\u0081alcohol intake\n\u0081travel history and immunisations\n\u0081use of illicit or intravenous drugs\n\u0081sexual history\n\u0081previous blood transfusions\n\u0081recently prescribed drugs.\nUnconjugated bilirubin is insoluble and binds to plasma albu-\nmin; it is therefore not \ufb01ltered by the renal glomeruli. In jaundice\nfrom unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, the urine is a normal\ncolour (acholuric jaundice; Box 6.8 ).\nBilirubin is conjugated to form bilirubin diglucuronide in the liver\nand excreted in bile, producing its characteristic green colour. In\nconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, the urine is dark brown due to\nthe presence of bilirubin diglucuronide. In the colon, conjugated\nbilirubin is metabolised by bacteria to stercobilinogen and ster-\ncobilin, which contribute to the brown colour of stool. Stercobi-\nlinogen is absorbed from the bowel and excreted in the urine as\nurobilinogen, a colourless, water-soluble compound.\nPrehepatic jaundice\nIn haemolytic disorders, anaemic pallor combined with jaundice\nmay produce a pale lemon complexion. The stools and urine arenormal in colour. Gilbert \u2019s syndrome is common and causes un-\nconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Serum liver enzyme concentra-\ntions are normal and jaundice is mild (plasma bilirubin <100mmol/L\n(5.85 mg/dL)) but increases during prolonged fasting or intercur-\nrent febrile illness.\nHepatic jaundice\nHepatocellular disease causes hyperbilirubinaemia that is bothunconjugated and conjugated. Conjugated bilirubin leads to dark\nbrown urine. The stools are normal in colour.\nPosthepatic/cholestatic jaundice\nIn biliary obstruction, conjugated bilirubin in the bile does not\nreach the intestine, so the stools are pale. Obstructive jaundice\nmay be accompanied by pruritus (generalised itch) due to skin\ndeposition of bile salts. Obstructive jaundice with abdominal pain\nis usually due to gallstones; if fever or rigours also occur (Char-\ncot\u2019s triad), ascending cholangitis is likely. Painless obstructive\njaundice suggests malignant biliary obstruction, as in chol-\nangiocarcinoma or cancer of the head of the pancreas.\nObstructive jaundice can be due to intrahepatic as well as\nextrahepatic cholestasis, as in primary biliary cirrhosis, certain\nhepatotoxic drug reactions ( Box 6.9 ) and profound hepatocel-\nlular injury.\nGroin swellings and lumps\nAsk about:\n\u0081associated pain\nFig. 6.8 Yellow sclera of jaundice.6.7Common causes of jaundice\nIncreased bilirubin production\n\u0081Haemolysis (unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia)\nImpaired bilirubin excretion\n\u0081Congenital:\n\u0081Gilbert \u2019s syndrome (unconjugated)\n\u0081Hepatocellular:\n\u0081Viral hepatitis\n\u0081Cirrhosis\n\u0081Drugs\n\u0081Autoimmune hepatitis\u0081Intrahepatic cholestasis:\n\u0081Drugs\n\u0081Primary biliary cirrhosis\n\u0081Extrahepatic cholestasis:\n\u0081Gallstones\n\u0081Cancer: pancreas,\ncholangiocarcinoma\n6.8Urine and stool analysis in jaundice\nUrine Stools\nColour Bilirubin Urobilinogen Colour\nUnconjugated Normal \u2013 \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe\u00fe Normal\nHepatocellular Dark \u00fe\u00fe \u00fe\u00fe Normal\nObstructive Dark \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe\u00fe \u2013 PaleThe history \u0081115\n6"

Patients can often manually reduce the hernia\nby applying gentle pressure over the swelling or by lying \ufb02at. Other\ncauses of groin swellings include lymph nodes, skin and subcu-\ntaneous lumps and, less commonly, saphena varix (a varicosity of\nthe long saphenous vein), hydrocoele of the spermatic cord,\nundescended testis, femoral aneurysm or a psoas abscess.\nPast medical history\nHistory of a similar problem may suggest the diagnosis: forexample, pancreatitis, bleeding peptic ulcer or in \ufb02ammatory\nbowel disease. Coexisting peripheral vascular disease, hyper-\ntension, heart failure or atrial \ufb01brillation may suggest aortic\naneurysm or mesenteric ischaemia as the cause of acute\nabdominal pain. Primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hep-\natitis are associated with thyroid disease, and non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) is associated with diabetes and obesity.\nAsk about previous abdominal surgery.\nDrug history\nAsk about all prescribed medications, over-the-counter medi-cines and herbal preparations. Many drugs affect the gastroin-\ntestinal tract ( Box 6.9 ) and are hepatotoxic.Family history\nIn\ufb02ammatory bowel disease is more common in patients with a\nfamily history of either Crohn \u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis.\nColorectal cancer in a \ufb01rst-degree relative increases the risk of\ncolorectal cancer and polyps. Peptic ulcer disease may be fa-\nmilial but is mainly due to environmental factors, such as the\ntransmission of H. pylori infection. Gilbert \u2019s syndrome is an\nautosomal dominant condition; haemochromatosis and Wilson \u2019s\ndisease are autosomal recessive disorders. Autoimmune dis-\neases, particularly thyroid disease, are common in relatives of\nthose with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. A\nfamily history of diabetes is frequently seen in the context ofNAFLD.\nSocial history\nAsk about:\n\u0081Dietary history: assess the intake of calories and sources of\nessential nutrients. For guidance, there are 9 kcal per g of fat\nand 4 kcal per g of carbohydrates and protein.\n\u0081Food intolerances: patients with irritable bowel syndrome\noften report speci \ufb01c food intolerances, including wheat,\ndairy products and others. Painless diarrhoea may indi-\ncate high alcohol intake, lactose intolerance or coeliac\ndisease.\n\u0081Alcohol consumption: calculate the patient \u2019s intake in units\n(p. 75).\n\u0081Smoking: this increases the risk of oesophageal cancer,\ncolorectal cancer, Crohn \u2019s disease and peptic ulcer, while\npatients with ulcerative colitis are less likely to smoke.\n\u0081Stress: many disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome\nand dyspepsia, are exacerbated by stress and mental\ndisorders.\n\u0081Foreign travel: this is particularly relevant in liver disease and\ndiarrhoea.\n\u0081Risk factors for liver disease: these include intravenous\ndrug use, tattoos, foreign travel, blood transfusions, and\nsex between men or with prostitutes and multiple sexual\npartners. Hepatitis B and C may present with chronic liverdisease or cancer decades after the primary infection, so\nenquire about risk factors in the distant as well as the\nrecent past.\nThe physical examination\nExamination of the gastrointestinal system includes intimate ex-amination and consideration should be given to a patient \u2019s\npreference regarding the gender of the examining clinician and\nthe presence of a chaperone.

            "Text": "Abdominal swelling\nDiffuse abdominal swelling could be due to ascites or intestinal\nobstruction. If localised, it could be caused by urinary retention, a\nmass or an enlarged organ such as the liver. In obesity, the\numbilicus is usually sunken; in ascites, it is \ufb02at or, more\ncommonly, everted. Look tangentially across the abdomen and\nfrom the foot of the bed for any asymmetry suggesting a local-\nised mass.\nAbdominal scars and stomas\nNote any surgical scars or stomas and clarify what operations\nhave been undertaken ( Figs 6.10 and 6.11 ). A small infraumbilical\nincision usually indicates a previous laparoscopy. Puncture scars\nfrom laparoscopic surgical ports may be visible. An incisional\nhernia at the site of a scar is palpable as a defect in the\nabdominal wall musculature and becomes more obvious as the\npatient raises their head off the bed or coughs.\nPalpation\nExamination sequence (Video 6B)\n\u0081Ensure your hands are warm and clean.\n\u0081If the bed is low, kneel beside it but avoid touching the \ufb02oor to\nprevent infection.\n\u0081Ask the patient to show you where any pain is and to report\nany tenderness during palpation.\n\u0081Ask the patient to place their arms by their sides to help relax\nthe abdominal wall.\n\u0081Use your right hand, keeping it \ufb02at and in contact with the\nabdominal wall.\u0081Observe the patient \u2019s face throughout for any sign of\ndiscomfort.\n\u0081Begin with light super \ufb01cial palpation away from any site of\npain.\n\u0081Palpate each region in turn, and then repeat with deeper\npalpation.\n\u0081Test abdominal muscle tone using light, dipping \ufb01nger\nmovements.\n\u0081Describe any mass using the basic principles outlined in\nChapter 3 , p. 34. Describe its site, size, surface, shape and\nconsistency, and note whether it moves on respiration. Is the\nmass \ufb01xed or mobile?\n\u0081To determine if a mass is super \ufb01cial and in the abdominal wall\nrather than within the abdominal cavity, ask the patient to\ntense their abdominal muscles by lifting their head. An\nabdominal wall mass will still be palpable, whereas an intra-abdominal mass will not.\n\u0081Decide whether the mass is an enlarged abdominal organ or\nseparate from the solid organs.\nTenderness\nDiscomfort during palpation may vary and may be accompanied\nby resistance to palpation. Consider the patient \u2019s level of anxiety\nwhen assessing the severity of pain and degree of tenderness\nelicited. Tenderness in several areas on minimal pressure may be\ndue to generalised peritonitis but is more often caused by anxi-\nety. Severe super \ufb01cial pain with no tenderness on deep palpation\nor pain that disappears if the patient is distracted also suggests\nanxiety. With these exceptions, tenderness usefully indicates\nunderlying pathology.\nVoluntary guarding is the voluntary contraction of the\nabdominal muscles when palpation provokes pain. Involuntary\nguarding is the re \ufb02ex contraction of the abdominal muscles\nwhen there is in \ufb02ammation of the parietal peritoneum.

The liver is enlarged in\nearly cirrhosis but often shrunken in advanced cirrhosis. Fatty\nliver (hepatic steatosis) can cause marked hepatomegaly. He-\npatic enlargement due to metastatic tumour is hard and irreg-\nular. An enlarged left lobe may be felt in the epigastrium or eventhe left hypochondrium.

A bruit over the liver may be heard in acute\nalcoholic hepatitis, hepatocellular cancer, arteriovenous mal-\nformation and in patients with portal-systemic shunts. The most\ncommon reason for an audible bruit over the liver, however, is a\ntransmitted heart murmur.

Palpable distension of the\ngallbladder is rare and has a characteristic globular shape. It\nresults from either obstruction of the cystic duct, as in mucocoele\nor empyema of the gallbladder, or obstruction of the common\nbile duct with a patent cystic duct, as in pancreatic cancer. In a\njaundiced patient, a palpable gallbladder is likely to be due to\nextrahepatic obstruction, such as from pancreatic cancer or,\nvery rarely, gallstones (Courvoisier \u2019s sign). In gallstone disease,\nthe gallbladder may be tender but impalpable because of \ufb01brosis\nof the gallbladder wall.\nSplenomegaly\nThe spleen has to enlarge threefold before it becomes palpable,so a palpable spleen always indicates splenomegaly. It enlarges\nfrom under the left costal margin down and medially towards the\numbilicus ( Fig. 6.16B ). A characteristic notch may be palpable\nmidway along its leading edge, helping differentiate it from an\nenlarged left kidney ( Box 6.13 ).\nExamination sequence (Video 6D)\n\u0081Place your hand over the patient \u2019s umbilicus.

They normally occur every 5 \u201310\nseconds but the frequency varies.\nThe absence of bowel sounds implies paralytic ileus or peri-\ntonitis. In intestinal obstruction, bowel sounds occur with\nincreased frequency and volume and have a high-pitched,tinkling quality. Bruits suggest an atheromatous or aneurysmal\naorta or superior mesenteric artery stenosis.

An audible splash\nmore than 4 hours after the patient has eaten or drunk anything\nindicates delayed gastric emptying, as in pyloric stenosis.\nHernias\nThe inguinal canal extends from the pubic tubercle to the anteriorsuperior iliac spine ( Fig. 6.20 ). It has an internal ring at the mid-\ninguinal point (midway between the pubic symphysis and the\nanterior superior iliac spine) and an external ring at the pubic\ntubercle. The femoral canal lies below the inguinal ligament and\nlateral to the pubic tubercle.\nHernias are common and typically occur at openings of the\nabdominal wall, such as the inguinal, femoral and obturator ca-nals, the umbilicus and the oesophageal hiatus. They may also\noccur at sites of the weakness of the abdominal wall, as in\nprevious surgical incisions.\nAn external abdominal hernia is an abnormal protrusion of the\nbowel and/or omentum from the abdominal cavity. External\nhernias are more obvious when the pressure within the abdomen\nrises, such as when the patient is standing, coughing or straining\nat stool.

Ask the patient to cough and feel\nfor a cough impulse.\n\u0081Now ask the patient to lie down and establish whether the\nhernia reduces spontaneously.\n\u0081If so, press two \ufb01ngers over the internal inguinal ring at the\nmid-inguinal point and ask the patient to cough or stand upwhile you maintain pressure over the internal inguinal ring. Ifthe hernia reappears, it is a direct hernia. If it can be pre-\nvented from reappearing, it is an indirect inguinal hernia.\n\u0081Examine the opposite side to exclude the possibility of\nasymptomatic hernias.\nAn indirect inguinal hernia bulges through the internal ring and\nfollows the course of the inguinal canal. It may extend beyond the\nexternal ring and enter the scrotum. Indirect hernias comprise85% of all hernias and are more common in younger men.\nA direct inguinal hernia forms at a site of muscle weakness in\nthe posterior wall of the inguinal canal and rarely extends into the\nscrotum. It is more common in older men and women ( Fig. 6.21 ).\nA femoral hernia projects through the femoral ring and into the\nfemoral canal. Inguinal hernias are palpable above and medial to\nthe pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias are palpable below the\ninguinal ligament and lateral to the pubic tubercle.\nIn a reducible hernia, the contents can be returned to the\nabdominal cavity, spontaneously or by manipulation; if they\ncannot, the hernia is irreducible. An abdominal hernia has a\ncovering sac of the peritoneum and the neck of the hernia is a\ncommon site of compression of the contents ( Fig. 6.22 ). If the\nhernia contains bowel, obstruction may occur. If the blood\nsupply to the contents of the hernia (bowel or omentum) is\nrestricted, the hernia is strangulated. It is tense, tender and has\nno cough impulse, there may be bowel obstruction and, later,signs of sepsis and shock. A strangulated hernia is a surgical\nemergency and, if left untreated, will lead to bowel infarction and\nperitonitis.\nRectal examination\nDigital examination of the rectum is important ( Box 6.16 ).

Beyond the\nanal canal, the rectum passes upwards and backwards along\nthe curve of the sacrum.\nSpasm of the external anal sphincter is common in anxious pa-\ntients. When associated with local pain, it is probably due to an anal\n\ufb01ssure (a mucosal tear).

Examine it for stool colour and\nthe presence of blood or mucus ( Box 6.17 ).\nHaemorrhoids ( \u2018piles \u2019, congested venous plexuses around the\nanal canal) are usually palpable if thrombosed. In patients with\nchronic constipation, the rectum is often loaded with faeces.\nFaecal masses are frequently palpable, should be movable and\ncan be indented. In women, a retroverted uterus and the normal\ncervix are often palpable through the anterior rectal wall and a\nvaginal tampon may be confusing.

Check for\n\ufb01ssures, particularly if the patient reports pain during the\nprocedure.\n\u0081Ask the patient to strain down as you slowly withdraw the\ninstrument to detect any degree of rectal prolapse and the\npresence and severity of any haemorrhoids.\nProctoscopic examination of the anus and lower rectum can\ncon\ufb01rm or exclude the presence of haemorrhoids, anal \ufb01ssures\nand rectal prolapse. Rectal mucosa looks like buccal mucosa,\napart from the presence of prominent submucosal veins. During\nstraining, haemorrhoids distend with blood and may prolapse. If\nthe degree of protrusion is more than 3 \u20134 cm, a rectal prolapse\nmay be present.\nInvestigations\nSelecting the relevant investigation depends on the clinical\nproblem revealed on history and examination.

            "Text": "Anatomy and physiology\nThe nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord (central\nnervous system, CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral\nnervous system, PNS). The PNS includes the autonomic nervous\nsystem, which is responsible for controlling involuntary functions.\nThe neuron is the functional unit of the nervous system. Each\nneuron has a cell body and axon terminating at a synapse,\nsupported by astrocytes and microglial cells. Astrocytes provide\nthe structural framework for the neurons, control their\nbiochemical environment and form the blood-brain barrier.\nMicroglial cells are blood-derived mononuclear macrophages\nwith immune and scavenging functions. In the CNS, oligoden-\ndrocytes produce and maintain a myelin sheath around the\naxons. In the PNS, myelin is produced by Schwann cells.\nThe brain consists of two cerebral hemispheres, each with\nfour lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital), the brain-\nstem and the cerebellum. The brainstem comprises the\nmidbrain, pons and medulla. The cerebellum lies in the posterior\nfossa, with two hemispheres and a central vermis attached to\nthe brainstem by three pairs of cerebellar peduncles. Between\nthe brain and the skull are three membranous layers called the\nmeninges: dura mater next to the bone, arachnoid and pia\nmater next to the nervous tissue. The subarachnoid space\nbetween the arachnoid and pia is \ufb01lled with cerebrospinal \ufb02uid\n(CSF) produced by the choroid plexuses. The total volume of\nCSF is between 140 and 270 mL, and there is a turnover of the\nentire volume three to four times a day; thus, CSF is produced\nat a rate of approximately 700 mL/day.\nThe spinal cord contains afferent and efferent \ufb01bres arranged\nin discrete bundles (pathways running to and from the brain),\nwhich are responsible for transmitting motor and sensory infor-\nmation. Peripheral nerves have myelinated and unmyelinated\naxons. The sensory cell bodies of peripheral nerves are situated\nin the dorsal root ganglia. The motor cell bodies are in the\nanterior horns of the spinal cord ( Fig. 7.1 ).\nThe history\nFor many common neurological symptoms such as headache,\nnumbness, disturbance/loss of consciousness and memory\nloss, the history is the key to diagnosis, as the examination may\nbe normal. Some symptoms, including loss of consciousness or\namnesia, require an additional witness history; make every effort\nto contact such witnesses. Whilst histories can lend themselves\nto remote consulting, remote neurological examination is chal-\nlenging if not impossible. People with communication dif \ufb01culties\n(e.g. due to deafness, spoken language, cognitive impairment, or\nnon-verbal such as autism) require particularly careful attention to\novercome these barriers.\nRemember the two key questions: where (in the nervous\nsystem) is the lesion and what is the lesion?\nNeurological symptoms may be dif \ufb01cult for patients to\ndescribe, so clarify exactly what they mean. Words such as\n\u2018blackout \u2019,\u2018dizziness \u2019,\u2018weakness \u2019and \u2018numbness \u2019may havedifferent meanings for different patients, so ensure you under-\nstand what the person is describing.\nAsk patients what they think or fear might be wrong with them,\nas neurological symptoms cause much anxiety. Patients\ncommonly research their symptoms on the internet; searches on\ncommon benign neurological symptoms, like numbness or\nweakness, usually list the most alarming (and unlikely) diagnoses\nsuch as multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease or brain tu-mours \ufb01rst, and almost never mention more common conditions\nsuch as carpal tunnel syndrome or functional disorders.\nTime relationships\nThe onset, duration and pattern of symptoms over time often\nprovide diagnostic clues: for example, in assessing headache\n(Box 7.1 ) or vertigo (see Box 9.3 ).\nAsk:\n\u0081When did the symptoms start (or when was the patient last\nwell)?\n\u0081Are they persistent or intermittent?\n\u0081If persistent, are they getting better, getting worse or staying\nthe same?\n\u0081If intermittent, how long do they last, and how long does the\npatient remain symptom-free in between episodes?\n\u0081Was the onset sudden or gradual/evolving?\nPrecipitating, exacerbating or relieving factors\n\u0081What was the patient doing when the symptoms occurred?\n\u0081Does anything make the symptoms better or worse, such as\ntime of day, menstrual cycle, posture or medication?\nAssociated symptoms\nAssociated symptoms can aid diagnosis. For example, head-ache may be associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia\n(aversion to light) and/or phonophobia (aversion to sound) in\nmigraine; headache with neck stiffness, fever and rash may be\nassociated with meningitis (see Box 7.1 ).\nCommon presenting symptoms\nHeadache\nHeadache is the most common neurological symptom and may\nbe either primary or secondary to other pathology. Primary\n(idiopathic) causes are the most common and include:\n\u0081migraine\n\u0081tension-type headache\n\u0081trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (including cluster\nheadache)\n\u0081primary stabbing, cough, exertional or sex headache\n\u0081primary thunderclap headache\n\u0081new daily persistent headache.134 \u0081THE NERVOUS SYSTEM"

            "Text": "Secondary (or symptomatic) headaches include potentially life-\nthreatening or disabling causes, such as subarachnoid hae-\nmorrhage or temporal arteritis. One of the key history aspects is\nrapidity of onset; isolated headache with a truly abrupt onset may\nrepresent a potentially serious cause, such as subarachnoid\nhaemorrhage or cerebral vein thrombosis, whereas recurrent\nheadache is much more likely to be migraine, particularly if\nassociated with other migrainous features (see Box 7.1 ). Asking\npatients what they do when they have a headache can be\ninstructive. For example, abandoning normal tasks and seeking a\nbed in a dark, quiet room suggest migraine, whereas pacing\naround the room in an agitated state, or even headbanging,\nsuggests cluster headache.\nTransient loss of consciousness (TLOC)\nSyncope is loss of consciousness due to inadequate cerebral\nperfusion and is the most common cause of transient loss of\nconsciousness (TLOC). Vasovagal (or re \ufb02ex) syncope (fainting) is\nthe most common type and is precipitated by stimulation of the\nparasympathetic nervous system by factors such as pain or\nintercurrent illness. Exercise-related syncope, or syncope with no\nwarning or trigger, suggests a possible cardiac cause. TLOC on\nstanding is suggestive of orthostatic (postural) hypotension and\nmay be caused by drugs (antihypertensives or levodopa) or\nassociated with autonomic neuropathies, which may complicate\nconditions such as diabetes.Seizure\nAn epileptic seizure is caused by paroxysmal electrical dis-\ncharges from either the whole brain (generalised seizure) or part\nof the brain (focal seizure). A tonic-clonic seizure (convulsion) isthe most common form of generalised seizure and typically fol-\nlows a stereotyped pattern with early loss of consciousness\nassociated with body stiffening (tonic phase) succeeded by\nrhythmical jerking crescendoing and subsiding over 30 to 120\nseconds (clonic phase); this is followed by a period of unre-\nsponsiveness (often with heavy breathing, the patient appearing\nto be deeply asleep) and \ufb01nally confusion or amnesia as the\npatient reorientates (postictal phase). The history from the patient\nand witnesses can help distinguish syncope from epilepsy\n(Box 7.2 ).

A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is the same,\nbut symptoms resolve within 24 hours. TIAs are an important risk\nfactor for impending stroke and demand urgent assessment and\ntreatment. Hemiplegia following middle cerebral artery occlusion\nis a typical example, but symptoms are dictated by the vascular\nterritory involved. Much of the cerebral hemispheres are supplied\nby anterior circulation (the anterior and middle cerebral arteries\nare derived from the internal carotid artery), while the occipital\nlobes and brainstem are supplied by posterior (vertebrobasilar)\ncirculation ( Fig. 7.2 ).A useful and simple clinical system for classifying strokes is\nshown in Box 7.3 .\nIsolated vertigo, amnesia or TLOC are rarely, if ever, due to\nstroke. In the Western world about 80% of strokes are ischae-\nmic, the remainder haemorrhagic. Haemorrhagic stroke is much\nmore frequent in Asian populations. Factors in the history or\nexamination that increase the likelihood of haemorrhage rather\nthan ischaemia include the use of anticoagulation, headache,vomiting, seizures and early reduced consciousness, although\nbrain imaging is necessary to be de \ufb01nitive.

            "Text": "artery syndrome is most common and causes loss of motor\nfunction and pain/temperature sensation, with relative sparing of\njoint position and vibration sensation below the level of the lesion.\nDizziness and vertigo\nPatients use \u2018dizziness \u2019to describe many sensations. Recurrent\n\u2018dizzy spells \u2019affect approximately 30% of those over 65 years\nand can be due to postural hypotension, cerebrovascular dis-\nease, cardiac arrhythmia or hyperventilation induced by anxiety\nand panic. Vertigo (the illusion of movement) speci \ufb01cally indicates\na problem in the vestibular apparatus (peripheral) or, much less\ncommonly, the brain (central) (see Box 9.3 and p. 201). Identi-\nfying a speci \ufb01c cause of dizziness is often challenging but may be\nrewarding in some cases, including benign paroxysmal positional\nvertigo (BPPV), which is eminently treatable. As a guide, recur-\nrent episodes of vertigo lasting a few seconds are most likely to\nbe due to BPPV; vertigo lasting hours may be caused by\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re \u2019s disease (with associated symptoms including hearing\nloss, tinnitus, nausea and vomiting) or migrainous vertigo (with or\nwithout headache); brain stem or cerebellar stroke may also\npresent with vertigo, often associated with ataxia, diplopia and\nother motor or sensory symptoms and is an important diagnosis\nnot to miss.\nFunctional neurological symptoms\nMany neurological symptoms are not due to organic or structural\ndisease. These symptoms are often called \u2018functional \u2019but other\n(less useful and more pejorative) terms include psychogenic,\nhysterical, somatisation or conversion disorders. Presentations\ninclude blindness, tremor, weakness and collapsing attacks, and\npatients will often describe numerous other symptoms, with fa-\ntigue, lethargy, pain, anxiety and other mood disorders\ncommonly associated. Diagnosing functional symptoms requires\nexperience and patience (p. 424). Clues include symptoms not\ncompatible with disease (such as retained awareness of\nconvulsing, or being able to walk normally backwards but not\nforwards), considerable variability in symptoms (such as inter-\nmittent recovery of a hemiparesis), multiple symptoms (often with\nnumerous previous assessments by other specialties, particularly\ngynaecology, gastroenterology, ear, nose and throat and\ncardiorespiratory) and multiple unremarkable investigations,\nleading to numerous different diagnoses. The size of a patient \u2019s\ncase notes can sometimes be a clue in itself! Beware of labelling\nsymptoms as functional simply because they appear odd or\ninexplicable, and remember that functional and organic disease\nmay coexist. Like disease, most functional neurological disorders\nfollow recognisable patterns, so be cautious when the pattern is\natypical.\nPast medical history\nSymptoms that the patient has forgotten about or overlookedmay be important; for example, a history of previous visual loss\n(optic neuritis) in someone presenting with numbness suggestsmultiple sclerosis. Birth history and development may be signif-\nicant, as in epilepsy. Contact parents or family doctors to obtain\nsuch information. If considering a vascular cause of neurological\nsymptoms, ask about important risk factors, such as other\nvascular diseases, hypertension, family history and smoking.\nDrug history\nAlways enquire about drugs, including prescribed, over-the-counter, complementary and recreational/illegal ones, as they\ncan give rise to many neurological symptoms (for example,\nphenytoin toxicity causing ataxia; excessive intake of analgesia\ncausing medication overuse headache). Recent vaccinations\nmay be relevant when faced with rapidly progressive weakness\n(Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) or cerebral venous thrombosis\n(COVID-19 vaccinations). The absence of vaccinations (e.g. polio\nor measles) may be overlooked initially but may provide crucialclues for diagnosis.\nFamily history\nObtain a family history for at least \ufb01rst-degree relatives: parents,\nsiblings and children. In some communities, parental consan-\nguinity is common, increasing the risk of autosomal recessive\nconditions, so you may need to enquire sensitively about this.\nSome neurological disorders are caused by single-gene defects,such as myotonic dystrophy or Huntington \u2019s disease. Others\nhave important polygenic in \ufb02uences, as in multiple sclerosis or\nmigraine. Some conditions have a variety of inheritance patterns;\nfor example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may be autosomal\ndominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked. Mitochondria\nuniquely have their own DNA, and abnormalities in this DNA can\ncause a range of disorders (such as diabetes, short stature and\ndeafness) that manifest in many different systems and may cause\ncommon neurological syndromes such as migraine or epilepsy.\nSome diseases, such as Parkinson \u2019s or motor neuron disease,\nmay be either due to single-gene disorders or sporadic.\nSocial history\nSocial circumstances are relevant. How are patients coping withtheir symptoms? Are they able to work and drive? What are their\nsupport circumstances, and are these adequate?\nAlcohol is the most common neurological toxin and damages\nboth the CNS (ataxia, seizures, dementia) and the PNS (neu-\nropathy). Poor diet with vitamin de \ufb01ciency may compound these\nproblems and is relevant in areas affected by famine, alcoholism\nor dietary exclusion. Vegetarians may be susceptible to vitamin\nB\n12de\ufb01ciency. Recreational drugs may affect the nervous sys-\ntem; for example, nitrous oxide inhalation causes subacute\ncombined degeneration of the cord due to dysfunction of the\nvitamin B 12pathway, cocaine can cause seizures and smoking\ncontributes to vascular and malignant disease. Always consider\nsexually transmitted or blood-borne infection, such as human\nimmunode \ufb01ciency virus (HIV) or syphilis, as both can cause a\nwide range of neurological symptoms and are treatable.

Post-viral syndromes, including post-\nCOVID-19, may cause persistent and disabling symptoms in a\nminority.\nOccupational history\nOccupational factors are relevant to several neurological disor-\nders. For example, toxic peripheral neuropathy, due to exposure\nto heavy or organic metals like lead, causes motor neuropathy;\nmanganese causes Parkinsonism. Some neurological diagnoses\nmay adversely affect a patient \u2019s occupation, such as epilepsy in\nanyone who needs to drive or operate dangerous machinery. Forpatients with cognitive disorders, particularly dementias, it may\nbe necessary to advise on whether to stop working.\nThe physical examination\nAlthough history-taking can be undertaken remotely, a neuro-logical examination ideally requires direct patient contact.\nNeurological assessment begins with your \ufb01rst contact with the\npatient and continues during the history. Note facial expression,\ndemeanour, dress, posture, gait and speech. Mental state ex-\namination (p. 368) and general examination (p. 385) are integral\nparts of the neurological examination.\nAssessment of conscious level\nConsciousness has two main components:\n\u0081The state of consciousness depends largely on the integrity of\nthe ascending reticular activating system, which extends from\nthe brainstem to the thalamus.\n\u0081The content of consciousness refers to how aware the per-\nson is and depends on the cerebral cortex, the thalamus and\ntheir connections.\nDo not use ill-de \ufb01ned terms such as stuporose or obtunded.\nUse the Glasgow Coma Scale (see Box 18.5 ), a reliable and\nreproducible tool, to record consciousness level.\nMeningeal irritation\nMeningism (in \ufb02ammation or irritation of the meninges) can lead to\nincreased resistance to passive \ufb02exion of the neck (neck stiff-\nness) or the extended leg (Kernig \u2019s sign). Patients may lie with\n\ufb02exed hips to ease their symptoms. Meningism suggests infec-\ntion (meningitis) or blood within the subarachnoid space (sub-\narachnoid haemorrhage) but can occur with non-neurological\ninfections, such as a urinary tract infection or pneumonia.\nConversely, the absence of meningism does not exclude pa-\nthology within the subarachnoid space. In meningitis, neck\nstiffness has relatively low sensitivity but higher speci \ufb01city. The\nabsence of all three signs of fever, neck stiffness and altered\nmental state virtually eliminates the diagnosis of meningitis in\nimmunocompetent individuals.Examination sequence (Video 7)\n\u0081Position the patient supine with no pillow.\n\u0081Expose and fully extend both of the patient \u2019s legs.\nNeck stiffness\n\u0081Place your hands on either side of the patient \u2019s head, sup-\nporting the occiput.\n\u0081Flex the patient \u2019s head gently until their chin touches their\nchest.\n\u0081Ask the patient to hold that position for 10 seconds.

The\ntongue is contracted and stiff. Bulbar palsy results from bilateral\nlower motor neuron lesions affecting the same group of cranial\nnerves (IX, X, XI, XII). The nature of the speech disturbance is\ndetermined by the speci \ufb01c nerves and muscles involved.\nWeakness of the tongue results in dif \ufb01culty with lingual sounds,\nwhile palatal weakness gives a nasal quality to the speech. Other\nlower motor neuron signs such as a wasted, \ufb01brillating tongue\nmay be seen.\nCerebellar dysarthria is slow and slurred, similar to alcohol\nintoxication. Myasthenia gravis causes fatiguing speech that\nbecomes increasingly nasal and may disappear altogether.\nParkinsonism may cause dysarthria and dysphonia, with a low-\nvolume, monotonous voice, words running into each other\n(festination of speech) and marked stuttering/hesitation.\nDysphonia usually results from either vocal cord pathology, as\nin laryngitis, or damage to the vagal (X) nerve supply to the vocal\ncords (recurrent laryngeal nerve). Inability to abduct one of the\nvocal cords leads to a \u2018bovine \u2019(and ineffective) cough.\nDysphasia\nDysphasia is a central disturbance of language resulting in ab-\nnormalities of speech production and/or understanding. It may\ninvolve other language symptoms, such as writing and/or\nreading problems, unlike dysarthria and dysphonia.\nAnatomy\nThe language areas are located in the dominant cerebral hemi-\nsphere, which is the left in almost all right-handed people and\nmost left-handed people.\nBroca \u2019s area (inferior frontal region) is concerned with word\nproduction and language expression.\nWernicke \u2019s area (superior posterior temporal lobe) is the\nprincipal area for comprehension of spoken language. Adjacentregions of the parietal lobe are involved in understanding written\nlanguage and numbers.\nThe arcuate fasciculus connects Broca \u2019s and Wernicke \u2019s\nareas.\nExamination sequence\n\u0081During spontaneous speech, listen to the \ufb02uency and\nappropriateness of the content, particularly paraphasias\n(incorrect words) and neologisms (nonsense or meaninglessnew words).\n\u0081Show the patient a common object, such as a coin or pen,\nand ask them to name it.\n\u0081Give a simple three-stage command, such as \u2018Pick up this\npiece of paper, fold it in half and place it under the book. \u2019\n\u0081Ask the patient to repeat a simple sentence, such as \u2018Today\nis Tuesday. \u2019\n\u0081Ask the patient to read a passage from a newspaper.\n\u0081Ask the patient to write a sentence; examine the handwriting.\nExpressive (motor) dysphasia results from damage to Broca \u2019s\narea. It is characterised by reduced verbal output with non- \ufb02uent\nspeech and errors of grammar and syntax. Comprehension is\nintact.\nReceptive (sensory) dysphasia occurs due to dysfunction in\nWernicke \u2019s area. There is poor comprehension, and although\nspeech is \ufb02uent, it may be meaningless and contain paraphasias\nand neologisms.\nGlobal dysphasia is a combination of expressive and receptive\ndif\ufb01culties caused by involvement of both areas.\nDysphasia (a focal sign) is frequently misdiagnosed as confu-\nsion (non-focal). Always consider dysphasia before assuming\nconfusion, as this fundamentally alters the differential diagnosis\nand management.\nDominant parietal lobe lesions affecting the supramarginal\ngyrus may cause dyslexia (dif \ufb01culty comprehending written lan-\nguage), dyscalculia (problems with simple addition and sub-\ntraction) and dysgraphia (impairment of writing). Gerstmann \u2019s\nsyndrome is the combination of dysgraphia, dyscalculia, \ufb01nger\nagnosia (inability to recognise the \ufb01ngers) and inability to distin-\nguish left from right. It localises to the left parietal lobe in the\nregion of the angular gyrus.\nCortical function\nThinking, emotions, language, behaviour, planning and initiationof movements and perception of sensory information are func-\ntions of the cerebral cortex and are central to awareness of, and\ninteraction with, the environment. Certain cortical areas are\nassociated with speci \ufb01c functions, so particular patterns of\ndysfunction can help localise the site of pathology ( Fig. 7.4A ).\nAssessment of higher cortical function can be dif \ufb01cult and time-\nconsuming but is essential in patients with cognitive symptoms.\nThere are various tools, primarily developed as screening and\nassessment tools for dementia.

The motor\nstrip is organised somatotopically ( Fig. 7.4B ). The area anterior\nto the precentral gyrus is concerned with personality, social\nbehaviour, emotions, cognition and expressive language, and\ncontains the frontal eye \ufb01elds and cortical centre for micturition\n(Fig. 7.4A ).\nFrontal lobe damage may cause:\n\u0081personality and behaviour changes, such as apathy or\ndisinhibition\n\u0081loss of emotional responsiveness, or emotional lability\n\u0081cognitive impairments, such as memory, attention and\nconcentration\n\u0081dysphasia (dominant hemisphere)\n\u0081conjugate gaze deviation to the side of the lesion\n\u0081urinary incontinence\n\u0081primitive re \ufb02exes, such as grasp\n\u0081focal motor seizures (motor strip).\nTemporal lobe\nThe temporal lobe contains the primary auditory cortex, Wer-\nnicke \u2019s area and parts of the limbic system. The latter is crucially\nimportant in memory, emotion and smell appreciation. The\ntemporal lobe also contains the lower \ufb01bres of the optic radiation\nand the area of auditory perception.\nTemporal lobe dysfunction may cause:\n\u0081Memory impairment\n\u0081Focal seizures with psychic symptoms\n\u0081Contralateral upper quadrantanopia (see Fig. 8.5 [4])\n\u0081Receptive dysphasia (dominant hemisphere).\nParietal lobe\nThe postcentral gyrus (sensory strip) is the most anterior part of\nthe parietal lobe and is the principal destination of conscious\nsensations. The upper \ufb01bres of the optic radiation pass through\nit.

These cells synapse with second-order neurons,\nwhich project centrally via the olfactory tract to the medial tem-\nporal lobe and amygdala.\nExamination sequence\nBedside testing of smell is of limited clinical value and rarely\nperformed, although objective \u2018scratch and sniff \u2019test cards, such\nas the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identi \ufb01cation Test\n(UPSIT), are available. You can ask patients if they think their\nsense of smell is normal, although self-reporting can be sur-\nprisingly inaccurate.\nHyposmia or anosmia (reduction or loss of the sense of\nsmell) may result from upper respiratory infection (for example\nwith the Sars-CoV-2 virus), sinus disease, damage to the ol-\nfactory \ufb01laments after head injury or infection, local\ncompression (by olfactory groove meningioma, for example,\nsee Fig. 7.29C ) or invasion by basal skull tumours. Distur-\nbance of smell may also occur very early in Parkinson \u2019sa n d\nAlzheimer \u2019s diseases. Patients often note hypogeusia/ageusia\n(altered taste) with anosmia too, as taste is crucially in \ufb02uenced\nby the sense of smell.142 \u0081THE NERVOUS SYSTEM"

Phantosmia, when patientsdescribe a persistent smell, often cigarette smoke, is common\nand usually benign.\nOptic (II), oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and\nabducens (VI) nerves\nSee Chapter 8 .\nTrigeminal (V) nerve\nThe V nerve conveys sensation from the face, mouth and part of\nthe dura and provides motor supply to the muscles of\nmastication.\nAnatomy\nThe cell bodies of the sensory \ufb01bres are located in the trigeminal\n(Gasserian) ganglion, which lies in a cavity (Meckel \u2019s cave) in the\npetrous temporal dura (see Fig. 7.5 ). From the trigeminal gan-\nglion, the V nerve passes to the pons. From here, pain and\ntemperature pathways descend to the C2 segment of the spinal\ncord, so ipsilateral facial numbness may occur with cervical cord\nlesions.\nThere are three major branches of V ( Fig. 7.6 ):\n\u0081ophthalmic (V 1): sensory\n\u0081maxillary (V 2): sensory\n\u0081mandibular (V 3): sensory and motor.The ophthalmic branch leaves the ganglion and passes for-\nward to the superior orbital \ufb01ssure via the wall of the cavernous\nsinus (see Fig. 8.3 ). In addition to the skin of the upper nose,\nupper eyelid, forehead and scalp, V 1supplies sensation to the\neye (cornea and conjunctiva) and the mucous membranes of the\nsphenoidal and ethmoid sinuses and upper nasal cavity.\nThe maxillary branch (V 2) passes from the ganglion via the\ncavernous sinus to leave the skull by the foramen rotundum. Itcontains sensory \ufb01bres from the mucous membranes of the\nupper mouth, roof of the pharynx, gums, teeth and palate of the\nupper jaw and the maxillary, sphenoidal and ethmoid sinuses.\nThe mandibular branch (V\n3) exits the skull via the foramen\novale and supplies the \ufb02oor of the mouth, sensation (but not\ntaste) to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, the gums and\nteeth of the lower jaw, mucosa of the cheek and the temporo-\nmandibular joint, in addition to the skin of the lower lips and jaw\narea, but not the angle of the jaw (see Fig. 7.6 ).\nThe motor \ufb01bres of V run in the mandibular branch (V 3) and\ninnervate the muscles of mastication: temporalis, masseter and\nmedial and lateral pterygoids.\nExamination sequence (Video 9)\nFour aspects need to be assessed: sensory, motor and two\nre\ufb02exes.\nSensory\n\u0081Ask the patient to close their eyes and say \u2018yes\u2019each time\nthey feel a light touch (you use a cotton-wool tip for this test).\nDo this in the areas of V 1,V2and V 3.\n\u0081Repeat using a fresh neurological pin, such as a Neurotip, to\ntest super \ufb01cial pain.\n\u0081Compare both sides.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs in\nherpes zoster infection of the geniculate (facial) ganglion. This\nproduces a severe lower motor neuron facial palsy, ipsilateral loss\nof taste and buccal ulceration, and a painful vesicular eruption in\nthe external auditory meatus.

The\nglossopharyngeal (IX) nerve mainly carries sensation from the\npharynx and tonsils, and sensation and taste from the posterior\none-third of the tongue. The IX nerve also supplies the carotid\nchemoreceptors. The vagus (X) nerve carries important sensory\ninformation but also innervates upper pharyngeal and laryngeal\nmuscles. The main functions of IX and X that can be tested\nclinically are swallowing, phonation/articulation and sensation\nfrom the pharynx/larynx. In the thorax and abdomen, the vagus\n(X) nerve receives sensory \ufb01bres from the lungs and carries\nparasympathetic \ufb01bres to the lungs, heart and abdominal\nviscera.\nAnatomy\nBoth nerves arise as several roots from the lateral medulla andleave the skull together via the jugular foramen (see Fig. 7.5 ). The\nIX nerve passes down and forward to supply the stylophar-\nyngeus muscle, the mucosa of the pharynx, the tonsils and the\nposterior one-third of the tongue, and sends parasympathetic\n\ufb01bres to the parotid gland. The X nerve courses down in the\ncarotid sheath into the thorax, giving off several branches,\nincluding pharyngeal and recurrent laryngeal branches, which\nprovide motor supply to the pharyngeal, soft palate and laryngeal\nmuscles. The main nuclei of these nerves in the medulla are the\nnucleus ambiguus (motor), the dorsal motor vagal nucleus\n(parasympathetic) and the solitary nucleus (visceral sensation;\nFig. 7.13 ).\nExamination sequence (Videos 11 and 11A)\n\u0081Assess the patient \u2019s speech for dysarthria or dysphonia (p.\n211).\n\u0081Ask them to say \u2018Ah\u2019.

Normally, both sides of the palate\nelevate symmetrically and the uvula remains in the midline.\n\u0081Ask the patient to puff out their cheeks with their lips tightly\nclosed. Listen for air escaping from the nose. For the cheeksto puff out, the palate must elevate and occlude the naso-\npharynx. If palatal movement is weak, air will escape audibly\nthrough the nose.\n\u0081Ask the patient to cough; assess the strength of the cough.\u0081Testing pharyngeal sensation and the gag re \ufb02ex is unpleasant\nand has poor predictive value for aspiration. Instead, and in\nfully conscious patients only, use the swallow test. Administer3 teaspoons of water and observe for absent swallow, coughor delayed cough or change in voice quality after each\nteaspoon. If there are no problems, observe again while the\npatient swallows a glass of water.\nIsolated unilateral IX nerve lesions are rare. Unilateral X nerve\ndamage leads to ipsilateral reduced elevation of the soft palate,\nwhich may cause deviation of the uvula (away from the side of\nthe lesion) when the patient says \u2018Ah\u2019. Unilateral lesions of IX and\nX are most commonly caused by strokes, skull-base fractures or\ntumours. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal branch of the X\nnerve due to lung cancer, thyroid surgery, mediastinal tumours\nand aortic arch aneurysms causes dysphonia and a \u2018bovine \u2019\ncough. Bilateral X nerve lesions cause dysphagia and dysarthria,\nand may be due to lesions at the upper (pseudobulbar palsy) or\nlower (bulbar palsy) motor neuron levels (see Box 7.5 ). Less\nsevere cases can result in nasal regurgitation of \ufb02uids and nasal\nair escape when the cheeks are puffed out (dysarthria and nasal\nescape are often evident during history taking).

Wasting\nand weakness of the sternomastoids are characteristic of myo-\ntonic dystrophy.

Bilateral lower motor neuron damage results in global\nwasting; the tongue appears thin and shrunken and fasciculation\nmay be evident. Normal rippling or undulating movements may\nbe mistaken for fasciculation, especially if the tongue is pro-\ntruded; these usually settle when the tongue is at rest in the\nmouth. When associated with lesions of the IX, X and XI nerves,\ntypically in motor neuron disease, these features are termed\nbulbar palsy (see Box 7.5 ).\nUnilateral upper motor XII nerve lesions are uncommon;\nbilateral lesions lead to a tongue with increased tone (spastic),\nand the patient has dif \ufb01culty \ufb02icking the tongue from side to side.\nBilateral upper motor lesions of the IX \u2013XII nerves are called\npseudobulbar palsy (see Box 7.5 ).

Other parts of the ner-\nvous system, such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, have\nimportant modulating effects on movement. It is important todistinguish upper from lower motor neuron signs to help localise\nthe lesion ( Box 7.6 ).\nUpper motor neuron lesions\nIf the lesion affects the CNS pathways, the lower motor neurons\nare under the uninhibited in \ufb02uence of the spinal re \ufb02ex. The motor\nunits then have an exaggerated response to stretch withincreased tone (spasticity), clonus and brisk re \ufb02exes. There is\nweakness but not wasting (although atrophy may develop with\nlongstanding lesions). Primitive re \ufb02exes, such as the plantar\nextensor response (Babinski sign), may be present.\nLower motor neuron lesions\nMotor \ufb01bres, together with input from other systems involved in\nthe control of movement, including extrapyramidal, cerebellar,\nvestibular and proprioceptive afferents, converge on the cell\nbodies of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the grey\nmatter in the spinal cord (see Fig. 7.15 ).\nThe group of muscle \ufb01bres innervated by a single anterior horn\ncell forms a \u2018motor unit. \u2019A lower motor neuron lesion causes\nweakness and wasting in these muscle \ufb01bres, reduced tone\n(\ufb02accidity), fasciculation and reduced or absent re \ufb02exes.\nBasal ganglia lesions\nThe basal ganglia are connected structures within the cerebral\nhemispheres and brainstem ( Fig. 7.16 ). They include the caudate\nnucleus and putamen (collectively known as the striatum), globus\npallidus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra (the\nlatter in the brainstem). The basal ganglia receive much infor-\nmation from the cortex and are involved in regulating many ac-\ntivities, principally control of movement, but are also involved in\neye movement, behaviour and executive function control.

            "Text": "lesion in childhood may impair growth (causing a smaller limb or\nhemiatrophy) or lead to limb deformity, such as pes cavus.\nMuscle disorders usually result in proximal wasting (the notable\nexception is myotonic dystrophy, in which it is distal, often with\ntemporalis wasting). People in certain occupations, such as\nprofessional sports players, may have physiological muscle hy-\npertrophy. Pseudohypertrophy may occur in muscular dystro-\nphy, but the muscles are weak.\nFasciculation\nFasciculations are visible irregular twitches of resting musclescaused by individual motor units \ufb01ring spontaneously. This\noccurs in lower motor neuron disease, usually in wasted\nmuscles. Fasciculation is seen, not felt, and you may need to\nobserve carefully for several minutes to be sure that it is not\npresent. Physiological (benign) fasciculation is common,\nespecially in the calves, but is not associated with weakness\nor wasting. Myokymia \u2013\ufb01ne, involuntary fascicular contrac-\ntions \u2013involves rapid bursts of repetitive motor unit activity\nthat often affects orbicularis oculi or the \ufb01rst dorsal interosseus\nand is rarely pathological.\nAbnormal movements\nMyoclonic jerks\nThese are sudden, shock-like contractions of one or more\nmuscles that may be focal or diffuse and occur singly or repet-\nitively. Healthy people commonly experience these when falling\nasleep (hypnic jerks). They may also occur pathologically in as-\nsociation with epilepsy, diffuse brain damage and some neuro-\ndegenerative disorders, such as prion diseases. Negative\nmyoclonus (asterixis) is seen most commonly in liver disease\n(liver \ufb02ap).\nTremor\nTremor is an involuntary, oscillatory movement about a joint or a\ngroup of joints, resulting from alternating contraction and relax-\nation of muscles. Tremors are classi \ufb01ed according to their fre-\nquency, amplitude, position (at rest, on posture or movement)\nand body part affected.\nPhysiological tremor is a \ufb01ne (low-amplitude), fast (high-\nfrequency, 3 to 30 Hz) postural tremor. A similar tremor occurs\nin hyperthyroidism and with excess alcohol or caffeine intake and\nis a common adverse effect of beta-agonist bronchodilators.\nEssential tremor is the most common pathological cause of\ntremor; it is typically symmetrical in the upper limbs and may\ninvolve the head and voice. The tremor is noted on posture\nand with movement (kinetic). It may be improved by alcohol\nand often demonstrates an autosomal dominant pattern of\ninheritance.\nParkinson \u2019s disease causes a slow (3 to 7 Hz), coarse, \u2018pill-\nrolling \u2019tremor, worse at rest but reduced with voluntary\nmovement. It is more common in the upper limbs, is usually\nasymmetrical and does not affect the head, although it may\ninvolve the jaw/chin and sometimes the legs.Isolated head tremor is usually dystonic and may be associ-\nated with abnormal neck postures such as torticollis, antecollis or\nretrocollis.\nIntention tremor is absent at rest but maximal on movement\nand on approaching the target and is usually due to cerebellar\ndamage. It is assessed with the \ufb01nger-to-nose test (p. 158).\nOther causes of tremor include hereditary or acquired demy-\nelinating neuropathies (such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease)and are termed neuropathic tremors. Drugs commonly causing\ntremor include sodium valproate, glucocorticoids and lithium.\nMovement disorders, including tremor, are common functional\nsymptoms. They are often inconsistent and distractible with\nvarying frequencies and amplitudes and may be associated with\nother functional signs.\nOther involuntary movements\nThese are classi \ufb01ed according to their appearance.\nDystonia is caused by sustained muscle contractions, leading\nto twisting, repetitive movements and sometimes tremor. It may\nbe focal (as in torticollis), segmental (affecting two or more\nadjacent body parts) or generalised.\nChorea describes brief, jerky, random, purposeless move-\nments that may affect various body parts, commonly the arms.\nAthetosis is a slower, writhing movement, more similar to\ndystonia than chorea.\nBallism refers to violent \ufb02inging movements sometimes\naffecting only one side of the body (hemiballismus).\nTics are repetitive, stereotyped movements that may be brie \ufb02y\nsuppressed by the patient.\nTone\nTone is the resistance felt by the examiner when moving a jointpassively.\nExamination sequence (Videos 12A\nand 13A)\n\u0081Ask the patient to lie supine on the examination couch and to\nrelax and \u2018go\ufb02oppy. \u2019Enquire about any pain or limitations of\nmovement before proceeding.\n\u0081Passively move each joint to be tested through as full a range\nas possible, both slowly and quickly in all anatomicallypossible directions. Be unpredictable with these movements,\nin both direction and speed, to prevent the patient actively\nmoving with you; you want to assess passive tone. It may behelpful to distract the patient by asking them to countbackwards from 20 while assessing tone.\nUpper limb\n\u0081Hold the patient \u2019s hand as if shaking hands, using your other\nhand to support their elbow. Assess tone at the wrist and elbow\nwith supination/pronation and \ufb02exion/extension movements.\n\u0081Activation (or synkinesis) is a technique used to exaggerate\nsubtle increase in tone and is particularly useful for assessingextrapyramidal tone increase. Ask the patient to describe\ncircles in the air with the contralateral limb while you assess\ntone.

It may also be a feature of cerebellar disease or signal the\nearly phases of cerebral or spinal shock when the paralysed\nlimbs are atonic prior to developing spasticity. Reduced tone can\nbe dif \ufb01cult to elicit.\nHypertonia\nIncreased tone may occur in two main forms: spasticity and\nrigidity.\nSpasticity is velocity-dependent resistance to passive move-\nment; it is detected with quick movements and is a feature of\nupper motor neuron lesions. It is usually accompanied by\nweakness, hyperre \ufb02exia, an extensor plantar response and\nsometimes clonus. In mild forms, it is detected as a \u2018catch \u2019at the\nbeginning or end of passive movement. In severe cases, it limits\nthe range of movement and may be associated with contrac-\ntures. In the upper limbs, it may be more obvious on attempted\nextension; in the legs, it is more evident on \ufb02exion.\nRigidity is a sustained resistance throughout the range of\nmovement and is most easily detected when the limb is moved\nslowly. In Parkinsonism, this is classically described as \u2018lead\npipe \u2019rigidity. In the presence of a Parkinsonian tremor, there may\nbe a regular interruption to the movement, giving it a jerky feel\n(\u2018cog wheeling \u2019).\nClonus\nClonus is a rhythmic series of contractions evoked by a sudden\nstretch of the muscle and tendon. Unsustained ( <6 beats) clonus\nmay be physiological. When sustained, it indicates upper motor\nneuron damage and is accompanied by spasticity. It is best elicited\nat the ankle; knee (patella) clonus is rare and not routinely tested.Myotonia\nMyotonia refers to the inability of muscles to relax normally andcharacterises a group of neuromuscular disorders, the most\ncommon of which is myotonic dystrophy. Patients may noticedif\ufb01culty in letting go of things with their hands or a stiff gait.\nPower\nStrength varies with age, occupation and \ufb01tness. Grade muscle\npower using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale\n(Box 7.8 ). Record what patients can do in terms of daily activities;\nfor example, whether they can stand, walk and raise both arms\nabove their head. Lesions at different sites produce differentclinical patterns of weakness; examination will help discriminate\nupper from lower motor neuron lesions.\nExamination sequence (Videos 12B\nand 13B)\n\u0081Do not test every muscle in most patients; the commonly\ntested muscles are listed in Box 7.9 .\n\u0081Ask about pain that might interfere with testing.\n\u0081Observe the patient getting up from a chair and walking.\n\u0081Test upper limb power with the patient sitting on the edge of\nthe couch. Test lower limb power with the patient reclining.\n\u0081Ask the patient to lift their arms above their head.\n\u0081Ask them to \u2018play the piano. \u2019Check movements of the \ufb01n-\ngers; asymmetric loss of \ufb01ne\ufb01nger movement may be a very\nearly sign of cortical or extrapyramidal disease.\n\u0081Observe the patient with their arms outstretched and supi-\nnated (palms up) and their eyes closed for \u2018pronator drift, \u2019\nwhen one arm starts to pronate.\n\u0081Assess individual muscles depending on the history.

Look for patterns of\nweakness that may suggest a diagnosis. In pyramidal weakness\n\u2013after a stroke, for example \u2013the extensors in the upper limbs\nare weaker than the \ufb02exors, and vice versa in the lower limbs.\nMyopathies tend to cause proximal weakness and neuropathies\noften give rise to more distal patterns, while mononeuropathiesor radiculopathies lead to discrete focal weakness (such as a foot\ndrop caused by a common peroneal nerve palsy or L5\nradiculopathy).\nPatients may \ufb01nd it dif \ufb01cult to sustain maximum power for\nreasons other than weakness, most commonly pain. You need\nonly show that the patient can achieve maximum power brie \ufb02yt o\nbe satis \ufb01ed that the weakness is not neurological.

Wildly \ufb02uctuating or\nsudden \u2018give-way \u2019weakness suggests a functional explanation.\nHoover \u2019s sign ( Fig. 7.18 ) refers to the improvement of apparently\nweak hip extension when it is tested at the same time as\ncontralateral hip \ufb02exion (as hip \ufb02exion is associated with re \ufb02ex\ncontralateral hip extension) and is often present in functional leg\nweakness. This is helpful both diagnostically and therapeutically,as you can show patients that their leg is not actually weak using\nthis sign.\nDeep tendon re \ufb02exes\nAnatomy\nA tendon re \ufb02ex is the involuntary contraction of a muscle in\nresponse to stretch. It is mediated by a re \ufb02ex arc consisting of an\nafferent (sensory) and an efferent (motor) neuron with one syn-\napse between (a monosynaptic re \ufb02ex). Muscle stretch activates\nthe muscle spindles, which send a burst of afferent signals that\nlead to direct efferent impulses, causing muscle contraction.\nThese stretch re \ufb02ex arcs are served by a particular spinal cord\nsegment that is modi \ufb01ed by descending upper motor neurons.\nThe most important re \ufb02exes are the deep tendon and plantar\nresponses, whereas others, such as abdominal and cremasteric\nre\ufb02exes, are rarely tested and of questionable value. Dermatomal\ninvolvement may further help localise a lesion; for example, pain\ngoing down one leg with an absent ankle jerk (S1) and sensory\nloss on the sole of the foot (S1 dermatome) localises to the S1\nroot, most commonly due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc\n(sciatica).7.9Nerve and muscle supplies of commonly tested movements\nMovement Muscle Nerve and root\nShoulder abduction Deltoid Axillary C5\nElbow \ufb02exion BicepsaMusculocutaneous C5a/6\nBrachioradialis (supinator re \ufb02ex)aRadial C6a\nElbow extension TricepsaRadial C7\nWrist extension Extensor carpi radialis longus Radial (posterior interosseous branch) C6Finger extension Extensor digitorum communis Radial (posterior interosseous branch) C7Finger \ufb02exion Flexor pollicis longus (thumb)\nFlexor digitorum profundus (index and middle \ufb01ngers)Median (anterior interosseous branch) C8\nFlexor digitorum profundus (ring and little \ufb01ngers) Ulnar C8\nFinger abduction First dorsal interosseous Ulnar T1Thumb abduction Abductor pollicis brevis Median T1Hip\ufb02exion Iliopsoas Iliofemoral nerve L1/2\nHip extension Gluteus maximus Sciatic L5/S1Knee \ufb02exion Hamstrings Sciatic S1\nKnee extension Quadriceps\naFemoral L3a/4\nAnkle dorsi \ufb02exion Tibialis anterior Common peroneal L4/5\nAnkle plantar \ufb02exion Gastrocnemius and soleusaTibial S1a/2\nGreat toe extension (dorsi \ufb02exion) Extensor hallucis longus Common peroneal L5\nAnkle eversion Peronei Common peroneal L5/S1\nAnkle inversion Tibialis posterior Tibial nerve L4/5\naIndicates nerve root innervation of commonly elicited deep tendon re \ufb02exes.Motor system \u0081155\n7"

Diminished or absent jerks are most\ncommonly due to lower motor neuron lesions. In healthy older\npeople, the ankle jerks may be reduced or lost, and in Holmes-\nAdie syndrome, myotonic pupils (p. 180) are associated with loss\nof some re \ufb02exes. Isolated loss of a re \ufb02ex suggests a mono-\nneuropathy or radiculopathy, such as loss of ankle jerk with L5/\nS1 lumbosacral disc prolapse compressing the S1 nerve root.Re\ufb02ex patterns are helpful in localising neurological lesions, and\nyou should know the nerve roots that serve the commonly tested\nre\ufb02exes (see Box 7.9 ).

This is because the\nlesion at the C5/6 level affects the efferent arc of the biceps jerk\n(C5 nerve root), causing it to be reduced or lost, and also the\nspinal cord, increasing re \ufb02exes below this level (including the\n\ufb01nger jerks, C8). It is most commonly seen in cervical spondylotic\nmyeloradiculopathy.\nA Hoffmann \u2019sr e \ufb02ex and increased \ufb01nger jerks suggest hy-\npertonia; they may occur in healthy individuals but can be\ninformative if asymmetric.

Weakness may produce false-positive\n\ufb01nger-to-nose or heel-to-shin tests, so demonstrate that po-\nwer is normal \ufb01rst.\nDysdiadochokinesis (impairment of rapid alternating move-\nments) is evident as slowness, disorganisation and irregularity of\nmovement. Dysarthria and nystagmus also occur with cerebellar\ndisease. Much less reliable signs of cerebellar disease include the\nrebound phenomenon (when the displaced outstretched arm\nmay \ufb02y up past the original position), pendular re \ufb02exes and\nhypotonia.\nIn disorders predominantly affecting midline cerebellar struc-\ntures, such as tumours of the vermis and alcoholic cerebellar\ndamage, the tests described may be normal and truncal ataxia\n(that is, ataxic gait) may be the only \ufb01nding. In the most severe\ncases, this may mean that the patient cannot sit unsupported.Cerebellar dysfunction occurs in many conditions, and the dif-\nferential diagnosis varies with age and speed of presentation.\nApraxia\nApraxia, or dyspraxia, is dif \ufb01culty or inability to perform a task,\ndespite no sensory or motor abnormalities. It is a sign of higher\ncortical dysfunction, usually localising to the non-dominant\nfrontal or parietal lobes.\nExamination sequence (Video 12D)\n\u0081Ask the patient to perform an imaginary act, such as drinking\na cup of tea, combing their hair, or folding a letter and placingit in an envelope.\n\u0081Ask the patient to copy movements you make with your\n\ufb01ngers, such as pointing or making a V sign.\n\u0081Ask the patient to copy a geometric \ufb01gure (interlocking\npentagons or cube).\n\u0081Ask the patient to put on a pyjama top or dressing gown, one\nsleeve of which has been pulled inside out.\n\u0081Ask the patient to lie on the couch and perform cycling\nmovements with their legs.\nThe patient may be unable to initiate a task or may perform it in\nan odd or bizarre fashion. Constructional apraxia (dif \ufb01culty\ndrawing a \ufb01gure) is a feature of parietal disturbance. Dressing\napraxia, often associated with spatial disorientation and neglect,\nis usually due to parietal lesions of the non-dominant hemi-\nsphere. Patients with gait apraxia have dif \ufb01culty walking but are\nable to perform cycling movements on the bed surprisingly well.\nSensory system\nThe sensory system comprises the simple sensations of light\ntouch, pain, temperature and vibration, together with joint posi-\ntion sense (proprioception) and higher cortical sensations, which\ninclude two-point discrimination, stereognosis (tactile recogni-\ntion), graphaesthesia (identi \ufb01cation of letters or numbers traced\non the skin) and localisation.\nDetailed examination of sensation is time-consuming and un-\nnecessary unless the patient volunteers sensory symptoms or\nyou suspect a speci \ufb01c pathology, such as spinal cord\ncompression or mononeuropathy. In patients without sensory\nsymptoms, assessing light touch only of all four limbs as a\nscreening process may suf \ufb01ce. It is useful to have a working\nknowledge of the dermatomal distribution (a dermatome is an\narea of skin innervated by a single nerve root) and sensory dis-\ntribution of the more commonly entrapped peripheral nerves (see\nFigs 7.26 and 7.27 later).\nAnatomy\nProprioception and vibration are conveyed in large, myelinated\nfast-conducting \ufb01bres in the peripheral nerves and in the pos-\nterior (dorsal) columns of the spinal cord.

Assess these cortical sensory functions only if\nthe main pathway sensations are intact. Consider abnormalities\non sensory testing according to whether the lesion (or lesions) isin the peripheral nerve(s), dorsal root(s) or spinal cord, or is\nintracranial.\nPeripheral nerve and dorsal root\nMany diseases affect peripheral nerves, generally resulting in pe-\nripheral neuropathies or polyneuropathies. Peripheral neuropathies\ntend to affect the lower limbs, \ufb01rst starting in the toes. In these\nlength-dependent neuropathies, the upper limbs may become\ninvolved once the symptoms extend above the knees. Symptoms\n\ufb01rst affecting the upper limbs suggest a demyelinating rather than\naxonal neuropathy or a disease process in the nerve roots or spinal\ncord. In many cases, touch and pinprick sensation are lost in a\n\u2018stocking-and-glove \u2019distribution ( Fig. 7.25A ). There may also be\nautonomic involvement, causing symptoms affecting sweating,\nsphincter control and the cardiovascular system (such as ortho-\nstatic hypotension). In mononeuritis multiplex, different nerves in the\nupper and lower limbs can be affected in a stepwise fashion.\nIn\u2018large- \ufb01bre\u2019neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome,\nvibration and joint position sense may be disproportionately\naffected (reduced vibration sense at the ankle may be normal in\npeople over 60 years). Patients may report staggering when they\nclose their eyes during hair washing or in the dark (Romberg\nsign, p. 152). When joint position sense is affected in the arms,\npseudoathetosis may be demonstrated by asking the patient to\nclose their eyes and hold their hands outstretched; the \ufb01ngers/\narms will make involuntary, slow, wandering movements,\nmimicking athetosis. Re \ufb02exes will be absent or depressed.\nInterpretation of sensory signs requires knowledge of the rele-\nvant anatomy of sensory nerves and dermatomes ( Figs 7.26 and\n7.27 ). In \u2018small- \ufb01bre\u2019neuropathies, in which pain and tempera-\nture sensation are mainly affected, the only \ufb01nding may be\nreduced pinprick and temperature sensation; there may also be\nautonomic involvement. The most common causes worldwide\nare diabetes mellitus and HIV infection.\nSpinal cord\nTraumatic and compressive spinal cord lesions cause loss or\nimpairment of sensation in a dermatomal distribution below the\nlevel of the lesion. A zone of hyperaesthesia may be found in the\ndermatomes immediately above the level of sensory loss. Sy-\nringomyelia (a \ufb02uid-\ufb01lled cavity within the spinal cord) can result in\na dissociated pattern of altered spinothalamic (pain and tem-\nperature) sensation and motor function, with sparing of dorsalcolumn (touch and vibration) sensation.\nWhen one-half of the spinal cord is damaged, Brown \u2013S\u00e9quard\nsyndrome may occur. This is characterised by ipsilateral upper\nmotor neuron weakness and loss of touch, vibration and joint\nposition sense, with contralateral loss of pain and temperature\n(see Fig. 7.25B ).\nIntracranial lesions\nBrainstem lesions are often vascular, and you must understand\nthe relevant anatomy to determine the site of the lesion.

Try to localise the lesion to a single area of the\nnervous system if possible (Is the lesion in the CNS or PNS?)\nand then localise in more detail (e.g. if the lesion is in the PNS,\nis it in the root, nerves or neuromuscular junction muscle?).\nSome conditions, like multiple sclerosis, may give rise to\nmultiple symptoms and signs because they involve severallesions; others, like migraine or functional disorders, do not\nfollow strict neurological and anatomical rules.\nHaving localised the lesion, consider the likely underlying\npathology (What is the lesion?). This will depend on the history\n(e.g. syncope versus seizure; see Box 7.2 ), and also epide-\nmiology (sudden-onset leg weakness in a 72-year-old man\nwith diabetes and previous angina is unlikely to have the same\nexplanation as a new foot drop in a 20-year-old carpet \ufb01tter).\nDraw up a differential diagnosis and then consider which (if\nany) investigations are pertinent. Sometimes during the sum-\nmarising process, it may become clear that there are aspects\nof the history that have not been adequately addressed. Go\nback and resolve these areas. Time spent reviewing the his-\ntory is never wasted; undertak ing unnecessary tests, on the\nother hand, is more than just a waste of time.7.11 Common features of carpal tunnel syndrome\n\u0081It is more common in women.\n\u0081There is unpleasant tingling in the hand.\n\u0081It may not observe anatomical boundaries, radiating up the arm to the\nshoulder.\n\u0081Weakness is uncommon; if it does occur, it affects thumb abduction.\n\u0081Symptoms are frequently present at night, waking the patient from\nsleep.\n\u0081The patient may hang the hand and arm out of the bed for relief.\n\u0081There is thenar muscle wasting (in longstanding cases).\n\u0081It is commonly associated with pregnan cy, diabetes and hypothyroidism.164 \u0081THE NERVOUS SYSTEM"

            "Text": "Do not place undue emphasis on an isolated sign that fails to\n\ufb01t with the history, such as an apparently isolated extensor\nplantar response in a patient with typical migraine. It is more likely\nthat this is a false-positive sign due to an inept examination/\ninterpretation of a ticklish patient rather than an indication of\nunderlying pathology.\nInvestigations\nInitial investigations\nNot all patients require investigation. Most patients with headache,for example, need no tests, but some do (such as a 75-year-old\nman with new-onset headache and temporal tenderness on\nexamination, who should have urgent measurement of the\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein and a\ntemporal artery biopsy). Unfortunately, the increasing availability of\ntests means that many patients are investigated unnecessarily,\nwhich creates new problems (such as what to do with the inci-\ndental \ufb01nding of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm identi \ufb01ed in a\npatient with migraine). Avoid doing tests because you can or\nbecause you do not know what else to do; further investigations\nshould be guided by the history and physical examination. Mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may unearth incidental\n\ufb01ndings of no clinical relevance in up to 20%, depending on age,\nand there is an irony \u2013usually lost on your patient \u2013in attempting\nreassurance with a scan only to identify an incidental \u2018abnormality. \u2019\nSometimes a single carefully chosen test is all that is necessary to\ncon\ufb01rm a diagnosis. For example, a patient with chorea whose\nfather died of Huntington \u2019s disease will almost certainly have the\ndiagnosis con \ufb01rmed with genetic testing without the need for\nimaging or other tests.Consider your diagnosis and start with any necessary sim-\nple blood tests (such as exclusion of metabolic disturbance,\nincluding diabetes); then work upwards. If imaging is required,\ndecide what to image using which modality (computed to-\nmography, MRI, ultrasound or functional imaging) and whether\nany special sequences or techniques are necessary (like\nintravenous contrast; Figs 7.28 \u20137.30 ). Discuss the case with\nthe radiologists if you are unsure. For some PNS disorders,nerve conduction studies and electromyography may be\nhelpful. Electroencephalography is perhaps the most misused\ntest in neurology. Think carefully about whether it will add\nanything to what you already know; it should not be used to\ndiagnose epilepsy. The more invasive tests (lumbar puncture,\nnerve/muscle/brain biopsy) all require careful consideration\nand should be guided by specialists. Lastly, knowledge of\nantibody-mediated and genetic diseases is evolving rapidly, so\nyou may need to have a discussion with the relevant experts\nabout which specialised test might be most appropriate.\nSpeci \ufb01c investigations\nLumbar puncture\nLumbar puncture is a key investigation in a number of acute and\nchronic neurological conditions. Always measure the CSF\nopening pressure (in a lying position, not sitting), using an\natraumatic (blunt) needle. CSF is routinely examined for cells,\nprotein content and glucose (compared to simultaneously taken\nblood glucose); it is also stained and cultured for bacteria. Other\nspeci \ufb01c tests may be carried out, such as analysis for oligoclonal\nbands, meningococcal and pneumococcal antigens, polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) for certain viruses or cytology for malignant\ncells.\nA B\n C\nFig. 7.28 Imaging of the head.

The upper lid\nis elevated by two muscles: the levator palpebrae superioris,\ninnervated by cranial nerve III; and M\u00fcller \u2019s muscle, innervated by\nsympathetic nerves. The orbicularis oculi muscle closes both\nupper and lower eyelids and is innervated by cranial nerve VII.\nThe orbit also contains the six extraocular muscles responsible\nfor eye movement; the lacrimal gland; blood vessels; autonomic\nnerve \ufb01bres; and cranial nerves II, III, IV and VI, cushioned by\norbital fat ( Fig. 8.1 ).\nThe conjunctiva is a thin mucous membrane lining the inner\naspects of the eyelids and the anterior surface of the eyeball. It isre\ufb02ected at the superior and inferior fornices. The conjunctiva is\ncoated in a tear \ufb01lm that protects and nourishes the ocular\nsurface.\nEye\nThe eyeball is normally approximately 25 mm in diameter and\ncomprises three layers (see Fig. 8.1 ). These are:\n\u0081Outer \ufb01brous layer: this includes the white sclera and the clear\ncornea anteriorly.\n\u0081Middle vascular layer (uveal tract): anteriorly, this consists of\nthe ciliary body and the iris, and posteriorly, the choroid.\u0081Inner neurosensory layer (retina): the retina is a thin layered\nstructure responsible for transducing light to neurological\nsignals. There are two main types of photoreceptors: cones\nfunction maximally under photopic (light) conditions and\nenable colour vision while rods are primarily used in scotopic\n(dark) conditions. Cones are concentrated at the centre of the\nretina and are most highly concentrated at the centre of the\nmacula (the fovea). Photoreceptors transduce light intoneuronal signals that pass via bipolar cells and ganglion cells\nto the nerve \ufb01bre layer of the inner retina before entering the\noptic nerve.\nExtraocular muscles\nSix extraocular muscles are responsible for eye movement: (1)\nthe superior rectus, (2) medial rectus, (3) lateral rectus, (4)\ninferior rectus, (5) superior oblique and (6) inferior oblique. Each\nmuscle is responsible for a speci \ufb01c vector of eye movement\n(Fig. 8.2 ). They work together to move the eye in other\ndirections.\nCranial nerve III innervates the superior rectus, medial rectus,\ninferior oblique and inferior rectus muscles. Cranial nerve IV\ninnervates the superior oblique muscle, and cranial nerve VI\ninnervates the lateral rectus muscle. The cranial nerves origi-\nnate in the midbrain and pons and pass through the cavernous\nsinus ( Fig. 8.3 ). Examining for eye movement de \ufb01cits reveals\ncranial nerve de \ufb01cits.

The cornea accounts for approximately two-\nthirds of the refractive power of the eye while the lens provides\nadditional controllable refraction, allowing light to focus onto the\nretina at varying focal lengths. When light is precisely focused at\nthe retina, the eye is called emmetropic ( Fig. 8.4A ). When the\nfocus point falls behind the retina, the result is hypermetropia (see\nFig. 8.4B , long-sightedness). When the focal point is in front of the\nretina, the result is myopia (see Fig. 8.4C , short-sightedness).\nThese refractive errors can be corrected with lenses or partially\ncorrected with a pinhole (see Fig. 8.4D ).\nCavernous sinusArachnoid materSubarachnoid spaceThird ventricle Optic tracts\nAnterior cerebral arteries\nOculomotor nerve\nTrochlear nerve\nOphthalmic division\nof trigeminal nerve\nMaxillary division\nof trigeminal nerveTemporal\nlobeAnterior pituitary\nSphenoidal air sinuses\nInternal carotid arteries Abducens nerveDura mater\nFig. 8.3 Cavernous sinus (coronal view).

This will enable you to work from \u2018front to back \u2019to include or\nexclude differential diagnoses.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nStart the ophthalmic history with open questions so the patientcan describe their symptoms in their own words.

The most common symptoms are described\nbelow.\nChange in vision\nLoss or reduced vision is the most common change. Patients\noften describe blurred vision. Ocular disease is the most com-\nmon cause of a change in vision. Any intraocular condition that\nprevents light from activating retinal photoreceptors or the signal\nfrom photoreceptors reaching the optic nerve can cause alteredvision. Rarely, damage to the extraocular visual pathway may\ncause altered vision (see Fig. 8.5 ).\nWhen patients present with a change in vision, ask:\n\u0081Was the onset of visual change sudden or gradual? Sudden\nor gradual visual loss leads to speci \ufb01c differential diagnoses\n(Box 8.1 andFig. 8.7 ;Box 8.2 andFig. 8.8 ). If sudden, then\nenquire about possible causes (e.g. trauma, foreign body,\nchemical injury).\u0081Does the vision change affect one or both eyes? Sudden onset\nof bilateral change in vision suggests a post chiasmal cause.\n\u0081Is the change in vision associated with any additional features\n(e.g. haloes, \ufb02ashing lights, \ufb02oaters, distortion, discharge, red\neye, pain)? Haloes are bright or rainbow-coloured rings seen\nsurrounding a light source. They occur when there is corneal\noedema and are most commonly associated with angle-\nclosure glaucoma. Flashes and \ufb02oaters result from a distur-\nbance of the vitreous \u2013retinal interface, most commonly due to\na posterior vitreous detachment. This usually occurs with age\nas the vitreous degenerates, lique \ufb01es and peels away from the\nretina, resulting in \ufb02oaters. Detachment sometimes causes\nretinal traction, resulting in \ufb02ashing lights. More rarely, posterior\nvitreous detachment causes a retinal tear (releasing cells seen\nas\ufb02oaters), which may progress to retinal detachment with\nvisual \ufb01eld loss. Distortion is most commonly seen in diseases\nof the macula, such as age-related macular degeneration,\nepiretinal membrane, vitreous traction on the retina or central\nserous retinopathy.\n\u0081Does the change in vison affect part or whole of the visual\n\ufb01eld? If part, which part? Speci \ufb01c types of visual \ufb01eld loss\nmay point to retinal disease, such as macular degeneration,\noptic nerve disease such as glaucoma or visual pathway\ndefects (see Fig. 8.5 ).\nPain\nAsk:\n\u0081Can you describe the nature of the pain?\n\u0081How severe is it?\n\u0081Did anything cause the pain?\nA\n B\nC\nD\n E\n F\nFig. 8.7 Common causes of an acute change in vision.

            "Text": "Horner \u2019s syndrome\nHorner \u2019s syndrome results from a dysfunction of the sympathetic\nsupply to the eye. The sympathetic innervation of the eye origi-\nnates in the hypothalamus and emerges in the root of the neck\nbefore innervating the pupil (see Fig. 8.6B ). Damage at any\npoint along this pathway will result in Horner \u2019s syndrome. On\nexamination, the pupil will be constricted (loss of sympathetic\ndilator tone) and have a partial ptosis resulting from denervation\nof M\u00fcller \u2019s muscle in the upper eyelid (see Fig. 5.10 ,p .9 6 ) .\nThere may also be anhidrosis (loss of sweating) on the affected\nside.\nThe diagnosis of Horner \u2019s syndrome can be con \ufb01rmed by\nadministering drops of the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist apraclo-\nnidine to both eyes. This causes reversal of pupil constriction inthe affected eye and no change in the unaffected eye. This re-\nsults in a reduction of anisocoria (difference in pupil size between\nthe eyes). Causes of Horner \u2019s syndrome include demyelination,\nneck trauma/surgery, apical lung tumour (Pancoast tumour) and\ncarotid artery dissection.\nAdie \u2019s pupil\nAdie \u2019s pupil is a dilated pupil that responds poorly to both light\nand accommodation. With time, however, the affected pupil can\nbecome constricted. Adie \u2019s pupil is thought to result from\nparasympathetic pathway dysfunction in the orbit leading to a\nlack of pupil constriction. It typically affects young women and is\nbenign. When associated with diminished Achilles tendon re-\n\ufb02exes, it is referred to as Holmes-Adie syndrome.\nArgyll Robertson pupil\nArgyll Robertson pupils are bilaterally small and irregular and\nreact to near accommodation but not to light ( \u2018light-near disso-\nciation \u2019). These pupils are classically the result of neurosyphilis;\nhowever, they can also occur in diabetes mellitus, severe optic\nnerve disease and midbrain lesions.\nVisual \ufb01elds\nThe normal visual \ufb01eld extends 160 degrees horizontally and 130\ndegrees vertically. The physiological blind spot is located\napproximately 15 degrees temporal to the point of visual \ufb01xation\nand represents the entry of the optic nerve head into the eye.\nT h ea i mo ft h ev i s u a l \ufb01eld examination is to test the patient \u2019sv i -\nsual \ufb01elds against your own (assuming that you have normal visual\n\ufb01elds).

For an accurate assessment of the\npatient \u2019s\ufb01elds, it is vital that the testing \ufb01nger is always kept in a\nplane exactly halfway between yourself and the patient. Wiggle\nyour \ufb01ngertip and ask the patient to say when they \ufb01rst see it\n(Fig. 8.12 ).

This\nallows you to compare the patient \u2019s blind spot with yours.\nOcular alignment and eye movements\nThe eyes normally move in the same direction (conjugate\nmotion) in all positions of gaze except during convergence. Any\nmisalignment is referred to as a squint (strabismus). Squints\nare described as manifest (tropia) if present with both eyesopen or latent (phoria) if revealed only by covering one eye. In\naddition, they can be concomitant (where the angle of squint\nremains the same in all positions of gaze) or incomitant (where\nthe angle of squint deviation is greatest in a single position of\ngaze). The latter is commonly the result of extraocular muscle\nparalysis.\nDetection of a squint\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Sit directly facing the patient, approximately 1 metre away\nand at a similar height.\n\u0081Check visual acuity as part of the examination.\n\u0081Look for any abnormal head posture, such as head tilts (seen\nin cranial nerve IV palsy) or head turns (cranial nerve VI palsy).These signs may be subtle.\n\u0081Hold a pen torch directly in front of the patient and instruct\nthem to look at the light. Observe the re \ufb02ection of the light on\nthe cornea in relation to the pupil. The re \ufb02ections should be\nsymmetrical between the two eyes. Ask the patient if they seea single or double light. If they see double, this may indicate\nthe presence of a squint, but not seeing double does not\nexclude a squint. If the re \ufb02ection is on the nasal aspect of the\npupil in one eye, this suggests that the eye is deviated out-\nwards and is described as an exotropia.\n\u0081To con \ufb01rm the presence of a squint, perform the cover/un-\ncover test:\n\u0081Ask the patient to look at the pen torch at all times and\nthen cover one eye.\n\u0081Look at the uncovered eye for any movement. It may be\nhelpful to repeat this several times.\n\u0081Inward movement of the uncovered eye suggests that it\nwas positioned abnormally outwards and is described as\nan exotropia (divergent manifest squint).\n\u0081Conversely, if the eye moves outwards when the contra-\nlateral eye is covered, this suggests that it was abnormally\npositioned inwards and is described as an esotropia\n(convergent manifest squint).\n\u0081Repeat the cover/uncover test for the other eye.\n\u0081Failure of an eye to move despite an obvious corneal light\nre\ufb02ex may indicate that the eye has such poor vision that it\ncannot take up \ufb01xation or else it is restricted from moving.\n\u0081The alternating cover test involves covering the eyes alter-\nnately and quickly while the patient is \ufb01xated on the pen\ntorch. Leave the cover on each eye for about 2 seconds butmove between the eyes in less than 1 second. The move-ment is repeated multiple times.

            "Text": "EAR\nAnatomy and physiology\nThe ear is the specialised sensory organ of hearing and\nbalance; it is divided anatomically into the external, middle and\ninner ear.\nExternal ear\nThe external ear consists of the cartilaginous pinna, the externalauditory canal (cartilage in the lateral one-third, bone in the\nmedial two-thirds), and the lateral surface of the tympanic\nmembrane ( Fig. 9.1 ). Sound is collected and channelled by the\npinna and transmitted via the external auditory canal to the\ntympanic membrane. The external auditory canal has an elon-\ngated S-shaped curve; hence it is important to retract the pinna\nwhen examining the ear to see the tympanic membrane clearly.\nThe outer portion of the canal has hair and glands that produce\near wax, which forms a protective barrier.\nMiddle ear\nThe middle ear is an air- \ufb01lled space that contains the three bony,\narticulated ossicles: the malleus, incus and stapes. The eusta-\nchian tube opens into the middle ear inferiorly and allows\nequalisation of pressure and ventilation. Vibrations of the tym-\npanic membrane are transmitted and ampli \ufb01ed through the\nossicular chain and focus on to the smaller oval window on\nwhich the stapes sits (see Fig. 9.1B ). The malleus is attached tothe tympanic membrane and can be seen clearly on otoscopy\n(Fig. 9.2 ). The long process of the incus can also be visible oc-\ncasionally. The tympanic membrane has a \ufb02accid upper part\n(pars \ufb02accida), and it is important to look carefully in this area as\nthis is where a cholesteatoma (an invasive collection of kerati-\nnising squamous epithelium) can form. The chorda tympani\nnerve runs through the middle ear carrying taste \ufb01bres from the\nanterior two-thirds of the tongue; these \u2018hitch a ride \u2019with the\nfacial nerve, which runs through the mastoid bone in the wall of\nthe middle ear.\nInner ear\nThe inner ear contains the organs of hearing (cochlea) and bal-\nance (vestibular system). The vibration of the stapes footplate\nstimulates \ufb02uid within the cochlea, resulting in the movement of\nhair cells in the cochlea which are converted to electrical im-pulses along the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII).\nThe vestibular system helps maintain balance, along with vi-\nsual input and proprioception. The vestibular part of the inner ear\ncontains:\n\u0081The lateral, superior and posterior semicircular canals: these\nlie at right angles to detect rotational motion of their \ufb02uid\n(endolymph) in three planes.\n\u0081The utricle and the saccule: their hair cells are embedded in a\ngel layer containing small crystals (otoliths), which are subject\nto gravity and enable detection of head tilt and linear\nacceleration.\nSemicircular canal\nVestibular nerve\nCochlear nerve\nCochlea\nEustachian tubeAuditory ossicles\nMalleus Incus Stapes\n(on oval window)\nTympanic cavity\nTympanic membrane\nExternal auditory\nmeatusPinna\nEarlobe\nATriangular fossaHelix\nExternal\nauditory meatus\nTragus\nEarlobeConchaAntihelix\nB\nFig. 9.1 The ear.

An acoustic\nneuroma (a tumour of the vestibulocochlear nerve, cranial nerve\nVIII) needs to be considered in unilateral tinnitus or tinnitus with\nan asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.\nVertigo\nVertigo is a sensation of movement relative to one \u2019s surround-\nings. Rotational movements are most common, and patients\noften have associated nausea, vomiting, and postural or gait\ninstability. Vertigo can originate peripherally or, less often, cen-\ntrally (brainstem, cerebellum). Patients will often say they are\n\u2018dizzy \u2019when describing the illusion of movement that is vertigo. It\nis very important to clarify exactly what they mean by this.\nLightheadedness is not a vestibular symptom, but unsteadiness\nmay be.\nAsk about:\n\u0081duration and frequency of episodes\n\u0081aggravating or provoking factors (position, head movement)\u0081associated \u2018fullness in the ear \u2019during the episode (M\u00e9ni\u00e8re \u2019s\ndisease)\n\u0081associated focal neurology (cerebrovascular event)\n\u0081\ufb02uctuating hearing loss or tinnitus\n\u0081associated headaches, nausea or aura (migraine)\n\u0081previous signi \ufb01cant head injury; previous URTI.\n\u0081The most common causes of vertigo include benign parox-\nysmal positional vertigo (attributed to debris within the pos-terior semicircular canal), vestibular neuritis (also known as\nvestibular neuronitis, a viral or postviral in \ufb02ammatory disorder)\nand M\u00e9ni\u00e8re \u2019s disease (caused by excess endolymphatic\n\ufb02uid pressure). Other causes include migraine, cerebral\nischaemia, drugs and head trauma. Discriminating features\nare described in Box 9.3 .\nNystagmus\nNystagmus is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes,\nwhich can be horizontal, vertical, rotatory or multidirectional. It\nmay be continuous, paroxysmal, or evoked by manoeuvres such\nas gaze or head position. The most common form, \u2018jerk\nnystagmus \u2019, consists of alternating phases of a slow drift in one\ndirection with a corrective saccadic \u2018jerk\u2019in the opposite direc-\ntion. The direction of the fast jerk is used to de \ufb01ne the direction of\nnystagmus ( Box 9.4 ). Pendular nystagmus, in which there is a\nsinusoidal oscillation without a fast phase, is less common.\nNystagmus may be caused by disorders of the vestibular, visual\nor cerebellar pathway.\nPast medical history\nAsk about:\n\u0081previous ear surgery, trauma\n\u0081recurrent ear infections\n\u0081systemic conditions associated with hearing loss (such as\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis)\n\u0081any signi \ufb01cant previous illnesses, such as meningitis, which\ncan result in sensorineural hearing loss.\nDrug history\nThe aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as gentamicin), aspirin,\nfurosemide and some chemotherapy agents (cisplatin) are\nototoxic.\nFamily history\nSome causes of sensorineural hearing loss and otosclerosis are\ncongenital.

Children can also have\nprotruding ears that occasionally require corrective surgery\n(pinnaplasty). Trauma can result in a pinna haematoma (see\nFig. 9.4B ) and subsequent \u2018cauli \ufb02ower ear \u2019due to cartilage ne-\ncrosis if untreated. Trauma may also cause mastoid bruising\n(\u2018Battle \u2019s sign \u2019), suggesting a possible skull-base fracture. Le-\nsions on the pinna are relatively common and can be related to\nsun exposure; they include actinic keratosis, and basal cell and\nsquamous cell cancers (see Fig. 9.4C ).\nIf discharge is noted on otoscopy and the tympanic mem-\nbrane is intact, otitis externa is the likely cause ( Fig. 9.5A ). The\ncanal can reveal exostoses, abnormal bone growth due to cold\nwater exposure, often seen in surfers (see Fig. 9.5B ).\nScarring on the tympanic membrane (tympanosclerosis) can\nbe caused by previous grommet insertion or infections.Tympanic membrane perforations can be central or marginal,\nand the position and size of the perforation should be noted as a\npercentage ( Fig. 9.6A ). A severe retraction pocket of the pars\ntensa can mimic a perforation (see Fig. 9.6B ). A retraction of the\npars \ufb02accida can contain a cholesteatoma, which may cause an\noffensive discharge and erode the bony ossicles, resulting in a\nconductive hearing loss (see Fig. 9.5C ). Fluid behind the tym-\npanic membrane is called otitis media with effusion (OME, or\u2018glue ear \u2019,Fig. 9.7A ), and a \ufb02uid level may be seen (see\nFig. 9.7B ). This commonly affects children and can be treated\nsurgically with insertion of a ventilation tube or grommet (see\nFig. 9.6C ). If persistent OME is seen in adults, the postnasal\nspace needs to be examined by a specialist to exclude a lesion in\nthat site. Acute otitis media presents with pain; the tympanic\nmembrane can become in \ufb02amed (see Fig. 9.7C ), and may bulge\nand eventually perforate.\nTesting hearing (Video 19)\nWhispered voice test\nExamination sequence (Video 19A)\n\u0081Stand behind the patient.\n\u0081Start testing with your mouth about 15 cm from the ear you\nare assessing.\n\u0081Mask hearing in the patient \u2019s other ear by rubbing the tragus\n(\u2018masking \u2019).\n\u0081Ask the patient to repeat a combination of numbers and\nletters (e.g. 3-B-7).

There are three turbinates on each side of the nose,\nsuperior, middle and inferior, which warm and moisten nasal\nair\ufb02ow (Figs 9.13 and 9.14A ).\nOne important function of the nose is olfaction. The olfactory\nreceptors are situated high in the nose in the olfactory cleft. Ol-\nfactory \ufb01bres from the nasal mucosa pass through the cribriform\nplate to the olfactory bulb in the anterior cranial fossa.\nThe paranasal sinuses are air- \ufb01lled spaces in the skull. There\nare paired frontal, sphenoid, maxillary, and anterior and posterior\nethmoid sinuses. The anterior nasal sinuses (frontal, maxillary\nand anterior ethmoid) drain into the middle meatus (between the\nmiddle turbinate and lateral wall of the nose). The posterior\nethmoid and sphenoid sinuses drain into the sphenoethmoidal\nrecess (between the superior turbinate and nasal septum).\nThe history\nCommon presenting symptoms\nNasal obstruction\nAsk about:\n\u0081unilateral or bilateral obstruction\n\u0081associated symptoms (bleeding, swelling, pain).\nUnilateral nasal obstruction may be caused by anatomical\nblockage, such as a deviated septum possibly secondary to\ntrauma. Bilateral obstruction can be due to rhinitis (allergic or\nnon-allergic) or chronic rhinosinusitis with or without polyps.\nNasal discharge\nAsk about:\n\u0081unilateral or bilateral discharge (rhinorrhoea)\n\u0081purulent or clear nature\n\u0081anterior discharge or postnasal drip.\nClear, bilateral watery discharge suggests allergic or non-\nallergic rhinitis. Purulent discharge can point to acute bacterial\nrhinosinusitis or chronic rhinosinusitis. A unilateral, purulent\ndischarge in a child raises the possibility of a foreign body in the\nnose. Following a head injury, unilateral clear rhinorrhoea sug-\ngests a possible CSF leak secondary to an anterior skull-base\nfracture.\nEpistaxis (bleeding from inside the nose)\nAsk about:\n\u0081unilateral or bilateral bleeding\n\u0081frequency and duration of episodes\u0081provoking factors such as trauma, sneezing, or blowing or\npicking nose\n\u0081bleeding from the front or back of the nose.\nThe nasal septum has a very rich blood supply, particularly in\nLittle \u2019s area (anterior septum), which is a common site for\nbleeding. If bleeding is unilateral and associated with nasal\nobstruction and pain, the possibility of sinonasal malignancy\nshould be considered. In adolescent males with unilateral nasal\nobstruction and epistaxis, the rare diagnosis of juvenile angio \ufb01-\nbroma should be excluded on nasendoscopy by an ear, nose\nand throat specialist.\nSneezing\nAsk about:\n\u0081associated itchy, red eyes\n\u0081whether symptoms occur all year round, only during certain\nseasons, or during contact with allergens.\nSneezing is a protective sudden expulsive effort triggered by\nlocal irritants in the nose and is most commonly due to allergy or\nviral URTIs.\nDisturbance of smell\nAsk about:\n\u0081complete loss of smell (anosmia)\n\u0081reduced sense of smell (hyposmia)\n\u0081unpleasant smells (cacosmia)\n\u0081associated nasal symptoms such as obstruction and rhinor-\nrhoea, which may suggest rhinitis or nasal polyps\n\u0081recent head injury\n\u0081recent URTI.\nA sudden onset of anosmia can occur following a signi \ufb01cant\nhead injury or viral URTI due to damage to the olfactory epithe-\nlium. In \ufb02ammation and swelling in the nasal mucosa as a result of\nrhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal polyps usually cause\nhyposmia. Cacosmia is usually caused by infection in the nose or\nsinuses, or occasionally by a foreign body in the nose. Phan-\ntosmia describes olfactory hallucinations, which may occur in\ntemporal lobe epilepsy.\nNasal and facial pain\nNasal pain is rare, except following trauma. Facial pain can be\ncaused by a number of problems but is often incorrectly attrib-\nuted to sinusitis.

The oral cavity contains the anterior two-thirds of the\ntongue, the \ufb02oor of the mouth, the hard palate and the inner\nsurfaces of the gums and teeth ( Fig. 9.18 ). The tongue anteriorly\nhas \ufb01liform papillae containing taste buds, giving the tongue its\nvelvety texture. The circumvallate papillae are groups of taste\nbuds marking the boundary between the anterior two-thirds and\nposterior third of the tongue.\nSaliva is secreted into the mouth from the parotid, sub-\nmandibular and sublingual salivary glands ( Fig. 9.19 ). The\nparotid gland is situated anterior to the ear and has a super-\n\ufb01cial and deep lobe relative to the facial nerve that runs\nthrough it. The parotid duct opens into the buccal mucosa\nopposite the second upper molar. The submandibular gland\nlies anterior and medial to the angle of the mandible and its\nduct opens into the \ufb02oor of the mouth next to the frenulum of\nt h et o n g u e( s e e Fig. 9.18 ).\nThroat\nThe pharynx is a shared upper aerodigestive channel that runs\nfrom the anterior tonsillar pillar to the laryngeal inlet. The larynx\n(\u2018voice box \u2019) is responsible for phonation and has a protective\nfunction to prevent aspiration. It consists of two external carti-\nlages, the thyroid cartilage (Adam \u2019s apple) and the cricoid\ncartilage (prominence at the top of the trachea; see Fig. 10.1A).\nThe membrane between the two is called the cricothyroid\nmembrane; a cricothyroidotomy may be performed by an\nexperienced clinician at this site as an emergency procedure toobtain an airway. The sensory supply to the larynx is via the\nsuperior and recurrent laryngeal branches of cranial nerve X\n(vagus). The motor supply is mainly from the recurrent laryngeal\nnerve, which loops round the aortic arch on the left side and the\nsubclavian artery on the right. Due to its longer pathway, the left\nrecurrent laryngeal nerve is exposed to greater risk of damage\nduring surgery to the neck or thorax, or from an upper lobe lung\nlesion.\nTeeth\nIn children the 20 deciduous teeth erupt by 3 years.

            "Text": "Endocrine glands synthesise hormones that are released into the\ncirculation and act at distant sites. Diseases may result from\nexcessive or inadequate hormone production, target organ hy-\npersensitivity or resistance to the hormone. The main endocrine\nglands are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, gonads (testes and\novaries), parathyroids and the endocrine pancreas. With the\nnotable exception of the pancreatic islet cells (which release in-\nsulin) and the parathyroids, most endocrine glands are them-selves controlled by hormones released from the pituitary.\nSince hormones circulate throughout the body, symptoms\nand signs of endocrine disease are frequently non-speci \ufb01c,affecting many body systems ( Box 10.1 ). Often, endocrine dis-\nease is picked up incidentally during biochemical testing or\nradiological imaging. Careful history taking and examination are\nrequired to recognise characteristic patterns of disease. Thyroid\ndisease and diabetes mellitus are common and frequently fa-\nmilial; establishing a detailed family history is therefore important.\nSome less common endocrine disorders (such as multiple\nendocrine neoplasia) show an autosomal dominant pattern ofinheritance.\nTHE THYROID\nAnatomy and physiology\nThe thyroid is a butter \ufb02y-shaped gland that lies inferior to the\ncricoid cartilage, approximately 4 cm below the superior notch of\nthe thyroid cartilage ( Fig. 10.1A ). The normal thyroid has a vol-\nume of less than 20 mL and is palpable in about 50% of women\nand 25% of men. It features a central isthmus approximately\n1.5 cm wide, overlying the second to fourth tracheal rings, andtwo lateral lobes that are usually no larger than the distal phalanx\nof the patient \u2019s thumb. The thyroid may extend into the superior\nmediastinum and can be partly or entirely retrosternal. Rarely, it is\nlocated along the line of the thyroglossal duct, along which the\nembryological thyroid descends from the base of the tongue to\nits\ufb01nal position. Thyroglossal cysts can also arise from thethyroglossal duct, often at the level of the hyoid bone\n(Fig. 10.1A ); these characteristically move upwards on tongue\nprotrusion. The thyroid is attached to the pretracheal fascia and\nthus moves superiorly on swallowing or neck extension.\nThyrotoxicosis is a clinical state of increased metabolism\ncaused by elevated circulating levels of thyroid hormones.\nGraves \u2019disease is the most common cause ( Fig. 10.2 and\nBox 10.2 ). It is an autoimmune condition with a familial compo-\nnent and is 5 \u201310 times more common in women, usually pre-\nsenting between 30 and 60 years of age. Other causes include\ntoxic multinodular goitre, solitary toxic nodule, thyroiditis and\nexcessive thyroid hormone ingestion.\nHypothyroidism is caused by reduced levels of thyroid hor-\nmones, usually due to autoimmune Hashimoto \u2019s thyroiditis, and\n10.1 Common clinical features in endocrine disease\nSymptom, sign or problem Differential diagnoses\nTiredness Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism\nWeight gain Hypothyroidism, PCOS, Cushing \u2019s syndrome\nWeight loss Hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insuf \ufb01ciency\nDiarrhoea Hyperthyroidism, gastrin-producing tumour, carcinoidDiffuse neck swelling Simple goitre, Graves \u2019disease, Hashimoto \u2019s thyroiditis\nPolyuria and excessive thirst Diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism, Conn \u2019s syndrome\nHirsutism Idiopathic, PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing \u2019s syndrome\n\u2018Funny turns \u2019 Hypoglycaemia, phaeochromocytoma, neuroendocrine tumour\nSweating Hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, acromegaly, phaeochromocytomaFlushing Hypogonadism (especially menopause), carcinoid syndromeResistant hypertension Conn \u2019s syndrome, Cushing \u2019s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, acromegaly\nAmenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea PCOS, hyperprolactinaemia, thyroid dysfunctionErectile dysfunction Primary or secondary hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, non-endocrine systemic disease, medication-\ninduced (e.g. beta-blockers, opiates)\nMuscle weakness Cushing \u2019s syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia\nBone fragility and fractures Hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing \u2019s syndrome, primary hyperparathyroidism\nPCOS, Polycystic ovary syndrome.220 \u0081THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM"

It is not\nnecessarily associated with thyroid dysfunction; indeed, most\npatients with goitre are euthyroid.

A less common extrathyroidal\nmanifestation of Graves \u2019disease is thyroid acropachy, a soft\ntissue swelling and periosteal hypertrophy of the distal phalanges\nwhich mimics \ufb01nger clubbing (see Fig. 10.2C ). It is almost always\nassociated with dermopathy and ophthalmopathy.\nMany clinical features of hypothyroidism are produced by\nmyxoedema (non-pitting oedema caused by tissue in \ufb01ltration by\nmucopolysaccharides, chondroitin and hyaluronic acid;\nFigs. 10.4 and 10.5 ).

A thyroid\nbruit (sometimes associated with a palpable thrill) indicates\nabnormally high blood \ufb02ow and is most commonly associ-\nated with Graves \u2019disease. It may be confused with other\nsounds, but carotid bruits or murmurs transmitted from the\naorta are louder over the carotid artery.\nEarly simple goitres are relatively symmetrical but may become\nnodular with time. In Graves \u2019disease, the surface of the thyroid is\nusually smooth and the gland diffusely enlarged; in uninodular or\nmultinodular goitre, it is irregular (see Fig. 10.3 ). Diffuse tender-\nness is typical of viral thyroiditis. Localised tenderness may follow\nbleeding into a thyroid cyst. Fixation of the thyroid to surrounding\nstructures (such that it does not move on swallowing) and\nassociated cervical lymphadenopathy increase the likelihood ofthyroid malignancy. Further investigation of thyroid disorders is\nsummarised in Box 10.4 .\nEyes\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Look for periorbital puf \ufb01ness or oedema and lid retraction\n(this is present if the white sclera is visible above the iris in the\nprimary position of gaze; Fig. 10.2A ).\n\u0081Examine for features of Graves \u2019ophthalmopathy, including\nexophthalmos (look down from above and behind the pa-tient), lid swelling or erythema and conjunctival redness or\nswelling (chemosis; Fig. 10.2B ).\n\u0081Assess for lid lag: ask the patient to follow your index \ufb01nger as\nyou move it from the upper to the lower part of the visual \ufb01eld.\nLid lag means delay between downward movement of the\neyeball and descent of the upper eyelid, exposing the scleraabove the iris.\n\u0081Assess eye movements ( Fig. 8.9 , p. 189). Graves \u2019oph-\nthalmopathy is characteristically associated with restriction of\nupgaze.Lid retraction (a staring appearance due to widening of the\npalpebral \ufb01ssure) and lid lag (see above) are common eye signs\nassociated with hyperthyroidism. Both are thought to be due to\ncontraction of the levator palpebrae muscles as a result of\nsympathetic hyperactivity. Periorbital puf \ufb01ness (myxoedema) is\nsometimes seen in hypothyroidism.\nGraves \u2019ophthalmopathy is an in \ufb02ammatory in \ufb01ltration of the soft\ntissues and extraocular muscles which affects around 20% of pa-tients with Graves \u2019disease (see Fig. 10.2A and B). Features sug-\ngestive of active in \ufb02ammation include spontaneous or gaze-evoked\neye pain, and redness or swelling of the lids or conjunctiva. Prop-\ntosis (protrusion of the globe from the orbit) may occur in both\nactive and inactive Graves \u2019ophthalmopathy and is often called\nexophthalmos. In \ufb02ammation of the orbital soft tissues may lead to\nother more severe features, including corneal ulceration, diplopia,\nophthalmoplegia and compressive optic neuropathy ( Fig. 8.8 D).\nTHE PARATHYROIDS\nAnatomy and physiology\nThere are usually four parathyroid glands situated posterior to the\nthyroid (see Fig. 10.1A ).

Lateral to the pituitary fossa are the cavernous\nsinuses, containing cranial nerves III, IV and VI and the internal\ncarotid arteries ( Fig. 8.3 , p. 171). The gland comprises anterior and\nposterior lobes. The anterior lobe secretes adrenocorticotrophic\nhormone (ACTH), prolactin, growth hormone (GH), thyroid-\nstimulating hormone (TSH) and gonadotrophins (luteinising hor-\nmone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)). The posteriorlobe is an extension of the hypothalamus and secretes vasopressin\n(antidiuretic hormone) and oxytocin.\nThe history\nCommon presenting symptoms\nPituitary tumours are common and are found incidentally in around\n10% of patients undergoing head computed tomography (CT) or\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Presenting symptoms in men include loss of\nlibido, erectile dysfunction, loss of secondary sexual hair,\nreduction in testicular size and gynaecomastia.\nHyperandrogenism in women usually presents with hirsut-\nism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), acne and/or oligo-\nmenorrhoea and is commonly due to polycystic ovary\nsyndrome (PCOS; usually also associated with obesity). Other\nless common causes, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia,\nshould also be considered.

Always use non-judgemental, respectful\nand empathic language, and avoid labelling people as \u2018dia-\nbetic \u2019; most people prefer to be described as a \u2018person with\ndiabetes \u2019.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nNewly diagnosed diabetes mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus commonly presents with a classical triad of\nsymptoms:\n\u0081polyuria (and nocturia): due to osmotic diuresis caused by\nglycosuria\n\u0081thirst: due to the resulting loss of \ufb02uid\n\u0081weight loss: due to \ufb02uid depletion and breakdown of fat and\nmuscle, secondary to insulin de \ufb01ciency.\nOther common symptoms are tiredness, mood changes and\nblurred vision (due to glucose-induced changes in lens refrac-\ntion). Bacterial and fungal skin infections are common because of\nthe combination of hyperglycaemia, impaired immune resistance\nand tissue ischaemia. Itching of the genitalia (pruritus vulvae inwomen, balanitis in men) suggests Candida yeast infection\n(thrush).\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute complication of insulin\nde\ufb01ciency resulting in the production of ketone bodies and a\nconsequent metabolic acidosis and osmotic diuresis. It may occur\nas the \ufb01rst presentation of diabetes or can develop in people with\nexisting diabetes. It commonly presents with symptoms of\nhyperglycaemia (polyuria, thirst) alongside abdominal pain, vom-\niting and shortness of breath resulting from the underlying meta-\nbolic acidosis.

Monogenic\ndiabetes is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\nPatients are often slim (unlike those with type 2 diabetes) but\ndo not require insulin at diagnosis (unlike those with type 1\ndiabetes).

The\nhistory should cover any issues with daily glucose variability.\nClinicians have historically focused on HbA1c as a measure of\noverall glycaemic control, as lower values reduce the long-term\nrisk of complications of diabetes. However, for people living\nwith diabetes, the daily variability in glucose levels is often of\nmuch greater immediate importance. For example, hypo-\nglycaemia can affect the ability to exercise, drive or work.\nRecent advances in wearable technology which measure\ninterstitial \ufb02uid glucose (continuous glucose monitors or \ufb02ash\nglucose monitors; Fig. 10.12A ) make it easier for the clinician\nand the person with diabetes to have meaningful conversa-\ntions about glycaemic control as they provide more detailed\ninformation than intermittent or infrequent capillary blood\nglucose testing. Many patients link their data with their dia-\nbetes clinic, which supports virtual consultations. Clinicians\nshould routinely ask what the individual uses to measure theirglucose levels, how often they check these, and whether they\nhave identi \ufb01ed any particular problems that they wish to\ndiscuss.\nThe physical examination\nThe physical examination will differ, depending on whether this is\na new presentation of diabetes or a person with established\ndiabetes attending for annual review.\nAssessment of a person with newly diagnosed\ndiabetes\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Look for evidence of weight loss and dehydration.

            "Text": "BREAST\nAnatomy and physiology\nThe adult breast lies over the pectoralis major and serratus\nanterior muscles; it extends from the lateral border of the ster-\nnum into the lower axilla as the tail of Spence. The centre of the\nbreast is the nipple, which is composed mostly of smooth\nmuscle \ufb01bres. The areola is the pigmented skin around the nipple\nthat contains numerous Montgomery glands. The breast is\ndivided into four quadrants by two invisible lines running hori-\nzontally and vertically through the nipple ( Fig. 11.1 ). Accessory\nbreast tissue ( Fig. 11.2 ) is usually found in the axilla, whilst\naccessory nipples are most commonly seen just inferior to a\nnormal breast or above the groins.\nThe breast is composed of mammary glands, which are modi \ufb01ed\nsweat glands surrounded by connective tissue stroma\n(Fig. 11.3 ). The mammary glands consist of 15 \u201320 duct and\nlobular units that open individually onto the nipple-areolar com-\nplex. The connective tissue stroma has a \ufb01brous and a fatty\ncomponent. The \ufb01brous bands, called the suspensory ligaments\nof Cooper, anchor the breast tissue to the dermis and underlying\npectoral fascia and separate the secretory lobules of the breast.\nThe \ufb01brous stroma maintains the shape of the breast, while the\nfatty component contributes to the breast volume. Advancing\nage, body weight \ufb02uctuations and hormonal changes during\npuberty, menstruation, pregnancy and lactation can alter the\nconsistency and density of the breast, resulting in changes to\nbreast shape and volume.\nFour groups of lymph nodes drain each breast: supra-\nclavicular, infraclavicular, internal mammary and axillary. More\nthan 75% of the lymphatic drainage of the breast is to the ipsi-\nlateral axillary lymph nodes.\nThe history\nBreast symptoms affect all ages. Most patients present with asingle breast complaint, but it is not uncommon for patients tohave multiple breast concerns. The most common presenting\nsymptoms are breast lumps, breast pain and changes to the skin\nand nipples. Malignancy is more common as patients get older.Fat\nLobulesDuctsDilated section\nof duct to\nhold milk\nNipple\nNormal duct cells\nBasement membrane\nLumen (centre of duct)Chest wall/\nrib cage\nPectoralis\nmajor\nmuscle\nFig. 11.3 Cross-section of the female breast.Tail of Spence\nUpper outer\nLower innerUpper inner\nLower outer\nFig. 11.1 Adult right breast.\nFig. 11.2 Accessory breast tissue in the axilla.240 \u0081THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM"

On the other hand, a red, painful, swollen breast lump in\na patient who is breastfeeding would suggest lactational mastitis.\nFor each presenting symptom, it is important to establish the\nduration and progression of the symptom and any association\nwith the menstrual cycle.\nIn addition, ask about previous breast investigations, breast\nsurgeries, breast cancer diagnoses and treatments. Document\nany exposure to exogenous oestrogen, especially the use of\nhormonal replacement therapy. Previous mantle \ufb01eld radiation for\nthe treatment of lymphoma is also relevant.\nFamily history of cancer, especially breast and ovarian cancer,\nshould be established. Be speci \ufb01c about the degree of relatives\naffected and their age at diagnosis.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nBreast pain (mastalgia)\nAsk if the pain varies during the menstrual cycle (if relevant) and\nestablish the site, duration, severity and characteristics of the pain.\nBreast pain associated with the menstrual cycle (cyclical\nmastalgia) is commonest among young women. Non-cyclical\nmastalgia may suggest a non-breast origin, for example, the\nchest wall. Ask about the association of pain with arm move-\nments and the presence of underlying shoulder pathologies to\ndistinguish a non-breast cause.\nBreast lump\nA breast lump is the commonest reason for referral to a breastclinic. Many patients describe lumpiness or nodularity rather thana discrete mass. Patients may also present with an axillary lump.\nThe general approach to history taking is the same for all these\nscenarios.\nAsk:\n\u0081Is it a single lump or multiple lumps?\n\u0081When was it \ufb01rst noticed?\n\u0081Has it changed in size?\n\u0081Is there any relation to the menstrual cycle?\nEstablish:\n\u0081Any association with other symptoms, such as skin dimpling\nor nipple retraction?\n\u0081Any recent trauma to the breast?\nIn addition, for an axillary lump, establish:\n\u0081Any recent systemic illness?\n\u0081Any previous history of skin malignancy?\nThe commonest causes of an axillary lump are lymph nodes,\nskin lesions such as cysts, and accessory breast tissue.\nBreast volume and shape changes\nPatients may report a change in the size or shape of their\nbreasts. To quantify breast volume changes, it is best to ask thepatient if they have recently changed their bra size. In addition,\nask if the changes are:\n\u0081unilateral or bilateral,\n\u0081recent or longstanding\nBreast cancer surgery or treatment, especially radiotherapy,\nare likely to cause scarring that results in breast skin colour,\ntexture, shape and volume changes ( Fig. 11.4 ).\nBreast implant surgery is increasingly common, and changes\nto breast volume and shape may be a consequence of implant\nchanges, such as capsular contracture or implant rupture.\nSkin changes\n\u0081Ask about skin colour and textural changes and their site,\nduration and progression. Common descriptions of skin\nchanges used by patients include rash, dimpling, puckering and\nthickening. It is essential to understand what they are referring to\nand establish any association with other symptoms.\n\u0081Rash can be a sign of infection. It is important to establish\nif the patient has been treated with antibiotics and if the\nrash has responded to them. If not, further investigation is\nnecessary, as it may be a sign of in \ufb02ammatory breast\ncancer ( Fig. 11.5 ).\n\u0081\u2018Orange peel appearance \u2019or\u2018peau d \u2019orange \u2019describes\nthickened and dimpled breast skin ( Fig. 11.6 ).

Sec-\nondary or progressive dysmenorrhoea, due to underlying pa-\nthology such as endometriosis or chronic infection, often\nmanifests as pain that lasts beyond the normal menstrual cycle.\nInfection, pelvic adhesions and endometriosis can causegeneralised pain ( Box 11.4 ).\nDyspareunia is pain during intercourse. Ask if it is felt around\nthe vaginal entrance (super \ufb01cial) or within the pelvis (deep). Pain\ndue to an involuntary spasm of muscles at the vaginal entrance\n(vaginismus) may make intercourse impossible. Persistent deep\ndyspareunia suggests underlying pelvic pathology. Dyspareunia\ncan be due to vaginal dryness following menopause.\nIliac fossa pain in early pregnancy is commonly associated\nwith a corpus luteum cyst of the ovary but may indicate a tubal\nectopic pregnancy. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy results in\ngeneralised abdominal pain, peritonism, haemodynamic insta-\nbility and referred pain in the shoulder.\nAbdominal distension and bloating\nPelvic masses can cause non-speci \ufb01c symptoms like abdominal\ndistension, bloating or urinary frequency due to pressure on the\nbladder. They may also be asymptomatic and picked up during\nroutine abdominal or vaginal examination. Uterine masses\ninclude pregnancy and benign leiomyoma tumours ( \ufb01broids).\nLarge ovarian cysts can also be midline, and malignant ovarian\ncysts are associated with ascites.\nVaginal discharge\nDischarge may be normal and variable during the menstrual\ncycle. Prior to ovulation, it is clear, abundant and stretches like\negg white; after ovulation, it is thicker, does not stretch and isless abundant. Abnormal vaginal discharge occurs with infection.\nAsk about:\n\u0081consistency\n\u0081colour\n\u0081odour\n\u0081associated itch, pain or dysuria.\nThe most common non-sexually transmitted infection (caused\nbyCandida species) gives a thick, white, curdy discharge often\nassociated with marked vulval itching. Bacterial vaginosis is a\ncommon, non-sexually acquired infection caused by multiple\nbacteria, particularly Gardnerella vaginalis , producing a watery,\n\ufb01shy-smelling discharge. The pH of normal vaginal secretions is\nusually <4.5, but in bacterial vaginosis, it is >5. Sexually trans-\nmitted infections (STIs) can cause discharge, vulval ulceration or\npain, dysuria, lower abdominal pain and general malaise. They\nmay also be asymptomatic.\nUrinary incontinence\nInappropriate and involuntary voiding of urine is severe in 10% ofcases, and its prevalence increases with age.\nStress incontinence occurs on exertion, coughing, laughing or\nsneezing and is associated with pelvic \ufb02oor weakness.\nUrge incontinence is an overwhelming desire to urinate when\nthe bladder is not full due to detrusor muscle dysfunction.\nProlapse\nIn 30% of patients, the pelvic contents bulge into the vagina\n(Fig. 11.20 ). They feel something \u2018coming down \u2019, particularly\nwhen standing or straining. Uterine prolapse is associated with\nprevious childbirth and is classi \ufb01ed as:\n\u0081Grade 1: halfway to the hymen.\n\u0081Grade 2: at the hymen.\n\u0081Grade 3: beyond the hymen.\n\u0081Grade 4 (procidentia): external to the vagina ( Fig. 11.21 ).\n11.4 Characteristics of pelvic pain\nUterine pain Ovarian pain Adhesions or pelvic infection Endometriosis\nSite Midline Left or right iliac fossa Generalised lower abdomen; more on one\nsideVariable\nOnset Builds up before period Sudden, intermittent Builds up, acute on chronic Builds up, sudden\nCharacter Cramping Gripping Shooting, gripping Shooting, cramping\nRadiation Lower back and upper\nthighsGroin; if free \ufb02uid, to shoulder \u2013\u2013\nAssociated\nsymptomsBleeding from vagina Known cyst, pregnancy, irregular\ncycleDischarge, fever, past surgery Infertility\nTiming With menstruation May be cyclical Acute, may be cyclical Builds up during\nperiod\nExacerbatingfactors\u2013 Positional Movement, examination Intercourse, cyclical\nSeverity Variable in spasms Intense Intense in waves Variable248 \u0081THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM"

Otherwise, the focus of gynaecological examination is to\ndetect abnormalities that could explain the symptoms or alter\ntreatment options (e.g. body mass index (BMI) and blood pres-\nsure assessment affect the use of the contraceptive pill). Signs of\ngynaecological disease are not limited to the pelvis, and a gen-\neral, as well as a pelvic, examination is required ( Box 11.6 ). You\nshould offer a chaperone and record this in the records. The\nexamination area should be private, with appropriate equipment\nand an adjustable light source available. The patient should have\nan empty bladder and remove their clothing from the waist\ndown, along with any sanitary protection. Give them privacy to\ndo this.\nPassing a speculum\nExplain what you are going to do and why it is necessary, andobtain verbal consent.

This stops genuine stress incontinence.\nThe normal cervix os may be a slit after childbirth. The\nvaginal squamous epithelium and the endocervical columnar\nepithelium meet on the cervix. The position of this squamo-\ncolumnar junction varies considerably, so the cervix can look\nvery different in individual people. If the transition zone is on\nthe cervix, this is called an ectopy and looks red and friable;\nthere may be small cysts called Nabothian follicles. The normal\nuterus should feel regular and be mobile and the size of aplum. The Fallopian tubes cannot be felt, and normal ovaries\nare palpable only in the very slim.\nVulval changes include speci \ufb01c skin diseases, infections such\nas herpes or thrush, and malignancy. Visual abnormalities of the\ncervix such as ulceration or bleeding suggest cervical pathology,\nincluding polyps or malignancy. Tender nodules in the posterior\nfornix suggest endometriosis, and both endometriosis and pelvic\nadhesions cause \ufb01xation of the uterus. Acute pain when touchingthe cervix (cervical excitation) suggests an acute pelvic condition\nsuch as infection, cyst accident or tubal rupture.\nFibroids can cause uterine irregularity and enlargement. The\nsize is related to that of the uterus in pregnancy. A tangerine-\nsized uterus is 6 weeks, an apple at 8 weeks, an orange at\n10 weeks and a grapefruit at 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the\nuterus can be palpated suprapubically on abdominal palpation. A\nlarge midline mass may be ovarian or uterine. Push the massupwards with your left hand and feel the cervix with your right\nhand; if the mass moves without the cervix, this suggests it is\novarian.\nInvestigations\nCommon gynaecological investigations are summarised in\nBox 11.7 . Patients of reproductive age should be considered\npotentially pregnant, and a pregnancy test is routine. The\nmainstay of gynaecological investigation is a pelvic ultrasound\nscan, which can be carried out abdominally or transvaginally\n(Fig. 11.32 ). Endometrial biopsy is a common test, particularly for\nPMB, and is performed during vaginal examination using a\nsuction catheter (Pipelle, Fig. 11.33 ).

It results from\nrelaxation of the gastro-oesophageal sphincter and acid\nre\ufb02ux.\n\u0081Constipation, urinary frequency, nausea and vomiting (which\nusually resolve by 16 \u201320 weeks).\n\u0081Aches and pains, especially backache, carpal tunnel syn-\ndrome and pubic symphyseal discomfort.\nThese physiological symptoms affect patients to different de-\ngrees and will occasionally merit examination and investigation to\nexclude other problems. Secondary amenorrhoea is the most\nobvious symptom of early pregnancy.\nReduced fetal movements\nThis is a common emergency presentation or reason for referral\nto a hospital by a midwife, and merits a full history, examination\nand fetal monitoring. It can be a sign of fetal compromise.\nVaginal bleeding in pregnancy\nVaginal bleeding in pregnancy before viability may herald a\nmiscarriage; after 24 weeks, it is called an antepartum haemor-\nrhage. It can be a sign of a placental abruption, where the placenta\nprematurely separates, or of a low-lying placenta. At term, light\nvaginal bleeding can also be a sign of labour. Vaginal bleeding is\nnever considered normal in pregnancy and always merits hospital\nreview with a full history and examination. Painless bleeding is\nmore typical of local causes, such as a cervical polyp, or a low-\nlying placenta, whereas painful bleeding is more in keeping with\nplacental abruption. It is imperative to always consider venous\naccess and send blood for blood count and cross-matching in\nany pregnant woman presenting with vaginal bleeding.\nAbdominal pain\nAbdominal pain is common in pregnancy. It can be caused by\nbenign physiological issues such as constipation and is also a\ncommon presenting feature of labour when patients are con-\ntracting in established labour or tightening in early labour. It can\nalso be caused by polyhydramnios or placental abruption.\nAny condition causing abdominal pain can present coinci-\ndentally in pregnancy, however. A common example is urinarytract infection; less common causes include appendicitis, ovarian\ncyst accidents, sickle cell crisis or in \ufb02ammatory bowel disease. It\nis critical to take a complete history of a pregnant patient with\nabdominal pain and to perform a full obstetric and abdominal\nexamination, including renal angle palpation. This becomes more\ndif\ufb01cult as pregnancy progresses, and the expanding uterus\nmakes palpation of other organs and masses dif \ufb01cult. Ultrasound\nor MRI scanning may aid diagnosis.\nPre-eclampsia\nPre-eclampsia is a multifactorial syndrome comprised of high\nblood pressure, proteinuria and placental compromise, and is a\nsigni \ufb01cant cause of maternal and foetal morbidity. It is often\nasymptomatic and detected by blood pressure monitoring and\nurinalysis, although some patients develop generalised head-\naches and rapidly worsening peripheral oedema. A history\nfocused on headaches, worsening oedema and upper abdom-\ninal pain should be taken. The examination is that of a routine\nantenatal assessment but should also include a check for\nhyperre \ufb02exia and ankle clonus.\nPruritus\nPruritus (itching) affects one-quarter of pregnant patients. Rarely,\nit is associated with liver cholestasis, in which case it is gener-\nalised, and there is no rash.\nBreathlessness\nMild breathlessness is physiological in pregnancy. In rare cir-\ncumstances, increased breathlessness is due to pulmonary\noedema in pre-eclampsia or exacerbation of heart disease. If\nbreathlessness is associated with chest pain, a pulmonary em-\nbolism (p. 85) should be considered. The chest should be\nexamined, and oxygen saturation and respiratory rate measured.\nAn electrocardiogram is helpful, and the risks/ bene \ufb01ts of\nradiological imaging should be assessed. Consideration should\nbe given to an echocardiogram to exclude unknown congenital\nor acquired heart disease (e.g. cardiomyopathy).\nThe physical examination\nExamination sequence (Videos 23\nand 23A)\n\u0081Before examining the patient, ask them to empty their\nbladder (perform urinalysis). They should lie with their head ona low pillow, with their abdomen exposed from the symphysis\npubis to the xiphisternum.\n\u0081Examine patients in late pregnancy in the left lateral position\nor semirecumbent, 15 degrees to the horizontal, to avoid258 \u0081THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM"

If this discrepancy occurs or if theSFH centile is static or falling, the patient should be referredfor a growth scan ( Fig 11.37 ).\n\u0081In late pregnancy or labour, you need to assess the fetal lie,\nfetal presentation and engagement of the head in thematernal pelvis. The lie describes the longitudinal axis ofthe fetus related to the longitudinal axis of the mother \u2019s\nuterus. Most fetuses have a longitudinal lie in the third\ntrimester ( Fig. 11.38 ). From 36 weeks, a position other than\nlongitudinal is abnormal and requires further investigation.\n\u0081The presentation is the part of the fetus \u2019s body that is ex-\npected to deliver \ufb01rst. With a longitudinal lie, there is either a\ncephalic or a breech presentation. Finally, assess whethermore than 50% of the presenting part has entered the bony\npelvis.

They\nhave their own blood, lymphatic and nerve supply, so testicular\nproblems may cause abdominal pain and enlargement of the\npara-aortic lymph nodes. The scrotum is a pouch with thin,\npigmented, wrinkled skin that helps to regulate the temperature\nof the testes ( Fig. 11.43 ), as sperm production is most ef \ufb01cient\nbelow body temperature. The left testis lies lower than the right.\nEach testis is oval, 3.5 \u20135 cm long, and covered by the tunica\nalbuginea, which forms the posterior wall of the tunica vaginalis.\nThis is a prolongation of the peritoneal tube that forms as the\ntestis descends during development. If it persists, it may be\nassociated with an indirect inguinal hernia sac or a congenital\nhydrocoele. Along the posterior border of each testis is the\nepididymis.\nThe testes produce sperm and testosterone, starting at pu-\nberty (10 \u201315 years of age; see Fig. 15.19 ). Sperm mature in the\nepididymis and pass down the vas deferens to the seminal\nvesicles. They are ejaculated from the urethra, together with\nprostatic and seminal vesicle \ufb02uid, at orgasm.\nThe penis has two cylinders of endothelium-lined spaces\nsurrounded by smooth muscle, the corpora cavernosa\n(Fig. 11.44 ). These are bound with the bulbospongiosus sur-\nrounding the urethra, which expands into the glans penis. The\npenile skin is re \ufb02ected over the glans, forming the prepuce(foreskin). Sexual arousal causes a parasympathetically mediated\nincreased blood \ufb02ow into the corpora cavernosa with erection to\nenable vaginal penetration. Continued stimulation causes\nsympathetic-mediated contraction of the seminal vesicles and\nprostate, closure of the bladder neck and ejaculation. Following\norgasm, a reduction in blood in \ufb02ow causes detumescence.\nThe prostate and seminal vesicles contribute to seminal \ufb02uid.\nAfter age 40, the prostate develops a trilobar structure because\nRectum\nSeminal vesicle\nEjaculatory duct\nLevator ani muscle\nAnus\nBulbocavernosus\nmuscle\nTestisBladder\nSymphysis pubis\nProstate gland\nUrethra\nGlansHydatids of Morgagni\nEpididymis\nFig. 11.42 Anatomy of the male genitalia.

Dysuria (see below), voiding symptoms\nand haematuria are covered in Chapter 12 .\nPenile discharge or dysuria\nAsk about:\n\u0081the duration of discharge or dysuria\n\u0081whether these are new or recurrent symptoms\n\u0081any other urinary symptoms\n\u0081the sexual history\n\u0081any systemic upset.\nThese symptoms usually represent urethritis which is the result\nof either an STI or a urinary tract infection. They may precede and\nlead to epididymo-orchitis (see later) or prostatitis. Prostatitis is\nassociated with pelvic, perineal or scrotal pain, fever and sys-\ntemic upset in acute bacterial prostatitis, or may lead to chronic\npain and urinary symptoms in chronic prostatitis.\nScrotal swelling or pain\nPatients often present acutely with scrotal pain and swelling\ntogether; they may also, however, present with either symptom\nalone.\nAsk about:\n\u0081duration of the swelling\n\u0081whether it is unilateral or bilateral\n\u0081association with pain\n\u0081onset of pain: sudden or gradual\n\u0081character and duration of the pain\n\u0081radiation of the pain\n\u0081any history of trauma\n\u0081any associated symptoms:\n\u0081systemic upset (nausea, vomiting, fever or weight loss)\n\u0081urinary symptoms\n\u0081urethral discharge\n\u0081sexual history (see Box 11.5 ).\nThere are many causes of scrotal swelling or pain, but a pa-\ntient with sudden-onset unilateral scrotal pain should be\nconsidered to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise.\nTesticular torsion occurs most commonly between the ages of\n10 and 30 years and is very rare over the age of 40. Pain is\nusually of acute onset and excruciating; it is not relieved by lying\nstill. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting but not\nusually fever, lower urinary tract symptoms or urethral discharge.Glans penis\nUrethra\nCorpus cavernosumCorpus spongiosum\nCrus penis\nIschial tuberosity\nDorsal vein\nCorpus cavernosum\nCorpus spongiosum\nUrethra\nCross-section\nFig. 11.44 Anatomy of the penis.

            "Text": "Epididymo-orchitis is the most common differential diagnosis.\nThe pain of epididymo-orchitis is often more insidious in onset\ncompared to testicular torsion, and the patient may report a dull\nache initially. There may be associated fevers, dysuria or urethral\ndischarge, suggesting underlying STI or urinary tract infection.\nThe discomfort is often worse when standing or moving around\nand may be relieved when lying still. On examination, it is usually\npossible to distinguish the tender, in \ufb02amed epididymis from the\nadjacent testis. If testicular torsion cannot be excluded on history\nand examination, urgent testicular exploration is warranted, as\ntorsion will cause loss of a testis if not relieved within 4 \u20136 hours.\nWhile an ultrasound examination may be used to con \ufb01rm a\ndiagnosis of epididymo-orchitis, it should never be requested to\nassess for torsion.\nOther scrotal swellings include hernias, varicocoele, hydro-\ncoele, epididymal cysts and testicular tumours. These are usually\npainless, although vague or constant dull aches may be\ndescribed ( Fig. 11.45 ). Examination \ufb01ndings can usually differ-\nentiate these diagnoses ( Box 11.14 ).\nPenile skin lesions\nAsk about:\n\u0081location, duration and progression of the lesion\n\u0081any pain\n\u0081any problem retracting the prepuce\n\u0081any associated systemic upset\n\u0081any urinary symptoms\n\u0081any history of dermatological disease\n\u0081sexual history.\nThe inability to retract the foreskin (phimosis) is a common\nsymptom in the urology clinic. Phimosis may be normal, 95% of\nbabies are born with a non-retractile prepuce, but this usually\nresolves by the age of 16 years, when only 1% of boys havepersistent phimosis. This may produce balanitis (recurrent\ninfection of the glans penis), posthitis (infection of the prepuce) or\nboth (balanoposthitis).\nIf a tight foreskin is retracted and is not replaced, swelling and\npain ensue, resulting in paraphimosis due to the tight preputial\nband ( Fig. 11.46 ).\nDermatological conditions and drug reactions may affect the\ngenital skin. Painful genital ulcers are usually caused by herpessimplex; painless ulcers occur in reactive arthritis (p. 293), lichen\nsimplex and (rarely) syphilis. Genital warts may also be present,\nas well as penile carcinoma.\nErectile dysfunction\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to\nattain and/or maintain a penile erection suf \ufb01cient for penetrative\nintercourse.\nClarify from the history:\n\u0081Is the problem failure to gain or maintain an erection, painful\nerection, penile deformity on erection or a combination of these?\n\u0081How long has ED been a problem?\n\u0081Has the patient ever been able to gain a rigid erection?\n\u0081Do they ever have morning erections on waking?\n\u0081Are they able to gain an erection under any circumstances,\nsuch as masturbation?\n\u0081Do their problems prevent penetrative intercourse?Epidydimal cyst\nFig. 11.45 Swellings of the scrotum.11.14 Summary of examination \ufb01ndings in common\nscrotal pathologies\nInguinoscrotal: unable to \u2018get above \u2019\nInguinoscrotal hernia\n\u0081May be reducible and have a cough impulse\n\u0081Does not transilluminate\n\u0081May be associated with bowel sounds on auscultation\nHydrocoele\n\u0081Is not reducible\n\u0081Transilluminates\n\u0081Not associated with bowel sounds\n\u0081It is possible to palpate the normal cord above some hydrocoeles\nScrotal mass: able to \u2018get above \u2019\nEpididymal cyst\n\u0081Firm, well circumscribed and separate from testicular body\n\u0081Transilluminates\nTesticular tumour\n\u0081A hard, mass that may be well circumscribed or ill de \ufb01ned, arising\nfrom the testicular body\n\u0081Does not transilluminate\nVaricocoele\n\u0081Described as feeling like a \u2018bag of worms \u2019around the cord\n\u0081Present on standing or with a Valsalva manoeuvre but usually resolves\non lying \ufb02at264 \u0081THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM"

Assess cardiovascular, neurological\nand psychiatric comorbidities, as well as take drug history.\nIf the patient has never had an erection, they may have primary\nED due to an anatomical abnormality. Secondary ED is more\ncommon and may be psychological or organic in aetiology.\nPsychological ED may have a precipitating event, and loss of\nerection occurs in some but not all situations; early-morning\nerections or erections with masturbation usually remain unaf-\nfected. Organic ED affects all erections and is often associated\nwith medical comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, cardio-\nvascular disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,\nendocrine disorder or neurological disorder. ED is a common\nearly symptom of metabolic syndrome and should precipitate\nscreening for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nIf erections are painful or associated with deformity, the likely\ndiagnosis is Peyronie \u2019s disease. This is a \ufb01brotic condition of the\npenile shaft, of unknown aetiology, producing painful curvature,\nnarrowing or shortening of the corpora cavernosa with erection.\nIf the problem is a prolonged erection (priapism), establish the\nduration and whether it is painful. Particular attention should be\npaid to drug history, history of perineal trauma or past medical\nhistory of haematological, neurological or oncological disease.Painful (low- \ufb02ow or ischaemic) priapism is a urological emer-\ngency which requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent ED.Past medical history\nAsk about previous urological procedures, including neonatalsurgery. Record relevant general surgical procedures, particularly\npelvic operations that may contribute to lower urinary tract\nsymptoms, or ED. Cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, renal\nand psychiatric diseases may predispose or contribute to both\nurinary tract symptoms and ED.\nDrug history\nAsk about previous urological drug treatments and obtain a fulllist of all medications and drugs taken recreationally. In particular,\nnote drugs such as:\n\u0081diuretics: contribute to urinary symptoms\n\u0081alpha-blockers: may cause retrograde ejaculation\n\u0081antihypertensive agents: may cause erectile dysfunction\n\u0081vasoactive drugs, such as alprostadil: may result in a pro-\nlonged erection\n\u0081antidepressants or antipsychotics: may affect urinary and\nsexual function.\nSocial history\nSmoking, drinking alcohol and recreational drugs can affect\nfertility and sexual function. Smoking is a signi \ufb01cant risk factor for\nurological cancers.\nThe physical examination\nEnsure privacy. Use a warm, well-lit room with a moveable light\nsource. Explain what you are going to do and why it is neces-\nsary, and offer a chaperone. Record the chaperone \u2019s name; if\nthe offer is refused, record the fact. Apply alcohol gel and put on\ngloves. Allow the patient privacy to undress.\nAsk the patient to stand and expose the area from the lower\nabdomen to the top of the thighs. Initially, examine the patient\nstanding before asking them to lie on their back to re-examine\nany scrotal swellings while lying down.\nSkin\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Look in turn at the groin, skin creases, perineum and scrotal\nskin for redness, swellings or ulcers. Note the hairdistribution.\n\u0081If you see any swellings in the groin, palpate these and de \ufb01ne\nthem using \u2018SPACESPIT \u2019(see Box 3.8 in the 14th edition).\nA general examination may reveal a lack of secondary sexual\ncharacteristics suggestive of hypogonadism (p. 231).

Numerous uniform,\npearly penile papules around the corona of the glans are normal.\nWarts, sebaceous cysts, or a hard plaque of Peyronie \u2019s dis-\nease may occur on the shaft and phimosis, adhesions, in \ufb02am-\nmation or swellings on the foreskin or glans may be noted.\nScrotum\nExamine the scrotum with the patient standing. Then ask them to\nlie down if you \ufb01nd swelling you cannot \u2018get above \u2019. Ask the\npatient whether they have any genital pain. If they are cold or\napprehensive, the dartos muscle contracts, and you will not be\nable to palpate the scrotal contents properly.\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Inspect the scrotum for redness, swelling or ulcers, lifting it to\ninspect the posterior surface.\n\u0081Note the position of the testes and any paratesticular swelling\nand tenderness.\n\u0081Palpate the scrotum gently, using both hands. Check that\nboth testes are present. If they are not, examine the inguinal\ncanal and perineum, checking for undescended or ectopic\ntestes.\n\u0081Place the \ufb01ngers of both your hands behind each testis, in\nturn, to immobilise it, and use your index \ufb01nger and thumb to\npalpate the body of the testis methodically. Feel the anterior\nsurface and medial border with your thumb and the lateralborder with your index \ufb01nger ( Fig. 11.47 ).\n\u0081Check the size and consistency of the testis. Note any\nnodules or irregularities. Measure the testicular size in centi-\nmetres from one to the other.\n\u0081Palpate the spermatic cord with your right hand. Gently pull\nthe testis downward and place your \ufb01ngers behind the neckof the scrotum. Feel the spermatic cord and within it the vas,\nlike a thick piece of string.\n\u0081Decide whether a swelling arises in the scrotum or from the\ninguinal canal. If you can feel above the swelling, it originatesfrom the scrotum; if you cannot, the swelling usually origi-\nnates in the inguinal region ( Fig. 11.48 ).\n\u0081Check any inguinoscrotal swelling for a cough impulse and\nauscultate for bowel sounds.\n\u0081Place the bright end of a torch against a scrotal swelling\n(transillumination; Fig. 15.9 ). Fluid- \ufb01lled cysts allow light trans-\nmission, and the scrotum glows bright red. This is an incon-sistent sign, which does not differentiate a hydrocoele from\nother causes of intrascrotal \ufb02uid, such as a large epididymal\ncyst. With thick-walled cysts, transillumination may be absent.\nThe right testicle is usually closer to the inguinal canal than the\nleft, but the testes may be highly mobile (retractile). A normal\ntestis is 5 cm long. The normal epididymis is barely palpable,\nexcept for its head ( Fig. 11.49 ), which feels like a pea separate\nfrom the superior pole of the body of the testicle.\nSebaceous cysts are common in the scrotal skin. If you can\nget above a scrotal swelling, it is a true scrotal swelling. If not, it\nmay be a varicocoele, hydrocele or inguinal hernia that has\ndescended into the scrotum (see Fig. 11.45 ).\nVaricocoele\nA varicocoele is a dilatation of the veins of the pampiniform\nplexus and feels like a \u2018bag of worms \u2019in the cord when the\npatient is standing and should disappear when he lies down. If it\ndoes not, particularly on the left where the gonadal (testicular)\nvein inserts into the renal vein, consider a retroperitoneal mass\nsuch as renal cancer compressing the testicular veins.\nHydrocoele\nThese are swellings caused by \ufb02uid in the tunica vaginalis. They\nare usually idiopathic but may be secondary to in \ufb02ammatory\nconditions or tumours. They can be limited to the scrotum or\nextend into the inguinal canal.Fig. 11.47 Palpation of the testis.266 \u0081THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM"

They are\nisolated and adherent to the epididymis alone; they trans-illuminate and are never malignant. Painful swellings at the su-\nperior pole of the testis or adjacent to the head of the epididymis,\nare usually due to torsion of a paramesonephric duct remnant,\nthe hydatids of Morgagni.

Sometimes\nthe seminal vesicles are felt above the prostate.\nTenderness or soft \u2018bogginess \u2019suggests prostatitis or pros-\ntatic abscess.\nProstate cancer may cause a discrete nodule, a craggy mass\nor obliteration of the midline sulcus, and the prostate may feel\ufb01xed to the lateral pelvic sidewall.\nInvestigations\nThe relevant urological investigations depend on the clinical\nproblem revealed on history and examination. First-catch urinecan be tested for both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae from a single specimen using nucleic acid ampli \ufb01-\ncation tests, and this should be performed for all patients pre-\nsenting with urethritis or acute scrotal pain suspected to be due\nto epididymo-orchitis. Scrotal ultrasound is the gold standard for\ncon\ufb01rming the clinical diagnosis of scrotal swelling or pain, with\nthe exception of testicular torsion.\nWhen prostate cancer is suspected, a prostate-speci \ufb01c anti-\ngen (PSA) blood test should be requested. PSA is raised in\nprostate cancer but also increases with age, prostatic volume,\nfollowing prostatic trauma (including prostate examination or\nurinary tract instrumentation) and urinary tract infection. If the\nPSA is elevated, a multiparametric MRI scan of the prostate may\nbe considered with subsequent prostate biopsy to investigate for\nprostate carcinoma.\nEarly-morning testosterone should be measured in all patients\nwith erectile dysfunction to assess for hypogonadism. Serum alpha-\nf-etoprotein, beta-HCG and lactate dehydrogenase are tumour\nmarkers that may be raised in the presence of testicular cancer.\nOSCE example 1: Breast examination\nMs McIntyre, 27 years old, presents with a 6-week history of a lump in her right breast.\nPlease examine her breast\n\u0081Introduce yourself and clean your hands.\n\u0081Obtain verbal consent for the examination from the patient.\n\u0081Offer a chaperone.\n\u0081Ask her to undress to the waist and sit on the edge of the bed.\n\u0081Inspect for asymmetry, skin or nipple changes, or obvious lumps.\n\u0081Ask her to put her hands on her hips and push in while you look for changes in the breast.\n\u0081Ask her to lie on the couch with her upper body at 45 degrees.

            "Text": "Anatomy and physiology\nThe kidneys lie posteriorly in the abdomen, retroperitoneally on\neither side of the spine at the T12 \u2013L3 level, and are 11 \u201314 cm\nlong ( Fig. 12.1 ). The right kidney lies 1.5 cm lower than the left\nbecause of the liver. The liver and spleen lie anterior to the kid-\nneys. The kidneys move downwards during inspiration as the\nlungs expand.\nTogether, the kidneys receive approximately 25% of cardiac\noutput, and account for nearly 10% of basal metabolic rate. Each\nkidney contains about 1 million nephrons, each comprising a\nglomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and\ncollecting duct ( Fig. 12.2 ). Urine is formed by glomerular \ufb01ltration,\nmodi \ufb01ed by complex processes of secretion and reabsorption in\nthe tubules and then enters the calyces and the renal pelvis.\nThe primary functions of the kidneys are:\n\u0081Excretion of waste products of metabolism, such as urea and\ncreatinine\n\u0081Maintenance of salt, water, and electrolyte homeostasis\n\u0081Regulation of blood pressure via the renin \u2013angiotensin-\naldosterone system\n\u0081Endocrine functions related to erythropoiesis and vitamin D\nmetabolism\nThe renal capsule and ureter are innervated by T10 \u201312/L1\nnerve roots; pain from these structures is felt in these\ndermatomes.\nThe bladder acts as a reservoir. As it \ufb01lls, it becomes ovoid and\nrises out of the pelvis in the midline towards the umbilicus,\nbehind the anterior abdominal wall. The bladder wall contains a\nlayer of smooth muscle, the detrusor, which contracts under\nparasympathetic control, allowing urine to pass through the\nurethra (micturition). The conscious desire to micturate occurs\nwhen the bladder holds approximately 250 \u2013350 mL of urine. The\nmale urethra runs from the bladder to the tip of the penis and has\nthree parts: prostatic, membranous and spongiose ( Fig. 12.3 ).The female urethra is much shorter, with the external meatus\nsituated anterior to the vaginal ori \ufb01ce and behind the clitoris\n(Fig. 12.4 ). Two muscular rings acting as valves (sphincters)\ncontrol micturition:\n\u0081The internal sphincter is at the bladder neck and involuntary.\n\u0081The external sphincter surrounds the membranous urethra\nand is under voluntary control; it is innervated by the pu-\ndendal nerves (S2 \u20134).\nThe anatomy and physiology of the prostate are covered in\nmore detail on page 268.\nThe history\nRenal disease may be asymptomatic, or present with non-\nspeci \ufb01c symptoms, such as lethargy or breathlessness. It is\nusually only after initial investigation that the history-taking can be\nfocused on the possible renal causes.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nDysuria\nDysuria (pain or discomfort during urination) is a commonsymptom of urinary tract infection (UTI).

Stress\nincontinence is urine leakage with increased abdominal pressure\n(such as when coughing or sneezing or due to weakened pelvic\n\ufb02oor muscles), and urge incontinence is the urge to pass urine\nfollowed by involuntary leakage. These symptoms can occur\nseparately or together, and increase with age. Over \ufb02ow incon-\ntinence occurs without warning, often on changes in position,\nand is painless.\nPolyuria, the passing of higher volumes of urine, has a number\nof causes, including excess water intake, osmotic diuresis (as in\ndiabetes mellitus) and diabetes insipidus (inadequate secretion or\naction of vasopressin [antidiuretic hormone, ADH]).\nOliguria (passing of less than 500 mL of urine per day) and\nanuria (complete absence of urine) may be due to either very low\n\ufb02uid intake, mechanical obstruction or loss of kidney function\n(see later.)\nPneumaturia, passing gas bubbles in the urine, is suggestive\nof a \ufb01stula between the bladder and the colon from a diverticular\nabscess, malignancy or in \ufb02ammatory bowel disease.\nHematuria\nThe presence of blood in the urine is common. It may either be\nseen by the patient (visible haematuria) or be identi \ufb01ed by uri-\nnalysis or microscopy (non-visible).\nVisible haematuria\nVisible haematuria will be described as pink, red or brown in\ncolour. Ask about previous episodes, their time course andwhether they were persistent or intermittent. Haematuria can\nbe due to an underlying problem anywhere along the renal tract\nfrom the glomerulus to the bladder ( Fig. 12.5 ). Immunoglobulin\nA (IgA) nephropathy is the most common glomerular cause,\nwhich is often preceded by a non-speci \ufb01c upper respiratory\ntract infection. The haematuria associated with bladdertumours is usually painless and intermittent. This is the most\nimportant cause to exclude in patients over 45 years of age\nwithout a UTI.\nAsk about:\n\u0081Loin pain, as this may indicate ureteric obstruction due to\nblood, calculi, or a tumour; \ufb02ank pain and haematuria may be\nfeatures of renal cell carcinoma.\n\u0081Fever, dysuria, suprapubic pain and urinary frequency, which\nmay indicate urinary infection.\n\u0081Family history of renal disease; polycystic kidney disease can\npresent with visible haematuria due to cyst rupture.\nNon-visible haematuria\nNon-visible (or microscopic) haematuria is a dipstick urinalysis\nabnormality, with 1 \u00feconsidered positive. It can indicate renal or\nurinary tract disease. Non-visible haematuria in women of\nreproductive age is most commonly due to contamination by\nmenstrual blood.\nProteinuria and nephrotic syndrome\nProteinuria is the excretion of more than 150 mg of protein in the\nurine per day. It is usually asymptomatic but, if persistent, may\nindicate underlying renal disease.\nNephrotic syndrome is characterised by the combination of\nheavy proteinuria ( >3.5 g/24 hours), hypoalbuminaemia and\noedema. Nephrotic syndrome may come on over a few weeks (as\nin minimal change disease) and cause acute kidney injury (AKI), or\nit can evolve over many months (as in membranous nephropathy),\ngiving a picture of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The main presenting problems are\na decline in kidney function (usually identi \ufb01ed by routine blood\ntests), infection or malignancy. The risks of the latter two are\nincreased by immunosuppression. Infections in renal transplantpatients may be masked by immunosuppression. Lymphoma, in\nparticular, needs to be considered post-transplantation.\nAsk about:\n\u0081Date of transplant operation; organ rejection is more common\nin the \ufb01rst few weeks.\n\u0081Current and previous immunosuppression and any recent\nchanges in treatment that may increase the risk of rejection;\nany intercurrent illness that may have contributed to AKI.\n\u0081Fever, weight loss, cough, breathlessness, dysuria and\ntenderness over the graft.\nThe dialysis patient\nThere are two main forms of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritonealdialysis. Each group can have speci \ufb01c presentations. Haemodial-\nysis is delivered via an arteriovenous \ufb01stula or tunnelled vascular\naccess catheter. A \ufb01stula has an obvious thrill (p. 278), and the\npatient may complain that this has been lost. This is usually due to\nthrombosis and needs urgent attention from a vascular surgeon.\nThe most common problem with vascular access catheters is\ninfection. Peritoneal dialysis involves a tunnelled catheter, and\ninfection is also a common presentation. Ask about fever and rigors\n(and their relation to haemodialysis), abdominal pain and peritoneal\ndialysate \ufb02uid appearance (Has it become \u2018cloudy? \u2019).\nOther presenting symptoms\nFinally, hypertension, anaemia and electrolyte disorders are other\ncommon features of renal disease.\nPast medical history\nAsk the patient about their past medical history, including hy-\npertension, vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, in \ufb02ammatory\ndiseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, in \ufb02ammatory bowel dis-\nease, chronic infections), urinary tract stones or surgery and\nprevious evidence of renal disease, which may include dialysis\nand renal transplantation.\nDrug history\nEnquire about long-term medication, any recent changes in\ntreatment, recent courses of antibiotics and use of non-prescription medications, such as NSAIDs and herbal remedies.\nFamily history\nDocument any family history of renal disease, hypertension, stroke,\ndiabetes or deafness.

Inspect the nails, looking for Muehrcke \u2019s\nlines ( Fig. 12.6 ), which may be a sign of hypoalbuminaemia\n(nephrotic syndrome) or the half-and-half (Lindsay \u2019s) nails of CKD\n(proximal half white, distal half red or brown; Fig. 12.7 ).\nDialysis access\nExamine the arms for an arteriovenous \ufb01stula. This will look like\nprominent blood vessels on the forearm or upper arm ( Fig. 12.8 );\nthere may be scars from previous \ufb01stulae on either arm. A func-\ntioning \ufb01stula will have a readily palpable \ufb02uid thrill (a continuous\nbuzzing feel). A tunnelled venous access catheter may be seen\nexiting the anterior chest wall; the line can be followed under the\nskin before it enters the internal jugular vein ( Fig. 12.9 ).\nFace\nInspect the face for rashes, which may indicate underlying\nconnective tissue disease: the butter \ufb02y rash of systemic lupuserythematosus, for example. Look for conjunctival pallor, as\nanaemia is common in CKD. An in \ufb02amed eye, seen with scleritis\nand/or uveitis, may occur in systemic vasculitis. Fundoscopy\nmay reveal changes of diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy (see\nFigs 8.17 and 8.18). Most patients with CKD due to diabetes\nmellitus will have evidence of retinal disease. The presence of\nhypertensive retinopathy (such as arteriolar narrowing, arterio-\nvenous nipping, cotton-wool exudates or blot haemorrhages)indicates end-organ damage due to high blood pressure; more\nsevere fundoscopy signs, such as \ufb02ame haemorrhages and\npapilloedema, may indicate accelerated-phase hypertension,\nwhich can cause AKI. Inspection of the mouth may reveal\ngingival hyperplasia caused by calcineurin inhibitors (such as\nciclosporin or tacrolimus). Uraemic fetor may be present.\nSkin\nInspect the skin more generally for rashes, bruising, scratch\nmarks and excoriations. A vasculitic rash will appear as purpura,\nFig. 12.6 Muehrcke \u2019s lines. (From Short N, Shah C. Muehrcke\u2019s lines.

The JVP may\nbe elevated due to \ufb02uid overload or, rarely, due to cardiac\ntamponade from uraemic pericarditis.\nExamination of the chest\nExamine the chest for signs of pulmonary oedema and/or pleural\neffusion (p. 98); both are features of \ufb02uid overload. Auscultate the\nheart (p. 50), listening for a third heart sound, which providesfurther evidence of \ufb02uid overload. A fourth heart sound may\nindicate left ventricular stiffening due to hypertension. A \ufb02ow\nmurmur may be present in anaemia of chronic renal disease.\nQuiet heart sounds suggest a pericardial effusion. A pericardial\nrub may occur in uraemia.\nPeripheral oedema\nExamine for pitting oedema at the base of the spine (sacral\noedema, common in bed-bound patients) and in the legs,\nstarting at the ankles and noting the highest level at which\noedema can be identi \ufb01ed (such as midcalf, knees, or mid-\nthigh). In severe cases, oedema can extend into the scrotum\nor labia.

Expose\nthe abdomen fully down to the level of the anterior iliac spine.\nInspection\n\u0081Look for abdominal distension in the \ufb02anks (which may indi-\ncate ascites, a further marker of \ufb02uid overload, or large\npolycystic kidneys). Look for operative scars, such as thoserelating to a renal transplant in the left or right iliac fossa,\nextending inferiorly to the midline ( Fig. 12.11 ) and those of a\nprevious nephrectomy in the left or right \ufb02ank. A nephrectomy\nis often needed in patients with ADPKD to make space for asubsequent renal transplant. In addition, look for the pres-\nence of a peritoneal dialysis catheter.Palpation\n\u0081Kneel beside the bed and use your right hand, keeping the\npalmar surface \ufb02at. Observe the patient \u2019s face for signs of\ndiscomfort throughout. Palpate each region in turn, beginning\nwith light palpation followed by deeper palpation (p. 106 and\nFig. 6.1C). Describe any masses you feel. Examine forabdominal aortic aneurysm (p. 73).\n\u0081Signi \ufb01cantly enlarged kidneys are palpable as masses in the\n\ufb02anks. You should be able to \u2018get above \u2019the mass. Identi-\n\ufb01cation of less obviously enlarged kidneys requires deeper\npalpation and a ballotting technique. Starting on the right\nside, your left hand should be placed under the patient \u2019s\nback, with your index \ufb01nger against the 12th rib in the par-\namedian position; the right pushes \ufb01rmly down on the ante-\nrior abdominal wall. Ask the patient to take a deep breath,\nand push up by \ufb02exing the \ufb01ngers of your left hand\n(Fig. 12.12A ). The kidney can be felt against the \ufb01ngers of the\nright hand. The same procedure is followed on the left sidewith your left hand under the patient and your little \ufb01nger\nagainst the 12th rib (see Fig. 12.12B ). The procedure is\notherwise identical. ADPKD is the most common cause ofpalpable kidneys.\n\u0081A transplanted kidney may be palpated as a mass (usually\n12\u201314 cm in length) in either iliac fossa, although the right is\nmore common. Any tenderness should be noted, as this mayindicate graft pyelonephritis or rejection.\n\u0081A palpable bladder may be felt as a soft, midline, suprapubic\nmass that you cannot \u2018get below \u2019. In acute retention,\npalpation will worsen discomfort.\n\u0081When pyelonephritis is suspected, tenderness in the renal\nangle should be determined. If this is nontender on palpation,\nyou may sit the patient up and percuss with a closed \ufb01st over\nboth renal angles.\nPercussion\n\u0081Ascites should be assessed using the standard technique for\nshifting dullness or a \ufb02uid thrill (p. 124).

Urinalysis\n(see below) should be used to identify infection or intrinsic renaldiseases, such as glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome.\nIn patients with CKD, \ufb02uid balance assessment should be\npresented in the same way. The examination \ufb01ndings should\nfocus on whether there is evidence of an underlying disease that\nmay explain CKD: for example, diabetes mellitus (retinopathy,\nneuropathy), hypertension (retinopathy), ADPKD (enlarged kid-\nneys, previous surgery), renovascular disease (renal bruits) or\nprevious renal transplantation. In addition, include any features of\nthe adverse effects of CKD, such as anaemia, skin excoriations\nfrom pruritus or weight loss, in your presentation.\nInvestigations\nUrinalysis\nUrinalysis should be considered an essential part of the renalexamination.

Urine test strips contain up to 10 of these\nchemical pads; however, not all are used in the assessment of\nrenal disease. The key elements are described in Box 12.5 .Normal fresh urine is clear but varies in colour. Cloudy fresh\nurine is usually due to the presence of leucocytes (pyuria).\nDiscoloration of the urine can occur due to drugs (e.g. rifampicin),\nfoods (e.g. beetroot) or metabolites (e.g. bilirubin). Strong odours\ncan be due to infections; some foods, like asparagus, impart a\ncharacteristic smell to the urine.\nInvestigation of renal function\nFunctional studies may be useful in patients with voiding symp-\ntoms ( Box 12.6 ). In addition to urinalysis, there are a number of\nother blood and urine tests ( Box 12.7 ), as well as imaging studies\n(Box 12.8 ), that may help in the assessment of the patient with\nrenal disease.\n12.5 Key elements of urine dipstick test\nInvestigation Comment\nSpeci \ufb01c gravity Re \ufb02ects urine solute concentration; varies between 1.002 and 1.035; raised when kidneys actively reabsorb water (e.g. in \ufb02uid\ndepletion or renal failure due to decreased perfusion) abnormally low values indicate failure to concentrate urine\npH Normally 4.5 \u20138.0; in renal tubular acidosis, pH never falls to <5.3 despite acidaemia\nGlucose Small amounts may be excreted by normal kidneys. Glycosuria may indicate poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. It may occur in\nintrinsic renal disease when tubular glucose reabsorption is impaired.\nKetones Test is speci \ufb01c for acetoacetate and does not detect other ketones (e.g. b-OH butyrate, acetone). Ketonuria occurs in diabetic\nketoacidosis, starvation, alcohol use and very-low-carbohydrate diets.\nProtein Varies between trace and 4 \u00fe. The greater the degree of proteinuria, the more likely there is to be signi \ufb01cant renal disease. Most\npatients with nephrotic syndrome will have 4 \u00feprotein. The presence of both blood ( \u00152\u00fe) and protein ( \u00152\u00fe)dan\u2018active\nurinary sediment \u2019doften indicates intrinsic renal disease. As urinalysis is semiquantitative, con \ufb01rmatory laboratory quanti \ufb01cation\nshould be undertaken using either a urine albumin:creatinine or protein:creatinine ratio (see Box 12.4 )\nBlood \u00151\u00feis positive for non-visible haematuria. The test does not differentiate between haemoglobin and myoglobin. If you suspect\nrhabdomyolysis, measure myoglobin with a speci \ufb01c laboratory test.\nBilirubin and\nurobilinogenBilirubin is not normally present. Urobilinogen may be up to 33 mmol/L in health. Abnormalities of bilirubin and urobilinogen\nrequire investigation for possible haemolysis or hepatobiliary disease.\nLeucocyte esterase Indicates the presence of neutrophils in urine; seen in urinary tract infection or in \ufb02ammation, stone disease and urothelial cancers\nNitrite Most gram-negative bacteria convert urinary nitrate to nitrite. A positive result indicates bacteriuria, but a negative result does not\nexclude its presence.\n12.6 Functional assessment of the lower urinary tract\nFrequency/volume chart\n\u0081Chart is used to monitor micturition patterns, including nocturia, and \ufb02uid intake.\n\u0081The patient collects their urine, measures each void and charts it against time over 3 \u20135 days.\nUrine \ufb02ow rate\n\u0081The patient voids into a special receptacle that measures the rate of urine passage.\n\u0081A low \ufb02ow does not differentiate between poor detrusor contractility and bladder outlet obstruction.\nUrodynamic tests\n\u0081Invasive tests necessitating the insertion of bladder and rectal catheters to measure total bladder pressure and abdominal pressure and to allow bla dder\n\ufb01lling.\n\u0081Filling studies determine detrusor activity and compliance.\n\u0081Low detrusor pressures with low urine \ufb02ow suggest detrusor function problems.\n\u0081High detrusor pressures with low \ufb02ow suggest bladder outlet obstruction.282 \u0081THE RENAL SYSTEM"

Determine\nwhich component is painful: the joint (arthralgia), muscle\n(myalgia) or other soft tissue. Pain may be localised and may\nsuggest the diagnosis, for example, a red, hot, tender \ufb01rst\nmetatarsophalangeal joint in gout ( Fig. 13.2 ), or swelling ofseveral joints suggesting in \ufb02ammatory arthritis. Causes of\narthralgia and myalgia are shown in Boxes 13.1 and 13.2 .\nOnset\nPain from traumatic injury is usually immediate and exacerbated\nby movement. An affected joint may develop haemarthrosis\n(bleeding into the joint). In \ufb02ammatory arthritis can develop over\n24 hours or more insidiously. Crystal arthritis (gout and pseu-\ndogout) causes acute, severe pain that develops quickly, often\novernight. Joint sepsis causes pain that develops over 1 \u20132 days.\nCharacter\nBone pain can be described as a \u2018deep ache \u2019or\u2018penetrating \u2019\nand is characteristically worse at night. Common causes of\nlocalised pain are tumours, osteomyelitis (infection), osteonec-\nrosis or osteoid osteoma (a benign bone tumour). Generalised\nbony conditions, such as osteomalacia, more commonly cause\ndiffuse pain.\nPain from fractures is usually sharp and stabbing, aggravated\nby any movement and relieved by rest and splintage.\nMuscle pain may be described as \u2018stiffness \u2019or\u2018aching \u2019and is\naggravated by use of the affected muscle(s).Skin and\nsubcutaneous\ntissue\nBursa\nTendon\nMuscle\nBursaTendon sheath\nLigamentous\nthickeningof capsuleBone\nCapsule\nSynovium\nFibrocartilage pad\nJoint space\nArticular cartilage\nFig. 13.1 Structure of a joint and surrounding tissues.\nFig. 13.2 Acute gout of the \ufb01rst metatarsophalangeal joint.

If intermittent, with resolution\nbetween episodes, it may be palindromic rheumatism.\nExacerbating/relieving factors\nPain from joints damaged by intra-articular derangement orosteoarthritic degeneration worsens with exercise. Pain from\nin\ufb02ammatory arthritis worsens with rest. Pain from a septic joint is\npresent both at rest and with movement.\nSeverity\nApart from trauma, the most severe joint pain occurs in septic\nand crystal arthritis. Disproportionately, severe pain is seen\nacutely in compartment syndrome (increased pressure in a\nfascial compartment, compromising perfusion and viability of\ncompartmental structures) and chronically in complex\nregional pain syndrome. Neurological involvement in diabetes\nmellitus, leprosy, syringomyelia and syphilis (tabes dorsalis)\nmay impair joint sensation, reducing pain despite obvious\npathology on examination. G rossly abnormal joints may\neven be pain-free (e.g. Charcot joints, Fig 10.14C ,p .2 3 7 ) .\nPartial muscle tears are painful; a complete rupture may beless so.\nPatterns of joint involvement\nDifferent patterns of joint involvement aid the differential diag-\nnosis ( Fig. 13.3 ). Are the small or large joints of the arms or legs\naffected? How many joints are involved? Involvement of one joint\nis called monoarthritis; 2 \u20134 joints, oligoarthritis; and more than 4,\npolyarthritis.\u0081Predominant involvement of the small joints of the hands and\nfeet suggests in \ufb02ammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid\narthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\u0081Medium- or large-joint swelling is more likely to be degener-\native (osteoarthritis) or seronegative arthritis (such as psoriatic\narthritis).\n\u0081Nodal osteoarthritis particularly affects the distal interpha-\nlangeal (DIP) joints of the hands and the carpometacarpal(CMC) joint of the thumb.\nStiffness\nAsk what the patient means by stiffness. Is it:\n\u0081restricted range of movement?\n\u0081dif\ufb01culty moving, but with a normal range?\n\u0081painful movement?\n\u0081localised to a particular joint or more generalised?\nThere are characteristic differences between in \ufb02ammatory and\nnon-in \ufb02ammatory presentations of joint stiffness. In \ufb02ammatory\narthritis causes early-morning stiffness that takes at least 30 mi-\nnutes to wear off with activity. Non-in \ufb02ammatory, mechanical\narthritis causes stiffness after rest that eases rapidly on movement.\nDisease of the soft tissues rather than the joint itself may cause\nstiffness. In polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness commonly affects\nthe shoulder and pelvic areas.\nSwelling\nAsk about the site, extent and time course of the swelling.\nRheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Axial spondyloarthritis Osteoarthritis\nA BCD\nFig. 13.3 Contrasting patterns of joint involvement in polyarthritis.

            "Text": "The speed of onset of swelling is a clue to the diagnosis:\n\u0081Rapid ( <30 minutes), severe swelling suggests a haemarth-\nrosis ( Fig. 13.4B ). This occurs when vascular structures such\nas bone or ligament are injured and becomes worse in the\npresence of anticoagulants or bleeding disorders.\n\u0081Swelling over hours, or days, post injury suggests traumatic\neffusion, such as with a meniscal tear or articular cartilage\nabrasion.\n\u0081Septic arthritis develops over a few hours up to two days with\npain, marked swelling, tenderness, redness and extreme\nreluctance to move the joint actively or passively. Concurrent\nglucocorticoid or non-steroidal anti-in \ufb02ammatory drug ther-\napy suppresses these features.\n\u0081Crystal-induced arthritis (gout or pseudogout) can mimic\nseptic arthritis. It commonly starts overnight or early in the\nmorning due to the rise in serum urate following the evening\nmeal.Erythema and warmth\nErythema (redness) can occur with infective, traumatic andcrystal-induced conditions and may be present in in \ufb02ammatory\narthritis. All affected joints will be warm. Erythema associatedwith DIP joint swelling helps to distinguish DIP joint psoriatic\narthritis from the Heberden \u2019s nodes of osteoarthritis.\nWeakness\nWeakness suggests joint, neurological or muscle disease. The\nproblem may be focal or generalised.\nJoint disorders can cause weakness, either by inhibition of\nfunction due to pain or by disruption of the joint and its supporting\nstructures. Nerve entrapment may be a cause, for example, carpal\ntunnel syndrome at the wrist. Muscle disorders can produce\nwidespread weakness associated with pain and fatigue, such as in\nmyositis, and with a rash, as in dermatomyositis. Proximal muscle\nweakness can occur in endocrine disorders: for example, hypo-\nthyroidism or excess of glucocorticoids.\nLocking and triggering\n\u2018Locking \u2019is an incomplete range of movement at a joint because\nof an anatomical block. It may be associated with pain. Patients\nuse \u2018locking \u2019to describe various problems, so clarify exactly\nwhat they mean.\nTrue locking is a block to the normal range of movement caused\nby mechanical obstruction, typically preventing full extension, for\nexample from a loose body or torn meniscus, within the joint. The\npatient may be able to \u2018unlock \u2019the joint by trick manoeuvres.\nPseudolocking is a loss of the range of movement due to pain.\nTriggering is a block to the extension of a \ufb01nger, which then\n\u2018gives \u2019suddenly when extending from a \ufb02exed position. In adults,\nit normally affects the ring or middle \ufb01ngers and is caused by\nnodular or \ufb01brous thickening of the \ufb02exor sheath due to chronic\nlow-grade trauma. The cause may be occupational or associated\nwith in \ufb02ammatory arthritis. Triggering can also be congenital, in\nwhich case, it usually affects the thumb.\nExtra-articular symptoms\nPatients may present with extra-articular features of a disease\n(Box 13.5 ) that they may not connect with musculoskeletal\nproblems.\nAsk about:\n\u0081Rashes: occur with psoriasis, vasculitis, viral infections,\nconnective tissue diseases, sarcoidosis and auto-\nin\ufb02ammatory disease. Ask whether they are photosensitive\n(SLE, Box 13.6 ).\n\u0081Weight loss, low-grade fever and malaise: associated with\nrheumatoid arthritis and SLE.

Before palpating, ask the patient which area is painful\nor tender. Feel for warmth, swelling, stability and deformity.\nAssess if the deformity is reducible or \ufb01xed. Assess active before\npassive movement. Do not cause the patient additional pain.\nCompare one limb with the opposite side. Always expose the\njoint above and below the affected one.

This\nsection describes the detailed examination required for thorough\nevaluation.\nGait\nGait is the cyclical pattern of musculoskeletal motion that carriesthe body forwards. Normal gait is smooth, symmetrical and\nergonomically economical, with each leg 50% out of phase with\nthe other. It has two phases: stance and swing. The stance\nphase is from initial contact to toe-off, when the foot is on the\nground and load-bearing. The swing phase is from toe-off toinitial contact when the foot is off the ground. When both feet are\non the ground, this is a double stance.\nA limp, or antalgic gait, is an abnormal gait due to pain,\nstructural change or spasticity.\nExamination sequence (Video 24A)\n\u0081Ask the patient to walk barefoot in a straight line. Then repeat\nin shoes.\n\u0081Observe the patient from behind, in front and from the side.\n\u0081Evaluate what happens at each level (foot, ankle, knee, hip and\npelvis, trunk and spine) during both stance and swing phases.\nPain\nAn antalgic gait is one altered to reduce pain. Pain in a lower limb\nis usually aggravated by weight bearing, so minimal time is spent\nin the stance phase on that side. This results in a \u2018dot\u2013dash \u2019\nmode of walking. If the source of pain is in the spine, axial\nrotatory movements are decreased, resulting in a slow gait with\nsmall paces. Patients with hip pain may lean towards the affected\nside, as this decreases the joint reaction force in the hip joint.\nStructural change\nPatients with limb-length discrepancy may limp or walk on tiptoe\non the shorter side, with compensatory hip and knee \ufb02exion on\nthe longer side. Assess for limb-length discrepancy (see\nFig. 13.36 ). Other structural changes producing an abnormal gait\ninclude joint fusion, bone malunion and contracture.\nWeakness\nThis may be due to nerve or muscle pathology or altered muscle\ntone. In a normal gait, the hip abductors of the stance leg raise\nthe contralateral hemipelvis. In Trendelenburg gait, abductor\nfunction is poor when weight-bearing on the affected side, so the\ncontralateral hemipelvis falls (see Fig. 13.37 ).\nCommon causes of a Trendelenburg gait are:\n\u0081painful hip joint problems, as in osteoarthritis\n\u0081weak hip abductors, as in poliomyelitis or after hip\nreplacement\n\u0081structural hip joint problems, as in congenital dislocation.\nA high-stepping gait occurs in foot drop due to common\nperoneal nerve palsy. The knee is raised high to bring the weak\nfoot off the ground.\nIncreased tone\nThis occurs with upper motor neurone lesions, such as cere-\nbrovascular accident (stroke) or cerebral palsy. The gait depends\non the speci \ufb01c lesion, contractures and compensatory mecha-\nnisms (see Box 7.7 on p.

Thoracic spine disc lesions are rare but may cause\npain radiating around the chest, mimicking cardiac or pleural\ndisease. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can present with acute\npain or painless loss of height with increased kyphosis.\nVertebral collapse from malignancy may cause cord\ncompression. Infection causes acute pain, often with systemic\nupset or fever. With poorly localised thoracic pain, consider\nintrathoracic causes such as myocardial ischaemia or infarction,\noesophageal or pleural pain, and aortic aneurysm.\nThe physical examination\nExamination sequence (Video 26)\nAsk the patient to undress to expose their neck, chest and\nback.\nLook\n\u0081With the patient standing, inspect their posture from behind,\nfrom the side and the front, noting any deformity, such as arib hump or abnormal curvature (see Fig. 13.12 ).\nFeel\n\u0081Palpate the midline spinous processes from T1 to T12.

There are features of sensory andmotor disturbance, including diminished perianal sensation and\ndisturbance of bladder function. The motor disturbance may be\nprofound, as in paraplegia. Cauda equina syndrome and spinal\ncord compression are neurosurgical emergencies.\nAcute back pain in the middle-aged, elderly or those with risk\nfactors, such as glucocorticoid therapy, may be due to osteo-\nporotic fracture. This is eased by lying, exacerbated by spinal\n\ufb02exion and not usually associated with neurological symptoms.\nAcute onset of severe progressive pain, especially when\nassociated with malaise, weight loss or night sweats, may indi-\ncate pyogenic or tuberculous infection of the lumbar spine or\nsacroiliac joint. The infection may involve the intervertebral discs\nand adjacent vertebrae and may track into the psoas muscle\nsheath, presenting as a painful \ufb02exed hip or groin swelling.\nConsider a malignant disease involving a vertebral body in\npatients with unremitting spinal pain of recent onset that disturbs\nsleep. Other clues are a previous history of cancer, and systemic\nsymptoms or weight loss.\nChronic intermittent pain in the lumbar spine is typical of\ndegenerative disc disease. There is stiffness in the morning or\nafter immobility. Pain and stiffness are relieved by gentle activity\nbut recur with, or after, excessive activity.\nDiffuse pain in the buttocks or thighs brought on by standing\ntoo long or walking is the presenting symptom of lumbosacral\nspinal stenosis. This can be dif \ufb01cult to distinguish from intermit-\ntent claudication ( Chapter 4 , p. 70). The pain may be accom-\npanied by tingling and numbness. Typically, it is relieved by rest\nor spinal \ufb02exion. Stooping or holding on to a supermarket trolley\nmay increase exercise tolerance.\nThe physical examination\nExamination sequence\nAsk the patient to stand with their back fully exposed.\nLook\n\u0081Look for obvious deformity (decreased/increased lordosis,\nscoliosis) and soft-tissue abnormalities such as a hairy patchor lipoma that might overlie a congenital abnormality, forexample, spina bi \ufb01da.\nFeel\n\u0081Palpate the spinous processes and paraspinal tissues. Note\noverall alignment and focal tenderness.\n\u0081After warning the patient, lightly percuss the spine with your\nclosed \ufb01st and note any tenderness.\nMove (Fig. 13.14)\n\u0081Flexion: ask the patient to try to touch their toes with their legs\nstraight. Record how far down the legs they can reach. Someof this movement depends on hip \ufb02exion. Usually, the upper\nsegments \ufb02ex before the lower ones, but the progression\nshould be smooth.\n\u0081Extension: ask the patient to straighten up and lean back as\nfar as possible (normal 10 /C020 degrees from a neutral erect\nposture).\n\u0081Lateral \ufb02exion: ask them to reach down to each side,\ntouching the outside of their leg as far down as possible whilekeeping their legs straight.13.13 Clinical vignette: back pain\nA 34-year-old man attends his general practitioner \u2019s surgery with back pain.\nHe\ufb01rst developed pain in his late teens, but it improved for a few years. He has\nhad persistent pain in his lower back and sometimes in his buttocks for 5 years\nnow. It wakes him from sleep, and he can be very stiff in the mornings,\nalthough this eases as the morning progresses. There is no radiation to the leg.He is stiff after sitting or driving. He has always put it down to his occupation.He has used ibuprofen to good effect but has had diarrhoea and abdominal\npain recently, which he attributes to this drug. Examination in the outpatient\nclinic shows a thin man with reduced lumbar mobility (modi \ufb01ed Schober \u2019s\nindex, reduced at 2 cm; see Fig. 13.15 ), pain on sacroiliac joint compression,\nand tenderness at his Achilles insertion. Investigations show him to have a\nraised C-reactive protein, an anaemia of chronic disease, a positive human\nleucocyte antigen B27 and a raised faecal calprotectin, suggesting in \ufb02am-\nmatory bowel disease.

Movement also occurs\nbetween the scapula and the chest wall. The rotator cuff is\ncomposed of the supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor and\ninfraspinatus muscles. They and their tendinous insertions assist\nstability and movement, particularly abduction at the gleno-\nhumeral joint.\nThe history\nPain is a common symptom ( Boxes 13.15 and 13.16 ) and is\nfrequently referred to in the upper arm. Glenohumeral pain may\noccur over the anterolateral aspect of the upper arm. Pain felt at\nthe shoulder may also be referred from the cervical spine or\ndiaphragmatic and subdiaphragmatic peritoneum via the phrenic\nnerve. The most common cause of referred pain is cervical\nspondylosis, where disc-space narrowing and osteophytes\ncause nerve root impingement and in \ufb02ammation.\nStiffness and limitation of movement around the shoulder,\ncaused by adhesive capsulitis of the glenohumeral joint, is\ncommon after immobilisation or disuse following injury or stroke.\nThis is also termed \u2018frozen shoulder \u2019. However, movement can\nstill occur between the scapula and chest wall.\nSome rotator cuff disorders, especially impingement syn-\ndromes and tears, present with a painful arc where abduction of\nthe arm between 60 and 120 degrees causes discomfort\n(Fig. 13.27 ).The physical examination\nExamination sequence (Video 28)\nAsk the patient to sit or stand and expose their shoulder\ncompletely.\nLook\nExamine from the front and back, and in the axilla, for:\n\u0081Deformity: Deformities of the anterior glenohumeral and\ncomplete acromioclavicular joint dislocation should be visible\n(Fig. 13.28 ), but the shoulder contour in posterior gleno-\nhumeral dislocation may appear abnormal only when you\nstand above the seated patient and look down on the\nshoulder.13.15 Causes of shoulder girdle pain\nRotator cuff\n\u0081Degeneration\n\u0081Tendon rupture\u0081Tendonitis\n\u0081Calci \ufb01cation\nSubacromial bursa\n\u0081In\ufb02ammation due to in \ufb02ammatory arthritis,\ninjury or overuse\u0081Calci \ufb01cation\nCapsule\n\u0081In\ufb02ammation (Adhesive capsulitis,\npolymyalgia rheumatica)\nHead of humerus\n\u0081Tumour\n\u0081Osteonecrosis\u0081Fracture/dislocation\nJoints\n\u0081Glenohumeral, sternoclavicular:\n\u0081In\ufb02ammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis,\ndislocation, infection\u0081Acromioclavicular:\n\u0081Subluxation,\nosteoarthritis\n13.16 Common conditions affecting the shoulder\nNon-trauma\n\u0081Rotator cuff syndromes( e.g.\nsupraspinatus) infraspinatus tendonitis\n\u0081Impingement syndromes (involving the\nrotator cuff and subacromial bursa)\u0081Adhesive capsulitis\n(\u2018frozen shoulder \u2019)\n\u0081Calci \ufb01c tendonitis\n\u0081Bicipital tendonitis\n\u0081In\ufb02ammatory arthritis\n\u0081Polymyalgia rheumatica\nTrauma\n\u0081Rotator cuff tear\n\u0081Glenohumeral dislocation\n\u0081Acromioclavicular dislocation\u0081Fracture of the clavicle\n\u0081Fracture of the head or\nneck of the humerusDetailed examination of the musculoskeletal system \u0081307\n13"

The knee depends on its muscular and\nligamentous structures for stability ( Fig. 13.39 ).\nThe hamstring muscles are primary \ufb02exors of the knee.\nExtension is provided by the extensor apparatus, comprisingquadriceps muscles, quadriceps tendon, patella, patellar\ntendon and tibial tuberosity. Any disruption of this \u2018extensor\napparatus \u2019prevents straight-leg raising or produces an extensor\nlag (a difference between active and passive ranges of\nextension).\nThe medial and lateral collateral ligaments resist valgus and varus\nstress, respectively. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevents\nanterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur, and the posteriorcruciate ligament resists posterior translation. The medial and lateral\nmenisci are crescentic \ufb01brocartilaginous structures that lie between\nthe tibial articular surface and the femoral condyles. There are\nseveral important bursae around the knee:\n\u0081anteriorly: the suprapatellar, prepatellar (between the patella\nand the overlying skin) and infrapatellar bursae (between the\nskin and the tibial tuberosity/patellar ligament)\n\u0081posteriorly: several bursae lie in the popliteal fossa (see\nFig. 13.39D ).\nThe history\nPain\nGeneralised knee pain is likely to originate from pathology in the\ntibiofemoral joint. Anterior knee pain, particularly after prolonged\nsitting or going downstairs, suggests patellofemoral joint pa-\nthology. Medial or lateral pain could come from the collateral\nligaments or meniscal tears.\nKeep in mind that pain in the knee may be referred pain from\nthe hip.\nTake a detailed history of the mechanism of any injury. The\ndirection of impact, load and deformation predict which struc-\ntures are injured.\nSwelling\nThe normal volume of synovial \ufb02uid is 1 \u20132 mL and is clinically un-\ndetectable. An effusion indicates intra-articular pathology. Hae-\nmarthrosis (bleeding into the knee) is caused by injury to a vascular\nstructure within the joint, such as a torn cruciate ligament or an intra-\narticular fracture. The menisci are predominantly avascular and do\nnot cause a haemarthrosis, unless torn at their periphery or in\nconjunction with some other internal derangement. The speed of\nonset of any effusion is important in suggesting a potential cause.\nLocking\nCommon causes of locking in the knee are a meniscal tear, a\nloose body (e.g. from osteochondritis dissecans), osteoarthritis or\nsynovial chondromatosis. Bucket-handle and anterior beak\nmeniscal tears are especially associated with locking. Posterior\nhorn tears commonly cause pain and limit movement in the last\nfew degrees of \ufb02exion. Meniscal tears also cause local joint-line\ntenderness. Congenital discoid meniscus may present with lock-ing and clunking.\nInstability ( \u2018giving way \u2019)\nAny of the four main ligaments may rupture from trauma or\nbecome incompetent with degenerative disease. The patella is\nprone to dislocation laterally because the normal knee has a\nvalgus angle.Apparent length of leg\nTrue length of legAnterior superior iliac spine\nMedial malleolus\nFig. 13.37 True and apparent lengths of the lower limbs.\nFig. 13.38 Trendelenburg \u2019s sign.

To assess hyperex-\ntension in the patient, lift both of the patient \u2019s legs by the feet.Hyperextension (genu recurvatum) is present if the knee ex-\ntends beyond the neutral position. Up to 10 degrees is\nnormal.\n\u0081Test the extreme range of knee \ufb02exion with the patient face\ndown on the couch, which makes comparison with the\ncontralateral side easy. A block to full \ufb02exion is often caused\nby a tear of the posterior horn of the menisci.\nLigament testing\nCollateral ligament\nWith the knee fully extended, abduction or adduction should not\nbe possible. If either ligament is lax or ruptured, movement can\noccur. If the ligament is strained (partially torn) but intact, pain will\nbe produced but the joint will not open.\nExamination sequence (Video 30C)\n\u0081With the patient \u2019s knee fully extended, hold their ankle be-\ntween your elbow and side. Use both hands to apply a valgus\nand then a varus force to the knee.\n\u0081Use your thumbs to feel the joint line and assess the degree\nto which the joint space opens. Major opening of the joint\nindicates collateral and cruciate injury ( Fig. 13.42A ).\n\u0081If the knee is stable, repeat the process with the knee \ufb02exed\nto 30 degrees to assess minor collateral laxity. In this position,\nthe cruciate ligaments are not taut.\nAnterior cruciate ligament\nExamination sequence\nAnterior drawer test\n\u0081Flex the patient \u2019s knee to 90 degrees and maintain this po-\nsition using your thigh to immobilise the patient \u2019s foot.\n\u0081Check that the hamstring muscles are relaxed and look for\nposterior sag (posterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur).\nAB\nFig. 13.42 Testing the ligaments of the knee.

In middle-aged pa-\ntients, degenerative, horizontal cleavage of the menisci is\ncommon, with minimal or no history of trauma. Meniscal in-\njuries commonly cause slow-onset effusions, especially on\nweight bearing or after exercise. Associated joint-line tender-\nness is common.\nA simple test for a meniscal tear is to extend the patient \u2019s knee\nrapidly from 30 degrees of \ufb02exion to full extension. If the patient\nexperiences medial or lateral pain, this suggests a tear, and\nformal testing should take place.\nMeniscal provocation test (McMurray test)\nExamination sequence (Video 30D)\nAsk the patient to lie supine on the couch.

The talus articulates with a three-sidedmortise made up of the tibial plafond and the medial and lateralmalleoli. This allows principally dorsi \ufb02exion and plantar \ufb02exion,\nalthough some axial rotation can occur at the plantar- \ufb02exed\nankle.

Foot movements are inversion and eversion, prin-\ncipally occurring at the mid-tarsal (talonavicular/calcaneocuboid)\nand subtalar (talocalcaneal) joints.\nThe history\nA\u2018twisted \u2019ankle is a very common injury, and is usually related\nto a sporting injury, such as stepping off a kerb or a stair\nawkwardly. Establish the exact mechanism of injury and the\nprecise site of pain. Frequently, there has been a forced inver-\nsion injury, stressing the lateral ligament. A sprain occurs when\nsome \ufb01bres are torn but the ligament remains structurally intact.\nA complete ligament tear allows excessive talar movement in\nthe ankle mortise with instability.\nAchilles tendon rupture is associated with sudden plantar \ufb02exion\nat the ankle against resistance (e.g. in jumping or lunging). It is\ncommon in middle-aged patients doing unaccustomed activities\nsuch as squash, and it is associated with some medications such\nas oral glucocorticoids and \ufb02uoroquinolone antibiotics. Sudden\npain occurs above the heel and there is often a sensation or noise of\na crack. Patients may feel as if they have been kicked or even shot.\nForefoot pain, often localised to the second metatarsal, after\nexcessive activity such as trekking, marching or dancing, sug-\ngests a stress fracture ( Fig. 13.45 ). Symptoms are relieved by\nrest and aggravated by weight bearing.\nNon-traumatic conditions\nAnterior metatarsalgia with forefoot pain is common, especiallyin middle-aged women. Acute joint pain with swelling suggests\nan in \ufb02ammatory arthropathy such as rheumatoid arthritis or\ngout. In severe cases, the metatarsal heads become prominent\nand walking feels like walking on pebbles or broken glass.\nPlantar surface heel pain that is worse in the foot-strike phase\nof walking may be caused by plantar fasciitis and tends to affect\nmiddle-aged patients and those with seronegative arthritides.\nPosterior heel pain may be caused by Achilles tendonitis or\nenthesitis.\nSpontaneous lancinating pain in the forefoot radiating to\ncontiguous sides of adjacent toes occurs with Morton \u2019sneuroma.

Not only are\nthere a vast number of distinct skin diseases, but also each\nmay present with a great variety of morphologies and patterns\ndetermined by intrinsic genetic factors, including the degree of\nskin pigmentation, with the di agnostic waters muddied still\nfurther by external in \ufb02uences such as rubbing and scratching,\ninfection, and well-meaning attempts at topical and systemic\ntreatment.

The adage that the\nskin is a window into the inner workings of the body is entirely\ntrue, and an examination of the integument will often providethe discerning clinician with important clues about internal\ndisease processes, as well as information about the physical\nand psychological wellbeing of an individual.\nAnatomy and physiology\nSkin\nThe skin is the largest of the human organs, with a complexanatomy ( Fig. 14.1 ) and a number of essential functions\n(Box 14.1 ). It has three layers, the most super \ufb01cial of which is the\nepidermis, a strati \ufb01ed squamous epithelium containing melano-\ncytes (pigment-producing cells) within its basal layer and Lang-\nerhans cells (antigen-presenting immune cells) throughout. The\npackaging and distribution of melanin within the epidermal cells\ndetermines the depth of skin pigmentation.\nThe dermis is the middle and most anatomically complex layer,\ncontaining vascular channels, sensory nerve endings, numerous\ncell types (including \ufb01broblasts, macrophages, adipocytes and\nsmooth muscle), hair follicles and glandular structures (eccrine,\nsebaceous and apocrine), all enmeshed in collagen and elastic\ntissue, within a matrix comprising glycosaminoglycan, proteo-\nglycan and glycoprotein.\nEpidermis\nDermis\nSubcutisShaft of hair\nOpening of sweat duct\nSweat duct\nSubpapillary vascular plexus\nSebaceous gland\nArrector pili muscle\nSweat gland\nHair follicle\nSubcutaneous adipose tissue\nDeep cutaneous vascular plexus\nMuscle layer\nFig. 14.1 Structures of the skin.326 \u0081THE SKIN, HAIR AND NAILS"

There are two main types of hair in adults:\n\u0081Vellus hair, which is short and \ufb01ne and covers most of the\nbody surface.\n\u0081Terminal hair, which is longer and thicker and is found on the\ntrunk and limbs, as well as the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes,\nand pubic, axillary and beard areas.\nAbnormalities in hair distribution can occur when there is\ntransitioning between vellus and terminal hair types (e.g., hir-\nsutism in women) or vice versa (androgenic alopecia). Hairs\nundergo regular asynchronous cycles of growth and, thus, inhealth, mass shedding of hair is unusual. Hair loss can occur as a\nresult of disorders of hair cycling, conditions resulting in damage\nto hair follicles (such as scarring in \ufb02ammatory processes), or\nstructural (fragile) hair disorders.\nNails\nThe nail is a plate of densely packed, hardened, keratinised cellsproduced by the nail matrix. It serves to protect the \ufb01ngertip and\naids grasp and \ufb01ngertip sensitivity. The white lunula at the base\nof the nail is the visible distal aspect of the nail matrix ( Fig. 14.2 ).\nFingernail regrowth takes approximately 6 months, and toenail\nregrowth 12 \u201318 months.\nThe history\nThe possible diagnoses in dermatological conditions are broad\nand some diseases have pathognomonic features. Thus, in order\nto ensure that your history-taking is focused and relevant, it may\nbe appropriate to ask to glimpse the lesion or rash before\nembarking on detailed enquiry.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nThese include:\n\u0081A rash: scaly, blistering or itchy\n\u0081A lump or lesion\n\u0081Pruritus (itch)\n\u0081Hair loss or excess hair (hirsutism, hypertrichosis)\n\u0081Nail changes\nAsk:\n\u0081When did the lesion appear, or the rash begin?\n\u0081Where is the rash/lesion?14.1 Functions of the skin\n\u0081Protection against physical injury and injurious substances, including\nultraviolet radiation\n\u0081Anatomical barrier against pathogens\n\u0081Immunological defence\n\u0081Retention of moisture\n\u0081Thermoregulation\n\u0081Calorie reserve\n\u0081Appreciation of sensation (touch, temperature, pain)\n\u0081Vitamin D production\n\u0081Absorption \u2013particularly foetal and neonatal skin\n\u0081Psychosexual and social interaction\nHyponychium\nNail bedNail plate\nDistal phalanxMatrixProximal nail fold (paronychium)\nCuticle\nBDistal edge of nail plate\nNail plateLateral nail fold\n(paronychium)\nLunula\nCuticle\nEponychium\nA\nFig. 14.2 Structure of the nail.

Is the itch\nintense enough to cause bleeding by scratching or to disturb\nsleep, as in atopic eczema and lichen simplex? Are there\nblisters?\n\u0081Do the symptoms vary with time? For example, the pruritus of\nscabies is usually worse at night, and acne and atopic\neczema may show a premenstrual exacerbation.\n\u0081Were there any preceding symptoms, such as a sore throat in\npsoriasis, a severe illness in telogen ef \ufb02uvium, or a new oral\nmedication in drug eruptions?\n\u0081Are there any aggravating or relieving factors?

Self-medication with oral antihistamines may\nameliorate urticaria, and topical glucocorticoids may help\nin\ufb02ammatory reactions.\n\u0081Are there any associated constitutional symptoms, such as\njoint pain (psoriasis), muscle pain and weakness (dermato-\nmyositis), fever, fatigue or weight loss?\n\u0081Very importantly, what is the impact of the rash on the in-\ndividual \u2019s quality of life?\nPast medical and drug history\nAsk about general health and previous medical or skin conditions; a\nhistory of asthma, hay fever or childhood eczema suggests atopy.\nCoeliac disease is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.\nTake a full drug history, including any recent oral or topical\nprescribed or over-the-counter medications. Enquire about al-\nlergies not just to medicines but also to animals or foods.\nFamily and social history\nEnquire about occupation and hobbies, as exposure to chem-icals may cause contact dermatitis. If a rash consistently im-\nproves when a patient is away from work, the possibility of\nindustrial dermatitis should be considered. Ask about alcohol\nconsumption and con \ufb01rm smoking status.\nDocument foreign travel and sun exposure if actinic damage,\ntropical infections or photosensitive eruptions are being consid-\nered. The risk of squamous cell and basal cell cancers increases\nwith total lifetime sun exposure, and intense sun exposures\nleading to blistering burns are a risk factor for melanoma. The\nsusceptibility of an individual to sun-induced damage can be\ndetermined by de \ufb01ning their skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale\n(Box 14.2 ).\nAsk about a family history of atopy and skin conditions.\nThe history of a skin disorder alone rarely enables a de \ufb01nite\ndiagnosis, with perhaps the occasional exception: an itchy\neruption that resembles a nettle rash, the individual components\nof which last less than 24 hours, is very likely to be urticaria; and\nan intensely itchy eruption that affects all body areas except the\nhead (in adults) and is worse in bed at night should be consid-\nered to be scabies until proved otherwise.The physical examination\nProper assessment of the skin involves all the human senses,with the exception of taste. Once we have listened to the pa-\ntient \u2019s history, we look at the rash or lesion, touch the skin, and\noccasionally use our sense of smell to diagnose infection and\nmetabolic disorders such as trimethylaminuria ( \ufb01sh odour syn-\ndrome). The increasing use of remote consultations ( \u2018tele-\ndermatology \u2019) in clinical practice introduces the risk of certain\naspects of patient assessment being compromised, limiting the\nability to make a precise diagnosis.\nExamination of the skin should be performed under conditions\nof privacy in an adequately lit, warm room with, when appro-\npriate, a chaperone present (p. 22). The patient should ideally be\nundressed to a degree that enables visualisation of all affectedareas of the skin, but allowances should be made for modesty\nand religious practices. Routinely, the hair, nails and oral cavity\n(p. 213) should be examined, and the regional lymph nodes (p.\n36) palpated. Assess skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale (see\nBox 14.2 ).\nIn documenting the appearance of a lesion or rash, use the\ncorrect descriptive terminology ( Box 14.3 ); doing so often helps\ncrystallise the diagnostic thought processes.\nDistribution of a rash\nThe distribution of dermatosis can be very informative. Is theeruption symmetrical? If so, it is likely to have a constitutional\nbasis, and if not, it may well have an extrinsic cause. This golden\nrule has occasional exceptions (such as lichen simplex) but holds\ntrue in the majority of instances.\nThe pattern of a rash may immediately suggest a diagnosis:\nfor example, the antecubital and popliteal fossae in atopic\neczema ( Fig. 14.3A ); the extensor limb surfaces (see\nFig. 14.3B ), scalp, nails (see Fig. 3.7A )a n du m b i l i c u si np s o -\nriasis; the \ufb02exural aspects of the wrists and the oral mucous\nmembranes in lichen planus ( Fig. 14.4 ); the scalp, alar grooves\nand nasolabial folds in seborrhoeic dermatitis; and the sparing\nof covered areas in photosensitive eruptions. Does the rash\nfollow a dermatome (as with shingles, see Fig. 7.9 ), or Lang-\ner\u2019s lines of skin tension (as with pityriasis rosea), or Blaschko\n(developmental) lines (as with certain genetic disorders)? The\nlocalisation of an eruption to fresh scars or tattoos may be a\nmanifestation of sarcoidosis, and the anatomical location may\nprovide a clue to diagnosis, such as the tendency of erythema14.2 Fitzpatrick scale of skin types\n\u0081Type 1: always burns, never tans\n\u0081Type 2: usually burns, tans minimally\n\u0081Type 3: sometimes burns, usually tans\n\u0081Type 4: always tans, occasionally burns\n\u0081Type 5: tans easily, rarely burns\n\u0081Type 6: never burns, permanent deep pigmentation328 \u0081THE SKIN, HAIR AND NAILS"

If blood\nis still visible through the glass, it is because red blood cells have\nextravasated (purpura). When granulomatous disorders (such as\nsarcoidosis or granuloma annulare) are diascoped, they typically\nmanifest a green \u2013brown ( \u2018apple jelly \u2019) colour.\nWood \u2019s lamp\nExamination of the skin using an ultraviolet light (Wood \u2019s lamp) is\nuseful in two clinical situations: it enhances the contrast between\nnormal skin and under - or over-pigmented epidermis (making\nconditions such as vitiligo and melasma easier to see); and it can\nidentify certain infections by inducing the causative organisms to\ufb02uoresce (such as erythrasma, pityriasis versicolor and some\nringworm infections).\nInvestigations\nAfter clinical examination, speci \ufb01c investigative techniques may\nbe necessary in some cases to enable a precise diagnosis.\nSkin biopsy\nThis involves a sample of skin being removed under local\nanaesthesia and subjected to histological or immunohisto-\nchemical examination in the laboratory. However, clinico-\npathological correlation is usually necessary.\nMycology\nA fungal infection can be con \ufb01rmed (or refuted) by scraping scale\nfrom the surface of a rash with a scalpel blade, clipping samples\nof nail or plucking hair, and undertaking microscopic examination\nand culture.\nPatch testing\nPatch testing ( Fig. 14.20 ) is performed to establish whether a\ncontact allergy is the cause of an individual \u2019s rash. It involves\napplying putative allergens to the patient \u2019s skin, leaving the test\npatches undisturbed for 2 days, removing them and then reading\nthe \ufb01nal result after 4 days.

            "Text": "Jaundice\nMany newborns develop jaundice in the days after birth. Look for\nyellow sclerae in newborns with coloured skin, or you may miss\nit. Examine the baby in bright normal light. Normal physiologicaljaundice cannot be distinguished clinically from jaundice from\na pathological cause. Newborn infants with jaundice require a\nbilirubin measurement to assess the need for further investigation\nand possible treatment.\nJitteriness\nJitteriness is high-frequency tremor of the limbs and is common\nin term infants in the \ufb01rst few days. It is stilled by stimulating\nthe infant and is not associated with other disturbance. If\njitteriness is excessive, exclude hypoglycaemia, polycythaemia\nand neonatal abstinence syndrome (drug withdrawal). Infre-\nquent jerks in light sleep are common and normal; regular clonic\njerks are abnormal.\nDysmorphism\nIdentifying abnormal body structure (dysmorphism) is subjective\nbecause of human variability. Individual features may be minor\nand isolated or may signify a major problem requiring investiga-\ntion and management. A recognisable pattern of several\ndysmorphic features together may indicate a \u2018dysmorphic syn-\ndrome \u2019such as Down0s syndrome (p. 36). Use caution and\nsensitivity when discussing possible dysmorphism with parents\nof a newborn child.\nHypotonia\nHypotonia (reduced tone) may be obvious when you handle an\ninfant. Term infants \u2019muscle tone normally produces a \ufb02exed\nposture at the hips, knees and elbows. Hypotonic infants may\nlack this \ufb02exion. Hypotonia can occur with hypoxia, hypo-\nglycaemia or sepsis, or may be due to a speci \ufb01c brain, nerve or\nmuscle problem. Preterm infants have lower tone than term in-\nfants and are less \ufb02exed.\nApgar score\nThis \ufb01rst clinical assessment of a neonate is made immedi-\nately after birth. Tone, colour, breathing, heart rate and\nresponse to stimulation are each scored 0, 1 or 2 (see\nBox 15.2 ), giving a maximum total of 10. Healthy neonates\ncommonly score 8 to 10 at 1 and 5 minutes. The score\npredicts the need for, and ef \ufb01cacy of, resuscitation. A low\nscore should increase with time; a decreasing score is a\ncause for concern. Persistently low scores at 10 minutes\npredict death or later disability. Neonates with scores of less\nthan 8 at 5 minutes require continued evaluation until it is\nclear they are healthy.The physical examination of newborns\nTiming and ef \ufb01cacy of the routine neonatal\nexamination\nExamine a newborn with the parents present. There is no ideal\ntime. If it is performed on day 1, some forms of congenital heart\ndisease may be missed because signs have not developed. If it is\ndelayed, some babies will present before the examination with\nillness that may have been detectable earlier. Approximately 9% of\nneonates have an identi \ufb01able congenital abnormality, but most are\nnot serious. Always record your examination comprehensively to\navoid problems if illness or physical abnormality is identi \ufb01ed later.\nFewer than half of all cases of congenital heart disease or\ncongenital cataract are detected by newborn examination.\nGeneral examination\nExamine babies and infants in a warm place on a \ufb01rm bed or\nexamination table. Have a system to avoid omitting anything, but\navoid an overly rigid approach as you may be unable to perform\nkey elements if you unsettle the baby. Do things that may disturb\nthe baby later in the examination sequence.\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Observe whether the baby looks well and is well grown.\n\u0081Look for:\n\u0081cyanosis\n\u0081respiratory distress\n\u0081pallor\n\u0081plethora (suggesting polycythaemia).\n\u0081Note posture and behaviour.\n\u0081Note any dysmorphic features.\n\u0081Auscultate the heart and palpate the abdomen if the baby is\nquiet.\n\u0081If the baby cries, does the cry sound normal?\nSkin\nNormal \ufb01ndings\nThe skin may look normal, dry, wrinkled or vernix covered in healthy\nbabies. There may be meconium staining of the skin and nails.\nProminent capillaries commonly cause pink areas called\n\u2018stork \u2019s beak marks \u2019at the nape of the neck, eyelids and glabella\n(Fig. 15.1 ). Facial marks fade spontaneously over months; those\non the neck often persist. Milia ( \ufb01ne white spots) and acne\nneonatorum (larger cream-coloured spots) are collected glan-dular secretions and disappear within 2 to 4 weeks. Erythema\ntoxicum is a common \ufb02eeting, blanching, idiopathic mac-\nulopapular rash of no consequence, affecting the trunk, face and\nlimbs in the \ufb01rst few days after birth.The physical examination of newborns \u0081343\n15"

Lower limb SpO2should be 95% or\nhigher.\nHeart rates between 80 and 160 beats per minute (bpm) can\nbe normal in the newborn, depending on the arousal state\n(Box 15.4 ).\nAbnormal \ufb01ndings\nInfants with heart failure typically look pale and sweaty and have\nrespiratory distress (p. 342).\nIf the apex beat is displaced laterally, there may be car-\ndiomegaly, or mediastinal shift due to contralateral pneumo-\nthorax or pleural effusion.\nWeak or absent femoral pulses suggest coarctation of the\naorta. Radiofemoral delay is not identi \ufb01able in the newborn.Patent ductus arteriosus may cause a short systolic murmur in\nthe early days of life because the pulmonary and systemic blood\npressures are similar, which limits shunting through the duct.

Re-examine at 6 weeks if there is\nany doubt about the position of the testes.\n\u0081Transilluminate any large scrotal swellings using a torch to\nsee if the light is transmitted through the swelling. Thissuggests a hydrocoele but can be misleading because a\nhernia of thin-walled bowel may transilluminate ( Fig. 15.9 ).\n\u0081An inguinal hernia usually produces a groin swelling, but, if\nlarge, this may extend into the scrotum. Try to reduce it bygently pushing the contents upwards from the scrotum\nthrough the inguinal canal into the abdomen.\nNormal \ufb01ndings\nThe testes are smooth and soft and measure 0.7 \u00c21 cm across.\nThe right testis usually descends later than the left and sits higher\nin the scrotum.\nAbnormal \ufb01ndings\nA hydrocoele is a collection of \ufb02uid beneath the tunica vaginalis of\nthe testis and/or the spermatic cord (p. 266). Most resolve\nspontaneously in infancy.In hypospadias the meatal opening is on the ventral aspect of\nthe glans, the ventral shaft of the penis or the scrotum or more\nposteriorly on the perineum ( Figs 15.10 and 15.11A ). In epis-\npadias, which is rare, it is on the dorsum of the penis. Chordee is\ncurvature of the penis and is commonly associated with hypo-\nspadias and tethering of the foreskin (see Fig. 15.11B ).\nSpine and sacrum\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Turn the baby over.\n\u0081Inspect and palpate the entire vertebral column from neck to\nsacrum for neural tube defects.\nNormal \ufb01ndings\nSacral dimples are common and unimportant, provided the\ndimple base has normal skin and they are single, less than 5 mm\nin diameter and less than 2.5 cm from the anus.\nAbnormal \ufb01ndings\nPigmented patches may indicate spina bi \ufb01da occulta. Dimples\nabove the natal cleft, away from the midline, or hairy or pig-\nmented patches with a base that cannot be visualised require\nfurther investigation.\nNeurological examination\nThis includes tone, posture, movement and primitive re \ufb02exes.\nGeneral neurological assessment\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Look for asymmetry in posture and movement and for muscle\nwasting.\n\u0081To assess tone, pick the baby up and note if they are stiff or\n\ufb02oppy. Note any difference between each side.\n\u0081Power is dif \ufb01cult to assess and depends on the state of\narousal. Look for strong symmetrical limb and trunk move-ments and grasp.\n\u0081Tendon re \ufb02exes are of value only in assessing infants with\nneurological or muscular abnormalities.\n\u0081Check sensation by seeing whether the baby withdraws from\ngentle stimuli. Do not in \ufb02ict painful stimuli or use a pin or\nneedle.\n\u0081Check eyesight by carrying the alert baby to a dark corner.\nThis normally causes the eyes to open wide. In a bright area\nthe baby will screw up their eyes.\nIdeally, electronic audiological screening should also be per-\nformed in the newborn period.\nNormal \ufb01ndings\nMovements should be equal on both sides.\nTone varies and may be \ufb02oppy after a feed.

            "Text": "OLDER CHILDREN\nIndividuals between 12 months and 16 years are known by\nnonspeci \ufb01c terms, including toddler, preschool, child, adoles-\ncent, teenager or young person. It is important to recognise and\nacknowledge age-related maturation, and a common phrase to\nspan these years is \u2018children and young people \u2019(CYP).\nThe history\nObtaining a history from children and young\npeople compared with adults\nThere are many similarities in taking a history from CYP and from\nadults. Introduce yourself to the CYP and accompanying adult,\nand begin your observation of the CYP. Establish who the adult\nis (e.g. a parent, grandparent or carer), and begin to consider to\nwhat extent the CYP will be able to contribute to the history. Let\nthe CYP become accustomed to you before asking speci \ufb01c\nquestions.\nStart with open-ended questions. Most often a parent will wish\nto explain their perspective on the CYP \u2019s problem, and it is\nimportant to enable them to do so. Young people in particular\nmay wish to explain the problem from their perspective, and it is\nimportant to directly and openly engage with the CYP to give this\nopportunity. Once the presenting symptoms have been outlined,\nthe history should focus on questions that aim to elucidate the\ndifferential diagnosis; a CYP is often good at helping with these\nmore speci \ufb01c questions. Respect age and ability to recall events,\nand adopt a balanced perspective on whether responses from\nthe parents or the CYP are more likely to be accurate for each\nquestion. Children younger than 6 years often provide little his-\ntory, those aged 6 to 11 years can do so if they are suf \ufb01ciently\ncon\ufb01dent, and those aged 12 years and older should be able to\nprovide a valuable history in the correct environment and with the\nuse of questions that are framed in appropriate terminology. Asyou would for adult history taking, include re \ufb02ective summing up:\nfor example, \u2018So what you are saying is that .\u2019.\nA paediatric history includes elements that are not part of the\nadult history (obstetric, developmental, immunisation histories),\nsystematic enquiry has different components from those in\nadults (see later) and the differential diagnosis may include\nconditions seen only in children (e.g. abdominal migraine, toddler\ndiarrhoea, croup, viral wheeze and febrile convulsion). Most otherdiagnoses also occur in adults.\nCommon presenting symptoms\nDiagnosis is built on patterns of symptoms; rarely will any one\nsymptom or sign lead to a \u2018spot diagnosis \u2019. The initial history\nsuggests a differential diagnosis and prompts additional ques-\ntions to assess the probability of particular diagnoses. As with\nadults, presenting symptoms should be described in terms ofonset, frequency, severity, duration, aggravating and relieving\nfactors, associated features and impact on function. Pain and the\nneed for analgesia can be particularly dif \ufb01cult to assess in young\nchildren; objective scoring systems may help ( Box 15.6 ).\nThe most common presenting problems in the child affect the\nrespiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems (covered in\nBoxes 15.7 \u201315.9) and the skin.\nSkin symptoms can be acute or chronic. Acute-onset rash is\ncommon in children and can be described using the same ter-\nminology as for adults (see Chapter 14 ). Those who examine skin\nrashes in CYP should be able to describe the rash across all skin\ncolours as appearances can be very different ( Fig 15.17 ). An\nexcellent resource (developed by a medical student) is the\nwebsite www.blackandbrownskin.org.uk .\nMost rashes are viral and resolve spontaneously. Rash with\nblistering is often itchy. It may be urticarial (with an environmental,\nviral, food or medicine trigger) or an insect bite. Blisters with\nassociated yellow crusting may be infected bullous impetigo\n(most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus ).15.5 Developmental attainment of preschool children at different ages*\nSkills 4 months 6 months 10 months 1 \u20132 years 2 \u20133 years 3 \u20135 years\nGross\nmotorHas good head control on\npull to sitKeeps back straightwhen held in sittingpositionSupports weight on hands\nwhen laid proneRolls front to backSits unsupported\nPulls to standWalks without\nsupportRuns\nBounces ontrampolinePedals a tricycle\nFine\nmotorOpens hands\nHolds objects placed in\nhandTransfers objects from\nhand to hand and to\nmouthUses pincer grip\nbilaterally without hand\npreferenceHolds a crayon\nand scribblesCan draw a\ncircleCan draw a cross,\nsquare, face/\nperson\nPersonal\nsocialShows interest in toys\nLaughs, vocalisesHas a variety of speech\nnoises\nPlays peep-boStarts to understand\nsome words\nClaps handsHas 10 \u201320\nrecognisable\nwordsCan\ncommunicate\nverballyHas 500 \u20131500\nwords\nIs dry by day\nDevelopment is extremely variable and failure to attain only one milestone is of little signi \ufb01cance, whereas failure to attain several milestones is cause\nfor concern.The history \u0081353\n15"

It is important to establish who the family is and\nrecognise that this may be in different households with different\nadults at different times. Children at risk of neglect may have\ncomplex domestic arrangements such as several caregivers; it is\nimportant that you understand these arrangements. Ask open\nand non-judgemental questions to understand:\n\u0081Who lives in the family home, and who cares for the child? Is\nthere another household where the child spends regular\ntime?\n\u0081Does anyone smoke in these places?\n\u0081Are there any pets? Are any symptoms associated with pet\ncontact?\nA BC\nFig. 15.17 Appearance of measles rash in different skin colours. From Ottolini MG. Measles. In: Goldman-Cecil Medicine. 26th edn.

Consider parental consanguinity,\nwhich is not uncommon in some ethnic groups.\nOccasionally, chronic symptoms are associated with anxiety\nor potential \u2018secondary \u2019gain for the CYP; these may include\nchronic cough, abdominal pain and headache in a well-looking\nCYP in whom examination is normal. Look carefully at the\nCYP \u2019s facial expression, eye contact and body language when\nasking questions. Ask carefully but speci \ufb01cally about school\n(avoidance and bullying), social interactions (does the child have\nmany friends?) and out-of-school activities. School avoidance\nshould be addressed if it is related to anxiety or if the pretext of\nmedical symptoms is used.\nSystematic enquiry\nThis screens for illnesses or symptoms that may be not recog-nised as important or relevant by the CYP or parents. For CYP\naged over 12 years, the questions used for adults are appro-\npriate. In younger children, ask age-related questions. Speci \ufb01c\nareas include:\n\u0081Ear, nose and throat: ask the parents about their perception\nof a child \u2019s hearing ability (reduced in chronic otitis media),\nrepeated sneezing (rhinitis) or the presence of regular snoring\nwith periods of struggling to breathe (symptomatic obstruc-\ntive sleep apnoea).\n\u0081Gastrointestinal system: ask whether growth is as expected\nand whether there is recurrent abdominal pain or dif \ufb01culty in\nopening the bowels (constipation).\n\u0081Respiratory system: ask whether the child has had a\nregular cough (particularly asleep) when otherwise well\nor had wheeze on a recurrent basis in response to\ntriggers such as viral infection or exercise (consider\nasthma).\n\u0081Urinary system: 15% of children at 5 years of age will\ncontinue to have primary nocturnal enuresis. It is embar-\nrassing for most children and frustrating to most parents, so\nbe sensitive in your questioning on frequency and timing of\nevents.\nThe physical examination\nNormal growth and development\nAn understanding of CYP development is vital to identifying\nwhether symptoms and signs are consistent with age.\nFor the \ufb01rst 2 years of life, children born prematurely should\nhave their age adjusted to their expected date of delivery instead\nof their date of birth when assessing growth and development.\nFailure to make this correction would otherwise create a false\nimpression of poor growth and developmental delay.Prematurely born infants can be at increased risk of impaired\ngrowth and development and merit increased surveillance,\nalthough most develop normally.\nGrowth\nGrowth after infancy is extremely variable. Use gender- and\nethnicity-speci \ufb01c growth charts (e.g. those shown in\nFig. 15.18 ). CYP with Trisomy 21 have a differential growth\ntrajectory, and speci \ufb01c charts to support growth monitoring are\navailable online ( https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/\ndownsyndrome/growth-charts.html ). Growth charts enable a\ncomparison of the individual with the corresponding population\nnormal range at a single time point. As important is the ability ofgrowth charts to enable tracking of growth trajectories over\ntime when a CYP is regularly measured. Each child should grow\nalong a centile line for height and weight throughout childhood.\nFailure to thrive is failure to attain the expected growth trajec-\ntory. A child on the 0.4th centile for height may be thriving if this\nhas always been their growth trajectory, while a child on the\n50th centile for height may be failing to thrive if previously they\nwere on the 99.6th centile.\nA child \u2019s height is related to the average of their parents \u2019height\ncentile \u00c62 standard deviations. Parents whose average height\nlies on the 50th centile will have children whose height will nor-\nmally lie between the 2nd and 98th centiles (approximately\n10 cm above and below the 50th centile).\nNeurodevelopmental maturation\nNormal development is heterogeneous within the population,\nwhich can make abnormalities dif \ufb01cult to identify. Important de-\nterminants are the child \u2019s environment and genetic potential.\nDevelopmental assessment requires patience, familiarity with\nchildren and an understanding of the range of normality for a\ngiven age.\nThe preschool child (1 to 5 years)\nAt the younger end of this range, questions and observations\nrelating to gross motor skills are most sensitive; as the child\nbecomes older, questions and observations relating to \ufb01ne motor\nand personal social skills become more meaningful. Delayed\nspeech with normal attainment of motor milestones is not un-\ncommon, particularly in boys, but should prompt hearingassessment (see Box 15.5 ).\nThe school-age child (5 \u00feyears)\nBy this age, many neurodevelopmental problems have revealed\nthemselves to parents, and relevant agencies, such as educa-\ntional ones, may already be engaged. However, more subtle\ndevelopmental problems such as dyslexia (learning disability\naffecting \ufb02uency and comprehension in reading) may remain\nunrecognised and can be a major handicap. Ask general ques-\ntions such as, \u2018How is your child getting on at school? \u2019and\nfollow up by enquiring speci \ufb01cally about academic and social\nactivity.The physical examination \u0081357\n15"

Examining CYP requires a\nrange of skills that take time to learn. The key skills involve being:\n\u0081Observant during discussion or play, to identify elements of\nthe examination that are naturally displayed and so can be\npartitioned from the formal examination process, reducing the\nduration of what is often a stressful encounter, particularly for\nyounger children.\n\u0081Opportunistic, to examine systems as CYP present them.\nChest and cardiac auscultation may be better earlier in the\nexamination in younger children before they become restless\nor upset.\n\u0081Adaptive to CYP \u2019s mood and playfulness.

Faecal loading of the left iliac fossa is common in con-\nstipation. Rectal examination is rarely indicated in CYP, but ex-\namination of the anus for \ufb01ssures (common with constipation)\ncan be helpful where appropriate.\nNeurological examination\nTest power initially by watching the CYP demonstrate theirstrength against gravity.

If appropriate, test power\nagainst your strength.\nNeck stiffness in CYP is usually apparent when you are talking\nto them or their parents. CYP with meningitis will not want to\nmove, and if they are forced to do so, the neck remains alignedwith the trunk. With a young child, move a toy to catch their\nattention and see if they move their head.\nSpotting the sick children and young people\nIt can be dif \ufb01cult to identify CYP with severe illness, particularly\nyounger children. With experience you will learn to identify\nwhether CYP are just miserable or really ill. Early-warning scores\n(e.g. Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS), Fig. 15.24 ) can\nhelp. Certain features correlate with severe illness ( Box 15.13 ).\nChild protection\nCYP who experience neglect or physical and/or emotional abuse\nare at increased risk of health problems. At-risk CYP may already\nbe known to other agencies but do not assume this is the case\nwhen interagency communications are not available to you.Injuries from physical abuse can often be detected visually.\nConsider nonaccidental injury if the history is not consistent with\nthe injury or if the injury is present in unusual places such as over\nthe back. It may be dif \ufb01cult to detect neglect during a brief\nencounter, but consider it if the child appears unkempt, has\nunexplained pain/discomfort or is socially withdrawn. The\nparent \u2013child relationship gives insight into neglect; the child is\napparently scared of the parent ( \u2018frozen watchfulness \u2019) or the\nparent appears oblivious to the child \u2019s attention ( Box 15.14 ).\nRemote consultation in paediatric\npractice\nThe recent global pandemic has made necessary remote\nconsultation. While this may become part of normal practice in\nfuture, it has signi \ufb01cant limitations as well as advantages (see\nChapter 21 ). There is a risk that remote consultation can adversely\naffect the appropriate assessment of CYP in communities or\nhouseholds where technology and access to WiFi do not enable a\nvisual review of the child. Where video consultation is possible,\nalways ensure that CYP are present at least at the start of the\nconsultation so that you can ask speci \ufb01c questions of them and\nobserve any speci \ufb01c signs that may help your clinical decision\nmaking.

            "Text": "Mental disorders are very common, frequently coexist with\nphysical disorders and cause much mortality and morbidity.\nPsychiatric assessment is, therefore, a required skill for all clini-\ncians. It consists of four elements: history, mental state exami-\nnation (MSE), selective physical examination and collateral\ninformation. Each element can be expanded considerably, so the\nassessment must be adapted to its purpose. Is it a quick\nscreening of a patient presenting with other problems, a con \ufb01r-\nmation of a suspected diagnosis or a comprehensive review for a\nsecond opinion?\nThe history\nGeneral approach\nThe distinction between symptoms and signs is less clear in\npsychiatry than in the rest of medicine. The psychiatric interview,\nwhich covers both, has several purposes: to obtain a history of\nsymptoms, to assess the present mental state for signs and to\nestablish rapport that will facilitate further management.\nA comprehensive history covers a range of areas ( Box 16.1 ),\nbut the nature of the presenting problem and/or the referral\nquestion, and the setting in which the history is being taken, will\ndetermine the degree of detail needed for each. When seeing\nsomeone in the Emergency Department with a \ufb01rst episode of\npsychosis, the focus is on symptoms, recent changes in func-\ntion, family history and drug use; when interviewing someone in\nan outpatient clinic with a possible personality disorder,\nassessment concentrates instead on their personal history,\nwhich is essentially a systematised biography ( Box 16.2 ).Sensitive topics\nSome subjects require a particular skill. The common theme is\nreluctance to disclose, which can arise because the information is\nprivate and disclosure is potentially embarrassing (such as sexual\ndysfunction), distressing (major previous traumatic experiences,\nsuch as rape, childhood sexual abuse, witnessing a death) or\nincriminating (illicit drug misuse, other crimes, homicidal ideas). For\ninterviews undertaken in non-clinical settings, such as police sta-\ntions or prisons, or for the provision of court reports, potentially\nincriminating disclosures are obviously especially pertinent, and it\nis important to be clear with the patient about any limits to\ncon\ufb01dentiality in your interview. Some disclosures, such as those\nrelating to sexual orientation or gender identity, may expose pa-\ntients to the real or perceived risk of hostility or discrimination.\nTry to develop rapport early in the interview, if possible, and to\nconsolidate it before raising a sensitive topic, although some-\ntimes you must cover such material without delay. It is particularly\nimportant to ask about suicidal thoughts.\nWhile clinicians should be able to interview patients regardless\nof their age, gender, ethnic origin or sexual orientation, the skills\nrequired may vary because patient attitudes may differ. For\nexample, it may be more dif \ufb01cult for a male patient to discuss\nerectile dysfunction with a female than a male interviewer, or for\nan adolescent patient to relate to an interviewer in their late\nmiddle age than someone closer to their own years. Clinicians\nneed to be aware of the potential effects of demographic and\nother differences between themselves and their patients.\nThe uncooperative patient\nAdapt your approach to a patient who is mute, agitated, hostileor otherwise uncooperative during the interview by relying more\non observation and collateral information. The safety of the pa-\ntient, other patients, staff and the wider public is paramount, so\nyour initial assessment of an agitated or hostile patient may be\nonly partial.\nThe mental state examination\nThe MSE is a systematic evaluation of the patient \u2019s mental\ncondition at the time of interview. The aim is to establish signs of\nmental disorder that, taken along with the history, enable you to\nmake, suggest or exclude a diagnosis. While making your spe-\nci\ufb01c enquiries, you need to observe, evaluate and draw in-\nferences in the light of the history. This may be daunting, but with\ngood teaching, practice and experience, you will learn the skills.\nThe MSE incorporates elements of the history, observation of\nthe patient, speci \ufb01c questions exploring various mental phe-\nnomena, and short tests of cognitive function. Like the history, its\nfocus is determined by the potential diagnoses. For example,\ndetailed cognitive assessment in an elderly patient presenting\nwith confusion is crucial; similarly, you should carefully evaluate\nmood and suicidal thoughts when the presenting problem is\ndepression.16.1 Content of a psychiatric history\n\u0081Referral source\n\u0081Reason for referral\n\u0081History of presenting symptom(s)\n\u0081Systematic enquiry into other relevant problems and symptoms\n\u0081Past medical/psychiatric history\n\u0081Prescribed and non-prescribed medication\n\u0081Substance use: illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine\n\u0081Family history (including psychiatric disorders)\n\u0081Personal history\n16.2 Personal history\n\u0081Childhood development\n\u0081Losses and experiences\n\u0081Education\n\u0081Occupation(s)\n\u0081Financial circumstances\n\u0081Relationships\u0081Partner(s) and children\n\u0081Housing\n\u0081Leisure activities\n\u0081Hobbies and interests\n\u0081Forensic history368 \u0081PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND LEARNING DISABILITY"

Judging the former requires aware-\nness of the way belief sets can vary between cultures and sub-\ngroups. What is commonplace in some groups within society is\nsometimes regarded by those in other groups as so bizarre that\nit amounts to prima facie evidence of mental illness. It may be\nnecessary to have a patient assessed by a clinician from the\nsame subgroup, if possible, to address any doubts. Failing that,\nthe clinician should interview others from the same subgroup to\ncalibrate the patient \u2019s belief-set against theirs.\nOvervalued ideas\nThese are usually beliefs of great personal signi \ufb01cance. They fall\nshort of being full delusions but are abnormal because of their\neffects on a person \u2019s behaviour or wellbeing. For example, in\nanorexia nervosa, people may still believe they are fat when they\nare seriously underweight \u2013and then respond to their belief,\nrather than their measured weight, by further starving\nthemselves.\nDelusional beliefs\nDelusions are beliefs which are \ufb01rmly held despite clear evidence\nto the contrary and which are out of keeping with the patient \u2019s\ncultural background. These beliefs matter greatly to the person\nholding them, resulting in powerful emotions and important\nbehavioural consequences; they are always of clinical signi \ufb01-\ncance. They are classi \ufb01ed by their content, such as:\n\u0081paranoid\n\u0081religious\n\u0081grandiose\n\u0081hypochondriacal\n\u0081of guilt\n\u0081of love\n\u0081of jealousy\n\u0081of infestation\n\u0081of thought interference (broadcasting, insertion and\nwithdrawal)\n\u0081of control.Bizarre delusions are easy to recognise, but not all delusions\nare in themselves unusual ideas: a spouse convinced that their\npartner is unfaithful may or may not be deluded. Even if a partner\nwere unfaithful, it would still amount to delusional jealousy if the\nbelief were held without evidence or for some unaccountable\nreason, such as \ufb01nding a dead bird in the garden.\nDelusions can sometimes be understood as the patient \u2019s way\nof trying to make sense of their experience, while the content ofthe delusions often gives a clue that may help type the underlying\nillness: for example, delusions of guilt suggest severe depres-\nsion, whereas grandiose delusions typify mania.\nSome delusions are characteristic of schizophrenia. They\ninclude a delusional perception (or primary delusion) and\n\u2018passivity phenomena \u2019: namely, the belief (linked to the experi-\nence) that thoughts, feelings or acts are no longer controlled by a\nperson \u2019s own free will.\nPerceptions\nPeople normally distinguish between their inner and outer worlds\nwith ease: we know what is real, what reality feels like and what\nresides in our \u2018mind \u2019s eye \u2019or\u2018mind \u2019s ear \u2019. In mental illness, this\ndistinction can become disrupted, so that normal perceptions\nbecome unfamiliar, while abnormal perceptions seem real.\nAbnormal perceptions are assessed via the history and spe-\nci\ufb01c enquiries, backed up by observation. They fall into several\ncategories, de \ufb01ned in Box 16.9 .\nPerceptions may be altered (as in sensory distortions or illu-\nsions) or false (as in hallucinations and pseudohallucinations). In a\nthird category, what is altered is not a perception in a speci \ufb01c\nsensory modality but a general sense of disconnection and un-\nreality in oneself (depersonalisation), the world (derealisation) or\nboth.\nPeople \ufb01nd depersonalisation and derealisation intensely un-\npleasant but hard to describe. They may occur in association\nwith severe tiredness or intense anxiety, but can also arise in\nmost types of mental illness.

            "Text": "With altered perceptions, there is a real external object, but its\nsubjective perception has been distorted. Sensory distortions,\nsuch as unpleasant ampli \ufb01cation of light (photophobia) or sound\n(hyperacusis), can occur in physical diseases but are also\ncommon in anxiety states and drug intoxication or withdrawal.\nDiminution of perceptions, including pain, can occur in depres-\nsion and schizophrenia.\nIllusions, in which, for example, a bedside locker is mis-\nperceived as a threatening animal commonly occur among\npeople with established impairment of vision or hearing. They are\nalso found in predisposed patients who are subjected to sensory\ndeprivation, notably after dark in a patient with clouding of\nconsciousness. They are suggestive of an organic illness such as\ndelirium, dementia or alcohol withdrawal.\nTrue hallucinations arise without external stimuli. They\nusually indicate severe mental illness, although they can occur\nnaturally when going to sleep (hypnagogic) or waking up\n(hypnopompic). Hallucinations are categorised according to\ntheir sensory modality as auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory\nor tactile.\nAny form of hallucination can occur in any severe mental dis-\norder. The most common are auditory and visual hallucinations,\nthe former associated with schizophrenia and the latter with\ndelirium. Some auditory hallucinations are characteristic of\nschizophrenia, such as voices discussing the patient in the third\nperson or giving a running commentary on the person \u2019s activities\n(\u2018Now he \u2019s opening the kitchen cupboard \u2019). Ask, for example,\n\u2018Do you ever hear voices when nobody is talking? \u2019and \u2018What do\nthey say? \u2019\nPseudohallucinations are common. The key distinction from a\ntrue hallucination is that they occur within the patient, rather than\narising externally. They have an \u2018as if \u2019quality and lack the vivid-\nness and reality of true hallucinations. Consequently, the affected\nperson is not usually distressed by them, and does not normally\nfeel the need to respond, as often happens with true\nhallucinations.\nCognition\nIf the history and observations suggest a cognitive de \ufb01cit, it must\nbe evaluated by standard tests. History, observation, MSE and\nrating scales (see later) are then used together to diagnose\nand distinguish between the \u20183Ds \u2019(dementia, delirium and\ndepression), which are common in the elderly and in hospital\ninpatients.\nCore cognitive functions include:\n\u0081level of consciousness\n\u0081orientation\n\u0081memory\n\u0081attention and concentration\n\u0081intelligence.\nLevel of consciousness\nMental disorders are rarely associated with a reduced (or clou-\nded) level of consciousness, such as drowsiness, stupor orcoma. The exception is delirium (which is both a physical and a\nmental disorder), where it is common.\nOrientation\nThis is a key aspect of cognitive function, being particularly\nsensitive to impairment. Disorientation is the hallmark of the\n\u2018organic mental state \u2019found in delirium and dementia. Abnor-\nmalities may be evident during the interview, but some patients\nare adept at hiding them in social interactions. Check the pa-\ntient \u2019s orientation to time, place and person by evaluating their\nknowledge of the current time and date, recognition of where\nthey are and identi \ufb01cation of familiar people.\nMemory\nMemory function is divided into three elements:\n\u0081Registration is tested by asking the patient to repeat, after\nyou, the names of three unrelated objects (e.g. apple, table,\npenny); any mistake is signi \ufb01cant. Alternatively, in the digit\nspan test, ask the patient to repeat after you a sequence of\nrandom single-digit numbers. Make sure you speak slowly\nand clearly. A person with normal function can produce at\nleast \ufb01ve digits.\n\u0081Short-term memory (where short-term is de \ufb01ned as a matter\nof minutes) is tested by giving the patient some new infor-\nmation; once this has registered, check retention after 5 mi-\nnutes, with a distracting task in between. Do the same with\nthe names of three objects; any error is signi \ufb01cant. Alterna-\ntively, use a six-item name and address (in the format: \ufb01rst\nname, last name, house number, street name, street type,\ntown: (for example, Premal Rahindran, 25 Green Street,\nLeeds). More than one error indicates impairment.\n\u0081Long-term memory is assessed mainly from personal history.\nGaps and mistakes are often obvious, but some patients may\nconfabulate (that is, \ufb01ll in the gaps with plausible but un-\nconsciously fabricated facts), so check the account with a\nfamily member or other informant if possible. Confabulation is\na core feature of Korsakoff \u2019s syndrome, a complication of\nchronic alcoholism. Failing long-term memory is characteristicof dementia, although the store of knowledge can be\nremarkably intact in the presence of severe impairment of\nother cognitive functions.\nImpaired attention and concentration\nThese occur in many mental disorders and are not diagnostic.Impaired attention is observed as increased distractibility, with\nthe patient responding inappropriately to intrusive internal events\n(memories, obsessions, anxious ruminations) or to extraneous\nstimuli, which may be either real (a noise outside the room) or\nunreal (auditory hallucinations).\nConcentration is the patient \u2019s ability to persist with a mental\ntask. It is tested by using simple, repetitive sequences, such as\nasking the patient to repeat the months of the year or days of the\nweek in reverse, or to do the \u2018serial 7s \u2019test, in which 7 is372 \u0081PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND LEARNING DISABILITY"

If in doubt as to whether\nthe patient has a learning disability, or if there is a discrepancy\nbetween the history and presentation, a psychologist should be\nasked to formally test IQ.\nInsight\nInsight is the degree to which a patient agrees that they are ill. Itcan be broken down into the recognition that abnormal mental\nexperiences are in fact abnormal, agreement that these abnor-\nmalities amount to a mental illness, and acceptance of the need\nfor treatment. Insight matters, since a lack of it often leads to non-\nadherence, and sometimes to the need for compulsory detention.\nYou might ask, \u2018Do you think anything is wrong with you \u2019or\u2018If you\nare ill, what do you think needs to happen to make you better? \u2019\nRisk assessment\nRisk assessment is a crucial part of every psychiatric assess-\nment. Consider:\n\u0081Who is at risk?\n\u0081What is the nature of the risk?\n\u0081What is the likelihood of the risk?\nThe person usually at risk, if anyone, is the patient themselves.\nThe risk posed to others by people with mental disorder must be\nneither overstated nor ignored. Any others at risk are most likely\nto be family or, less commonly, speci \ufb01c individuals (such as\ncelebrities, in cases of stalking) or members of speci \ufb01c groups\n(de\ufb01ned by age, ethnicity, occupation and so on). Sometimes the\nrisk applies non-speci \ufb01cally to strangers or to anyone preventing\nthe patient from achieving their goals.\nThere may be direct risk to life and limb (as in suicide, self-\nharm or violence to others), or it may be an indirect risk, either\nto health (through refusal of treatment for physical or mental\nillness) or welfare (through inability to provide basic care \u2013food,\nwarmth, shelter, hygiene \u2013for oneself or one \u2019s dependents). The\nrisk may be imminent, as in a patient actively attempting self-\nharm, or remote, as in a patient refusing prophylactic medical\ntreatment. Direct risks tend to be imminent and indirect risks\nremote, although this is not always so. A patient declining renal\ndialysis because their depression makes them feel unworthy is at\nan imminent but indirect risk of death. Finally, the likelihood of the\nrisk may range from near certainty to a hypothetical possibility.\nA risk assessment should readily distinguish between cases\nwhere there is an imminent, direct and near-certain risk to the\npatient \u2019s life (such as a man actively trying to throw himself from\nthe window to escape delusional persecutors) and those where\nany risks apply to the welfare of other people, at some point inthe future, and amount to possibilities (such as a depressed\nwoman who may be neglecting her frail elderly father, for whom\nshe is the sole carer). The former case calls for urgent interven-\ntion, probably via mental health legislation; the latter requires\nengagement over time, preferably in a voluntary way.\nWhile all psychiatric evaluations require some assessment of risk,\nit should be considered in depth whenever the presentation in-\ncludes acts or threats of self-harm or reports of command halluci-nations, the past history includes self-harm or violent behaviour, the\nsocial circumstances show a recent, signi \ufb01cant loss, or the mental\ndisorder is strongly associated with risk (as in severe depression).\nAssessing suicidality is the element of risk assessment that is\nmost often needed. If a patient presents after an act of self-harm\nor overdose, the questions arise naturally ( \u2018What did you want to\nhappen when you took the tablets? Did you expect to die? Is that\nwhat you wanted? How do you feel about that now? Do you still\nfeel you \u2019d be better off dead? Have you had thoughts about\ndoing anything else to harm yourself? \u2019).\nIn other circumstances, the subject will need to be introduced,\nbut do not fear that you may be putting ideas in the patient \u2019s\nmind ( \u2018You \u2019ve told me how bad you have been feeling. Have you\never felt life is not worth living? Have you had any thoughts about\nending your life? How close have you come? What has stopped\nyou acting on those thoughts so far? \u2019).\nCapacity\nAssessing a patient \u2019s decision-making capacity, especially for de-\ncisions relating to medical treatment, is a skill required of all clinicians\nand should not be delegated to psychiatrists. The legal elements\nvary widely between jurisdictions, but there are key clinical principles\nin common. The \ufb01rst is the presumption of capacity :clinicians\nshould treat patients as retaining capacity until it is proven that they\nhave lost it. Secondly, capacity is decision-speci \ufb01c: patients may\nnot be able to understand the risks and bene \ufb01ts of complex medical\ntreatment options while retaining the ability to decide whether or not\nto enter a nursing home. Thirdly, residual capacity should be\nmaximised :i fap a t i e n t \u2019s ability to understand is impaired by sensory\nde\ufb01cits or language barriers, these should be corrected as far as\npossible by glasses, hearing aids and interpreters.\nThe central matters to be assessed are essentially cognitive:\ncan the patient make, understand, remember and communicate\ndecisions about medical treatment or other options before them?\nDetermining that a patient lacks capacity for a particular de-\ncision leads to the next stage: making that decision on their\nbehalf. The key principles here are to ensure that any treatment\nproposed must bene \ufb01t the patient and be the least restrictive\noption available; it should take account of any wishes the patient\nhas previously expressed, as well as the views of family members\nand any other relevant others.\nThe physical examination\nPhysical and mental disorders are associated, so always\nconsider the physical dimension in any patient presenting with a\npsychiatric disorder, and vice versa.

Bear in mind that some physical disorders can\npresent with psychiatric symptoms (such as thyrotoxicosis\nmanifesting as anxiety \u2013look for exophthalmos, lid lag, goitre,\ntachycardia and so on). For older patients with multiple medicalproblems, or those with alcohol dependence and associated\nphysical harm, a more detailed examination is clearly needed.\nIn primary care and acute hospital settings, patients will usually\nundergo physical examination tailored to the presenting problem,\nbut it is important to be aware that some psychiatric disorders\ncan present with physical symptoms, such as panic attacks\nmanifesting as chest pain, shortness of breath and transient\nneurological symptoms.\nCollateral history\nCollateral history is important whenever assessment is limited by:\n\u0081physical illness, acute confusional state or dementia\n\u0081severe learning disability or other mental disorder impairing\ncommunication\n\u0081disturbed, aggressive or otherwise uncooperative behaviour.\nSources of third-party information will usually include family\nand other carers, as well as past and present general practi-\ntioners and other health professionals.

Most were developed in research\nstudies to make a con \ufb01dent diagnosis or to measure a change in\nthe severity of illness. Some require special training; all must be\nused sensibly. In general, scales are too in \ufb02exible and limited in\nscope to replace a well-conducted standard psychiatric inter-\nview, but they can be useful adjuncts for screening, measuring\nresponse to treatment or focusing on particular areas.In routine practice, scales are most widely used to assess\ncognitive function when an organic brain disorder is suspected.\nThey include:\n\u0081Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT): takes less than 5 minutes\n(Box 16.11 )\n\u00814A\u2019s test (4AT): takes less than 2 minutes ( the4at.com )\n\u0081Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive\nAssessment (MoCA): takes 5 \u201315 minutes.\nWell-known instruments assessing areas other than cognition\ninclude:\n\u0081general morbidity:\n\u0081General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)\n\u0081mood disorder:\n\u0081Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\n\u0081Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)\n\u0081alcohol:\n\u0081CAGE questionnaire ( Box 16.12 )\n\u0081FAST questionnaire ( Box 16.13 ).\nPutting it all together: clinical\nvignettes\nExamples in practice are provided in Boxes 16.14 \u201316.17 .\n16.10 Personality disorder: de \ufb01nition\nPatterns of experience and behaviour that are:\n\u0081pathological (i.e. outside social norms)\n\u0081problematic (for the patient and/or others)\n\u0081pervasive (affecting most or all areas of a patient \u2019s life)\n\u0081persistent (adolescent onset, enduring throughout adult life and\nresistant to treatment)16.12 The CAGE questionnaire\n\u0081Cut down: Have you ever felt that you should cut down on your drinking?\n\u0081Annoyed: Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking?\n\u0081Guilty: Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?\n\u0081Ever: Do you ever have a drink \ufb01rst thing in the morning, to steady you\nor help a hangover (an \u2018eye opener \u2019)?\nPositive answers to two or more questions suggest problem drinking;con\ufb01rm this by asking about the maximum taken.16.11 The Abbreviated Mental Test\n\u0081Age\n\u0081Date of birth\n\u0081Time (to the nearest hour)\n\u0081Year\n\u0081Hospital name\n\u0081Recognition of two people, e.g. doctor, nurse\n\u0081Recall address\n\u0081Dates of First World War (or other culturally appropriate signi \ufb01cant event)\n\u0081Name of the monarch/prime minister/president or other culturally\nappropriate \ufb01gure)\n\u0081Count backwards 20 \u20131\nEach question scores 1 mark; a score of 8/10, or less, indicates confusion.\nFrom Hodkinson HM.

Risk assessment shouldconcentrate on the risk to others about whom the patient has paranoid\nfears. Neither a detailed cognitive assessment nor a speci \ufb01c rating scale\nis likely to add much to the initial assessment.376 \u0081PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND LEARNING DISABILITY"

            "Text": "The frail patient\nA frail person typically suffers from multimorbidity (multiple ill-\nnesses) and has associated polypharmacy (multiple medica-\ntions). They often have cognitive impairment, visual and hearing\nloss, low bodyweight, poor mobility due to muscular weakness,\nunstable balance and poor exercise tolerance. Their general\nfunctional reserve and the capacity of individual organs and\nphysiological systems are impaired, making the individual\npotentially vulnerable to the effects of minor illnesses. Frailty is\nlikely to be a response to chronic disease and the ageing\nprocess.\nWhilst frailty increases with advancing age and is usually seen\nin older patients, it can also occur in younger people.\nIdentifying frailty proactively can help target those patients who\nwill bene \ufb01t from specialised assessment and management.\nThere are many tools available to identify and stratify the level of\nfrailty. One commonly used scale is the Clinical Frailty Scale,\nwhich uses an individual \u2019s functional ability and level of de-\npendency to determine their degree of frailty ( Fig. 17.1 ).Assessment of the frail patient\nWhen an individual is identi \ufb01ed as frail, Comprehensive Geriatric\nAssessment is an evidence-based process that improves out-\ncomes. It involves taking a history from the patient and, with the\npatient \u2019s consent, from a carer or relative, followed by a sys-\ntematic assessment of:\n\u0081cognitive function and mood\n\u0081nutrition and hydration\n\u0081skin\n\u0081pain\n\u0081continence\n\u0081hearing and vision\n\u0081functional status.\nThe extent and focus of the assessment depend on the clinical\npresentation.

Seek any new symptoms\nor signs of disease and any changes from baseline physical or\ncognitive function.\nThe complexity of the problems presented and the need for\ncomprehensive and systematic analysis mean that assess-\nment is divided into multipl e components, undertaken at\ndifferent times by different members of the multiprofessionalteam ( Box 17.1 ).\nFactors in \ufb02uencing presentation and history\nClassical patterns of symptoms and signs still occur in the frail\npatient, but modi \ufb01ed or non-speci \ufb01c presentations are very\ncommon due to comorbidity, drug treatment and ageing itself.\nAs the combination of these factors is unique for each indi-\nvidual, presentations will be different in each patient. Somegeneral patterns can be recognised, however ( Fig. 17.2 ). The\n\ufb01rst sign of new illness may be a change in functional status:\ntypically, reduced mobility, altered cognition or impairment of\nbalance leading to falls. Common precipitants are infections,\nchanges in medication and metabolic derangements, but\nalmost any acute medical illness can produce these non-\nspeci \ufb01c presentations. Each of these presentations shouldbe explored through careful history taking, physical examina-\ntion and functional assessment.\nCommunication dif \ufb01culties, cognition\nand mood\nDisorders of communication, cognition and mood are common\nand should always be considered at the start of the assessment\nof a frail adult.\nCommunication can be challenging for a variety of reasons\n(Box 17.2 ). As a result, the history can be incomplete, dif \ufb01cult to\ninterpret or misleading, and the whole assessment, including\nphysical examination, may be more time-consuming.\nWhenever possible, assess the patient somewhere quiet with\nfew distractions. Introduce yourself clearly, make your patient\ncomfortable and ensure that they understand the purpose of\nyour contact. Provide any glasses, hearing aids or dentures that\nthey need and help them to switch on and adjust their hearing\naid if necessary. If they still cannot hear you, use an electronic\ncommunicator, or if they can read easily, write down simple\nquestions and instructions.\nCognitive function includes the processes of perception,\nattention, memory, reasoning, decision-making and problem\nsolving (p. 320). Cognitive impairment increases with age and has\nimplications for assessment, treatment, consent and prognosis.\nConsider cognitive impairment if a patient who appears to hear\nyou has limited ability to cooperate with you, cannot recall their\nmedical history or provides no speci \ufb01c symptoms. Other prob-\nlems, including low mood or dysphasia, can mimic cognitive\nimpairment. Some patients present with apparently good social\nskills or \u2018fa\u00e7ade \u2019and cover their impaired memory by diverting the\nconversation to another topic. Never ascribe changes in cognition\nto age alone, without excluding dementia or delirium (p. 377).\nDepression is common in frail people and may be dif \ufb01cult to\ndiagnose. Consider this if your patient struggles to concentrate,\nis withdrawn or is reluctant to interact. Standardised rating scales\nare available, such as the Geriatric Depression Scale. A formal\npsychiatric assessment may help.\nPatients are often fearful that they will be admitted to the\nhospital or not return home after admission, and they may17.1 The multiprofessional team\nProfessional Key roles in assessment of\nPhysician Physical state, including diagnosis and\ntherapeutic intervention\nPsychiatrist Cognition, mood and capacityPhysiotherapist Mobility, balance, gait and falls riskOccupational therapist Practical functional activities (self-care and\ndomestic)\nNurse Skin health, nutrition and continenceDietician NutritionSpeech and language\ntherapistSpeech and swallowing\nSocial worker Social care needs\nInfection Metabolic\nproblemsDrugs Other\nprecipitants\nFunctional decompensation of the frail adult\nDelirium Immobility Falls\nFig. 17.2 Functional decompensation in frail people.17.2 Communication dif \ufb01culties: the seven Ds\nProblem Comment/causes\nDeafness Nerve or conductive\nDysphasia Most commonly due to stroke disease but sometimes a\nfeature of dementia\nDysarthria Cerebrovascular disease, motor neuron disease,\nParkinson0s disease\nDysphonia Parkinson0s disease\nDementia Global impairment of cognitive functionDelirium Impaired attention, disturbance of arousal and perceptual\ndisturbances\nDepression May mimic dementia or deliriumAssessment of the frail patient \u0081381\n17"

Physical examination is easiest when your patientcan comply with your instructions. All patients bene \ufb01t from clear,\ncareful instruction, and this is particularly important for the frail,\nwho may have communication problems or \ufb01nd the examination\nroutine demanding. Many have low levels of stamina and their\nmovement may be limited. Integrate your physical examination to\nminimise movement for patients and maximise their under-\nstanding and cooperation. Help them to move around the room\nand to get on and off the examination couch. Remember thatthey will take longer to undress and dress. Most patients feel\nmore comfortable if a family member, carer or friend is present,\nand always check if this is what they wish. If the patient has\nattended alone, always ask if they would like a chaperone to be\npresent too.\nUse the physical examination to \ufb01nd evidence of established\ncomorbidities and explanations for functional problems, current\nsymptoms, or concerns voiced by a carer. Some frail people\nhave dif \ufb01culty maintaining personal hygiene, grooming or\nappearance. Their hair and clothes may be unclean, nails un-\nkempt and facial hair longer than in younger life.

On admission\nto hospital, many frail patients have skin wounds that have\nbeen dressed in the community. Always remove these\ndressings with the help of a nurse, and assess the underlying\nlesion.\nFrail patients with limited mobility are vulnerable to the rapid\ndevelopment of pressure sores, particularly when acutely ill.Standardised assessment scores such as the Waterlow score\nhelp identify patients at risk of skin breakdown.Pain behaviour\nIn patients with impairment of communication or cognition, al-ways look for pain-related behaviour, as the patient may not\nvolunteer or admit to pain or discomfort ( Box 17.6 ).\nVision and hearing\nHearing loss and visual symptoms, including impairment of\nvisual acuity, are common ( Box 17.7 ) but often overlooked,\nand this can adversely affect communication, interaction and\nfunction.\nUse a Snellen chart or ask the patient to read from a\nnewspaper to assess their vis ion. Hearing loss may be mis-\ninterpreted as cognitive impairment and vice versa. Make sure\nthat the external auditory meatus is not blocked with wax.\nEnsure that patients wear their hearing aids with a functioning\nbattery. Assess hearing using th e whispered voice test if they\ndo not have hearing aids (p. 197).\nSystems examination\nFully examine each system as outlined in previous chapters, andbe aware of differences found in the frail older patient compared\nto younger patients.17.5 Assessment of dehydration\nClassical feature\nof dehydration Interpretation in frail patients\nPostural hypotension Less speci \ufb01c than in younger patients; may be\ncaused by drugs, disease or age-related abnormalautonomic responses to postural change\nDecreased skin turgor Decreased collagen elasticity and reduced\nsubcutaneous fat can mimic reduced turgor.Best assessed at the sternum\nImpaired capillary\nre\ufb01ll timeLess reliable in the frail because less speci \ufb01c\nDry mouth A non-speci \ufb01c\ufb01nding caused by other\nproblems, such as anticholinergic drugs ormouth breathing\nTachycardia in\nhypovolaemiaLess sensitive due to drug- or age-related\nabnormal autonomic responsesMUST actions\nLow risk = routine careMedium risk = document dietary intake for 3 days and reviewHigh risk = refer to dietician and discuss active treatment measuresUnplanned weight\nloss in past\n3\u20136 months\n\u2022 <5% = score 0\n\u2022 5\u201310% = score 1\u2022 >10% = score 2\nMUST score\n0 = low risk\n1 = medium risk\n2 = high riskBMI kg/m\n2\n\u2022 >20 = score 0\n\u2022 18.5\u201320 = score 1\u2022 <18.5 = score 2Acutely ill and\nunlikely to eat\nfor >5 days?\n\u2022 If yes = score 2\nFig. 17.3 The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score for\nassessment of risk of malnutrition.

A widened pulse\npressure occurs because there is decreased arterial compliance.Isolated systolic hypertension and postural hypotension occur\nmore frequently. The latter may result from age-relatedbaroreceptor re \ufb02ex change, disease or drugs. It may not be\nsymptomatic but increases the risk of a fall.\nMedial sclerosis and arterial calci \ufb01cation can make it dif \ufb01cult to\nfeel peripheral pulses but do not cause impaired perfusion and\ncirculation in isolation. The carotid artery may become more\ntortuous and its pulsations more easily visible. This can create a\nfalse impression of arterial dilatation.\nAtrial contribution to left ventricular \ufb01lling increases with age,\npartly due to diastolic dysfunction of the heart, and a fourth heart\nsound (S\n4) is more commonly heard.\nRespiratory examination\nLocalised crackles are common, and although they may notrepresent acute disease, you should never disregard new res-\npiratory pathology as a possible cause.\nGastrointestinal examination\nDry mouth and tongue are common side effects of drugs andmay affect taste and swallowing. Abnormal dentition, oral thrush\nor mouth ulcers may reduce oral intake and nutrition.\nNeurological examination\nCognitive impairment may reduce the accuracy of the history andaffect consent for investigation and treatment. Impaired vibration\nand position sense occur in old age and may impair balance and\nincrease the risk of falls. Always exclude correctable causes such\nas vitamin B\n12de\ufb01ciency. Bilateral absent ankle re \ufb02exes may be\nnormal, but unilateral loss is likely to indicate pathology.\nAsymmetry of tone, re \ufb02exes or power may relate to cerebro-\nvascular disease. If tone is increased, look for additional tremors\nand the variation in tone on passive movement (cogwheeling)\nthat might indicate extrapyramidal disease. Tremors and other\ninvoluntary movements are common, with essential tremors and\nextrapyramidal disease being the most frequent causes.\nMusculoskeletal examination\nLow muscle mass is a frailty indicator and a risk factor for falls.Osteoarthritic changes in the hands and weight-bearing joints\nmay predispose to falls or unsteadiness, even if relatively\nasymptomatic or painless. Gouty tophi may be asymptomatic\nand re \ufb02ect underlying renal dysfunction and in \ufb02uence the choice\nof drug therapy. Kyphosis often occurs from painless osteopo-\nrotic vertebral collapse and may affect postural stability andrespiratory function.\nAlways examine the feet. Bunions, onychomycosis with or\nwithout nail overgrowth, and foot ulcers are common. All can\ncompromise mobility and stability, be a source of sepsis or\npain, and affect gait. Observe your patient walking. A wide\nvariety of pathologies can produce distinctive abnormalities in\ngait, including Parkinson\n0s disease (see Fig. 7.17). Gait ab-\nnormalities are a risk factor for falls and can exacerbate joint\nproblems.17.6 Signs and behaviour associated with pain\nType Description\nAutonomic\nchangesPallor, sweating, tachypnoea, altered breathing\npatterns, tachycardia, hypertension\nFacial expressions Grimacing, wincing, frowning, rapid blinking, brow\nraising, brow lowering, cheek raising, eyelidtightening, nose wrinkling, lip corner pulling, chinraising, lip puckering\nBody movements Altered gait, pacing, rocking, hand wringing,\nrepetitive movements, increased tone, guarding,\na\nbracingb\nVerbalisation/vocalisationSighing, grunting, groaning, moaning, screaming,\ncalling out, aggressive/offensive speech\nInterpersonal\ninteractionsAggression, withdrawal, resistance\nChanges in activity\npatternsWandering, altered sleep, altered rest patterns\nMental status\nchangesConfusion, crying, distress, irritability\naGuarding \u00bcabnormal stiff, rigid or interrupted movement while\nchanging position.\nbBracing \u00bca stationary position in which a fully extended limb\nmaintains and supports an abnormal weight distribution for at least 3\nseconds.\n17.7 Sensory problems\nSensory modality Underlying disease process\nVisual\nLoss of near vision\n(presbyopia)Common in older age because lens is less\npliable\nLoss of central vision Macular degenerationLoss of peripheral\nvisionGlaucoma\nStroke disease (homonymous hemianopia)\nGlare from lights at\nnightCataracts\nEye pain Glaucoma\nAuditory\nHigh-frequency loss Presbyacusis\nConductive deafness more common due tootosclerosis\nGeneralised loss Conductive \u2013otosclerosis, wax\nNerve \u2013Paget\n0s disease, drug-induced\nototoxicity, acoustic neuroma386 \u0081THE FRAIL PATIENT"

This can occur at any stage of a patient \u2019s\nillness but is more common if the patient has been admitted as\nan emergency case, has undergone surgery or has spent time\nin a high-dependency or intensive care setting. Common cau-\nses for deterioration include urinary and chest sepsis, bleeding,\nmyocardial infarction, hypoglycaemia and pulmonary\nembolism.\nEarly assessment and intervention are required, as these pa-\ntients are at a high risk of cardiac arrest. Once this occurs, only\n20% of patients survive up to hospital discharge.\nVital signs\nPhysiological observations that are routinely monitored in\npatients who are admitted to hospital include respiratory rate,\noxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature\nand level of consciousness. Additional monitoring may\ninclude urine output, pain assessment and blood glucose\ntesting.\nEarly warning scores\nVital signs are recorded using track-and-trigger systems in the\nform of early warning scores designed to assess illness severity.\nObservations regularly recorded include respiratory rate, the level\nof oxygen therapy, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure,\ntemperature and level of consciousness, and scores are\nassigned for physiological derangement in each domain. The\nincreased frequency of observations is recommended for pa-\ntients with abnormal signs, and a rising total score triggers a\ngraded response.\nIn the UK, there is a validated track-and-trigger system, the\nNational Early Warning Score (NEWS2; Fig. 18.1 ).

Thus attending to this patient\nshould be prioritised; do not wait to \ufb01nish other tasks.

It is usually appropriate to obtain a\nportable chest X-ray in a breathless or hypoxic patient.\nC: Circulation\nConsider hypovolaemia as the most probable cause of shock inany acutely unwell patient.\nExamination sequence\n\u0081Look at and feel the skin; in hypovolaemic shock, the patient\nwill be cold, and those with lighter skin colours may have\npale, white or mottled skin.\n\u0081Check capillary re \ufb01ll by pressing on a \ufb01ngertip (held at the\nlevel of the heart) for 5 seconds. This will cause it to blanch.\nWhen the pressure is released, the colour should return to\nthe \ufb01ngertip in less than 2 seconds. This is roughly the\nsame time as it takes you to say \u2018capillary re \ufb01ll time \u2019.I f\ncapillary re \ufb01ll is delayed, this indicates poor peripheral\nperfusion or shock.\n\u0081Assess the pulse rate and rhythm (p. 51). A heart rate of less\nthan 50 beats per minute (bpm) or more than 100 bpm re-quires further investigation. A heart rate of more than\n120 bpm requires immediate attention as this may indicate an\nabnormal rhythm.\n\u0081Palpate peripheral and central pulses, assessing the volume\nand character (p. 52); poorly felt peripheral pulses may indi-\ncate hypovolaemia or poor cardiac output, whereas abounding pulse may indicate sepsis. As blood pressure falls,peripheral pulses diminish, with loss of the radial, then femoral\nand \ufb01nally carotid pulsation. As a rule of thumb, if the radial\npulse is present, the systolic blood pressure is likely to begreater than 90 mmHg, but once the femoral pulse becomesimpalpable, the systolic blood pressure is likely to be less\nthan 60 mmHg.\n\u0081Attach an ECG monitor to the patient to assess their heart\nrate and rhythm. A 12-lead ECG should also be recorded inpatients with suspected acute coronary syndrome or\narrhythmia.\n\u0081Check the blood pressure (p. 55). Hypotension is a late and\nserious sign, particularly in young patients who can\ncommonly maintain blood pressure by peripheral\nvasoconstriction.\n\u0081Examine the jugular venous pressure (p. 57). This may be\nchallenging in a tachycardic or tachypnoeic patient.\n\u0081Auscultate the heart to identify added sounds or murmurs (p.\n81).\n\u0081Insert one or more wide-bore (14- or 16-gauge) intravenous\ncannulae, and take blood for routine haematological,\nbiochemical and coagulation tests and for cross-matching. If\nthe patient is hypotensive, give a bolus of 250 \u2013500 mL of\nwarmed crystalloid solution.\n\u0081Look for other signs of inadequate organ perfusion such as\nreduced consciousness (see later) and oliguria ( <0.5 mL/kg/\nhour). A \ufb02uid balance chart should be commenced. Consider\nurinary catheterisation. Urinary catheters have their ownassociated morbidity, in particular catheter-associated urinary\ntract infection. However, if the patient is obtunded or unable\nto pass urine, a catheter should be inserted.\nD: Disability\nAny change in a patient \u2019s conscious level should raise concern.\nCauses of unconsciousness can include hypoxia, hypercapnia,\ncerebral hypoperfusion, hypoglycaemia or the use of sedative\nmedications such as opioids.\nConscious level is often recorded using the AVPU scale, which\ncategorises the patient as:\n\u0081alert\n\u0081responding to voice\n\u0081responding to pain\n\u0081unresponsive.\nThis measure is incorporated into many early warning scores\nand has the advantage of being a fast and easily understood\nverbal description of the patient \u2019s conscious level. It is not\ndesigned as a measure to track small changes in a patient \u2019s\nneurological condition.\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is more sensitive to changes\nin a patient \u2019s conscious level but is more complex. It measures\neye opening, vocal and motor responses ( Box 18.5 ). The GCS\nwas initially validated as a measure of conscious level in patients\nwith traumatic brain injury.

A\nbedside modi \ufb01cation of this is the quickSOFA ( \u2018qSOFA \u2019) score\nwhich allows rapid evaluation of respiratory, cardiovascular and\ncerebrovascular dysfunction. The presence of two or moreqSOFA points (respiratory rate /C2122 breaths per minute, systolic\nblood pressure /C20100 mmHg and/or GCS /C2015) in the presence\nof suspected infection is associated with a greater risk of death\nthan in uncomplicated infection. Septic shock is de \ufb01ned as the\npresence of sepsis and, despite adequate volume resuscitation,\nboth persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain a\nmean arterial pressure /C2165 mmHg and lactate /C212 mmol/L. The\nassessment and initial management of sepsis are described by\nthe \u2018Sepsis Six \u2019screening tool and therapeutic bundle, which\naims to deliver three diagnostic and three therapeutic steps\nwithin 1 hour of the recognition of sepsis ( Boxes 18.6 and18.7 ).\nIn addition to the routine vital signs, the measurement of urine\noutput and lactate is recommended as a guide to illness severity.\nLactate is the product of anaerobic metabolism and is a marker\nof tissue perfusion. A lactate of >2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) is\nabnormal and a level of >4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) is associated with\n30% mortality. A careful search must be undertaken to identify\nthe underlying infection in order to aid diagnosis and guide\nappropriate choice of antibiotics.\nInitial investigations should include the measurement of ABGs,\nglucose and lactate, blood cultures, full blood count, C-reactive\nprotein, urea and electrolytes and a clotting screen.\nTreatment of sepsis with early and appropriate antibiotics,\noxygen and intravenous \ufb02uids reduces mortality. Patients who fail\nto respond to initial treatment are very likely to require a higher\nlevel of care and must be discussed with a senior clinician.\nOngoing management\nThe management of a deteriorating patient must include frequent\nreview of response to therapy. Once you have completed the\nABCDE approach, return to the beginning and reassess, if the\npatient is not improving.\nClear goals of interventions should be communicated to the\nteam (for example, \u2018The goal of this \ufb02uid bolus is to achieve a\nsystolic blood pressure of over 100 mmHg; if this is not achieved,\nplease let me know and we will give a further \ufb02uid bolus \u2019). A\nwritten management plan should be documented, which should\nalso include the required frequency of observations (such as\nevery 15 minutes until stabilised).\nIt is particularly important to work as a team when a patient is\ndeteriorating rapidly. A structured approach to communication\nwill help you organise your thoughts and is an effective way to\ncommunicate the urgency of the situation to the person you are\nescalating to.

Although some deaths are unexpected, the majority are the\nresult of one or more advanced, progressive conditions and\noccur in hospital, at the patient \u2019s home or care home, or in a\nhospice. It is important to identify whether an acute deterioration\nor a new complication from an underlying health problem is\nreversible. This change may represent an anticipated decline and\nindicate that the person is approaching the end of their life.Recognising where a person is on their current illness trajectory\nand identifying their priorities, goals and preferences allows\nshared decisions to be made with the patient and their relatives\nabout what further investigations and treatments are appropriate,\nand about their preferred place of care or death.\nAssessing a dying patient\nPhysiology\nThere are three broad illness trajectories ( Fig. 19.1 ):\n\u0081progression of a life-limiting condition with a clear terminal\nphase: for example, advanced cancer where oncology\ntreatment is no longer of bene \ufb01t or is given for symptom\nmanagement.\n\u0081\ufb02uctuating decline with intermittent, potentially life-\nthreatening, acute exacerbations or complications that may\nresult in death: for example, advanced respiratory, heart,\nkidney or liver disease.\n\u0081prolonged, gradual decline with acute episodes that may be\nthe \ufb01nal illness such as a chest infection: for example, de-\nmentia, general frailty in older age or advanced neurological\nconditions.\nMany physiological and functional changes occur in the \ufb01nal\nweeks or months of life. General indicators of deteriorating health\ninclude:\n\u0081performance status that is poor or worsening, with the per-\nson in bed or in a chair for more than half the day.\u0081increasing number of unplanned hospital attendances or\nadmissions.\n\u0081persistent symptoms despite optimal treatment of underlying\nconditions.\n\u0081progressive weight loss with low muscle mass (cachexia), or\ndif\ufb01culty maintaining normal weight.\n\u0081increasing dependency on others for care and support due to\nphysical and/or mental health problems.\nHaving considered these clinical indicators of deteriorating\nhealth, it can be helpful to ask yourself: \u2018Would I be surprised if\nthis person died in the next few months, weeks or days? \u2019Pa-\ntients may be close to death when they \ufb01rst present or may fail to\nimprove with treatment, so it becomes clear that they will die\nsoon. It is crucial that we recognise when a person is so unwell\nthat they could die.\nIn the last days of life, people eat and drink less, sleep more\nand have physiological changes in breathing patterns, circula-\ntion, and in the level of consciousness.\nThe history\nThe clinician may already know the patient well, for example, ifthey are the general practitioner. If not, it is important to gather\ninformation about the patient \u2019s underlying conditions, presenting\nillness, current and previous treatment, family and social/cultural\ncontext.\nBackground information\nUse all available sources to determine the patient \u2019s previous\nhealth status in addition to their presenting problems. Review\nreferral letters, primary care and hospital records, and previous\ndischarge summaries. Check for advance/anticipatory care\nplans, emergency treatment plans or any advance directive/de-\ncision. Find out if the person has a legally appointed, proxy\ndecision-maker or a registered Power of Attorney. Look for any\nrecord of previous discussions or decisions about cardiopul-\nmonary resuscitation (CPR). Find out if the person has a pace-\nmaker or any other device that will need to be deactivated now or\nremoved after death; record this clearly.\nEstablishing the broader context\nBuild up a picture of the patient \u2019s overall health status and any\nrecent changes, not only the presenting symptoms. A family\nmember or friend can provide valuable additional information and\nsupport the patient. If the patient or family cannot provide in-\nformation, contact someone who knows the person, such as the\ngeneral practitioner, another member of the primary care team,their hospital specialist or any senior nurse involved in their care.\nThe physical examination\nPeople may retain some awareness, even when close to death.\nSpeak to the person by name and to others in the room as you\nwould when your patient is awake.

Even in this situation, a focused examination\nlooking for reversible causes of deterioration is always indicated\n(see the integrated examination sequence at the end of the\nchapter). Common, potentially reversible causes of deterioration in\npeople with advanced conditions are shown in Box 19.1 .Some patients will bene \ufb01t from carefully selected investigations\nto con \ufb01rm whether their condition is reversible, to guide speci \ufb01c\npalliative treatments or to clarify the prognosis.\nCare in the last days of life\nIf the patient is likely to die soon, their care needs to be planned.Anticipate and address potential problems with symptom man-\nagement and emotional distress. This includes making sure\nsuitable medications are prescribed and available, regularly and\nas needed. Treatments for underlying conditions need careful\nreview to avoid burdening people with medications that are no\nlonger of bene \ufb01t while continuing to manage symptoms effec-\ntively. It is important to review a patient who is dying at least daily,\nand more often if they are unsettled or have complex clinical\nproblems. If a patient deteriorates rapidly or their symptoms\nchange, urgent assessment is required. Find out if the otherpeople who are caring for the dying patient have any concerns,\nespecially family members who are caring for the person at\nhome, and work with them to maintain the patient \u2019s comfort and\ndignity. Involve and support family members and close friends. A\nclear explanation of the dying process, good communication and\neffective palliative care from the multidisciplinary team helps\nfamilies prepare for the person \u2019s death and improves outcomes\nfor the bereaved.\nCultural, religious and spiritual care are very important when a\nperson is dying, around the time of death and afterwards. Always\nask the person and those close to them about how they would\nlike to be cared for and what you and other staff members can\ndo to help support them. This may include making plans for\nvisiting by family members and/or a spiritual care provider,\nspeci \ufb01c wishes about how the person is touched or cared for\nafter death, and funeral arrangements.\nCommunication with patients and families\nIf you believe a patient could be approaching the end of their life,it is important to share this information with them and their family\nin a timely way so that they have opportunities to address per-\nsonal priorities and concerns. The 6-step REDMAP framework is\nrecommended to guide conversations about treatment and care\nat the end of life ( Box 19.2 ). It includes helpful words and phrases\nthat can be adapted to the person, their family and the context of\nthe conversation. Begin by \ufb01nding out what people know and\nexpect before sharing information in small chunks, with pauses.\nNext, explore what matters to this person and their family, then\ndiscuss treatment and care that takes account of available op-\ntions and the person \u2019s priorities, and agree on an individualised\ncare plan.\nMany countries now have policies and processes for decision\nmaking about treatments at the end of life, and speci \ufb01cally for\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Decisions are based on a\nclinical assessment of treatment bene \ufb01ts, burdens and out-\ncomes but also involve shared decision-making discussions with\npatients and/or legally appointed proxies.

If a patient has advanced illness and is dying,\nCPR will not have a medically successful outcome. Ask what the\npatient and family know about CPR. Explain that CPR is a\ntreatment to restart the heart and/or breathing after they have\nstopped, which does not work when a person is dying. It is\nbetter to focus on planning good care. Be clear that any othertreatments that can help the person will still be offered. Do not\nask people if they \u2018want \u2019to be resuscitated when it is not a\nrealistic treatment option for them. Occasionally, a patient with\none or more advanced conditions deteriorates more rapidly than\nexpected or a decision that CPR will not be given has not been\nmade in advance. In those situations, professionals present must\ndecide if CPR should not start or be stopped.\nExplain what happens when a person is dying. Talk about\nchanges that may be seen and what they mean.

Plan visiting arrangements suited\nto this person and their family and \ufb01nd out who to contact if the\npatient deteriorates or dies. Explain what to expect whensomeone dies and what to do if the person is at home. Most\npeople stop breathing gradually but may take a \ufb01nal breath after\na long pause. A brief muscle spasm may be observed at that\ntime, so warn relatives about this.\nVerifying and certifying death\nThe veri \ufb01cation and medical certi \ufb01cation of death are important\nto allow the legal requirements and cultural and religious tradi-\ntions that happen after a person has died to be completed in a\ntimely way. Some people will have decided to be organ or tissue\ndonors in advance or be eligible under \u2018opt-out \u2019legislation in\nsome countries.

Being aware of whether the death\nwas sudden or expected and how the person has been during\ntheir \ufb01nal illness helps you to prepare. Check with clinical col-\nleagues whether there is anything you should know about this\npatient and family.\nThe physical examination\nAfter the person has died, it is important for the clinical team tocontinue to care for them as they would any other patient. This\nincludes speaking about the person by name to family members\nwho are present at the time of death or while you are carrying out\nthe examination to verify death. As some relatives choose to\nremain in the room, you need to explain each part of the ex-\namination in simple terms and conduct it in a respectful and\nprofessional manner.\nTo verify death, clinical examination and observation should\ntake place over a minimum of 5 minutes to establish that\nirreversible cardiorespiratory arrest has occurred.

They should have experience in the assessment of\nbrainstem function. One of the doctors must be a consultant or\nequivalent senior physician. The tests are performed on two\noccasions. The \ufb01rst set of tests is to diagnose brainstem death.\nThe second set is to con \ufb01rm the diagnosis. There is no minimum\ntime required between tests; they can occur concurrently. If thetests demonstrate that brain death has occurred, then the time\nof death is recorded as the time when the \ufb01rst set of tests was\ncompleted.\nCommunication with families\nCommunicating with family members to tell them that someone\nhas died should be done as soon as possible. If in hospital,\nspeak to relatives in a quiet, private room and try to avoidinterruptions. If the death is sudden and unexpected, this will\nbe breaking bad news so needs clear and sensitive commu-\nnication. When contacting a family member by telephone to\ninform them of a patient \u2019s death, it is important to decide if it is\nsafe to do so or whether it would be better to contact\nsomeone such as the police and ask them to go and inform\nthe family member in person. Explain what has happened and\nwhat will happen next. Offer the family time with the person\nwho has died if they wish. Respect and support cultural or\nreligious requirements after death and ensure you are aware of\nany plans already made with the patient and family. Rapid\nprovision of the medical certi \ufb01cate of death is important for\nsome faith groups.Medical certi \ufb01cation of death\nDocument the place, time and date of death in the patient \u2019s\nmedical record. In some countries, the time of death is when the\nperson was observed to have died by those present or the\nperson was found to have died. In other countries, the time of\ndeath is when death is veri \ufb01ed by a doctor or another suitably\ntrained health professional, so make sure you know which time\nto record. Include details of who was present when the person\ndied and what the primary and secondary causes of death were.\nIn hospital, the cause of death must be discussed and con \ufb01rmed\nwith a senior colleague, usually a consultant. Some medical\ncerti \ufb01cates of death require additional information, such as the\nduration of the \ufb01nal illness, so make sure you are familiar with\nthese requirements. You should also know or seek advice about\nwhen a medical certi \ufb01cate of death should not be issued\nbecause the death has to be reported for further investigation\n(Box 19.3 ).\nLooking after yourself and others\nAlthough caring for a patient who is dying and their family is\nextremely rewarding, it can also be stressful and emotionally\ndemanding. It is important to recognise this and look for help\nand personal support when you need it. You may need advice\non how to manage a patient \u2019s symptoms, decide on a care\nplan or communicate sensitively and effectively with people who\nare experiencing loss and bereavement. Talk to your medical\ncolleagues and other members of the healthcare team and\nsupport them too. If a death has been particularly challenging, a\nsenior clinician may invite the team members involved to take\npart in a debrie \ufb01ng session soon after the death or later. This is\nan opportunity for everyone to share how they are feeling and\ntalk about what the team and service can learn from the\nsituation.\n19.3 Deaths that may require further investigation\n\u0081The cause of death is unknown.\n\u0081Death was violent or unnatural.\n\u0081Death was sudden and unexplained.\n\u0081The person who died was not visited by a medical practitioner during their \ufb01nal illness.\n\u0081A medical certi \ufb01cate is not available.\n\u0081Death occurred during an operation or before the person came round from the anaesthetic.\n\u0081The medical certi \ufb01cate suggests that the death may have been caused by an industrial disease or industrial poisoning.\n\u0081Death occurred in legal custody.\n\u0081A complaint has been received over the medical treatment or standards of care received by the deceased.\n\u0081Death was due to a noti \ufb01able disease.Looking after yourself and others \u0081409\n19"

He \u2019s been in hospital\nthree times over the last year with chest infections and never really seemed to get back to where he was before. This time he has a severe chest\ninfection sometimes called pneumonia. \u201d\n\u0081Explain that, because Mr. Jenkins has advanced lung disease and is not responding to treatment, he is likely to deteriorate further.\n\u2013\u201cWe were hoping that your dad would improve with the antibiotics and oxygen on the ward, but we are worried about how he is doing. It is possible\nhe will not get better this time. He has been seen by his own consultant and a senior doctor from the intensive care unit who agree that his\nunderlying lung condition and the pneumonia are the reason for this. \u201d\n\u0081Pause.\n\u0081Explain that this means Mr. Jenkins is likely to die.\n\u2013\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he could die soon with this illness. \u201d\n\u0081Pause to give Kiron time to respond. Address any concerns or questions Kiron may have. Explore what would be important for Mr. Jenkins and his family.\n\u2013\u201cYour dad is not able to tell us what would be important for him and his family.

Explain about stopping treatments that will no longer be bene \ufb01cial and having \u2018as needed \u2019medications available.\n\u0081Ask if Kiron knows about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR. Explain that when a person dies, their heart and breathing stop. Giving treatment to\nrestart the heart does not work in this situation and is, therefore, not the best way to care for them.

            "Text": "History taking, examination and investigation are the methods by\nwhich clinicians gather information to allow them to understand\npatients \u2019problems. Clinical reasoning is the analytical process by\nwhich this information is translated into diagnoses, therapeutic\npossibilities and prognoses. This chapter addresses how the\nclinical skills described in this book enable clinicians to reach\ndiagnoses and other clinical decisions and communicate these\nto patients and colleagues in everyday practice.\nReaching a diagnosis\nDoctors recognise patterns of symptoms and signs, then apply\nclinical reasoning to interpret them and formulate diagnostic\npossibilities or probabilities. Sometimes, doctors instantlyrecognise a condition based on previous experience ( \u2018spot di-\nagnoses \u2019, p. 38). Visual patterns are particularly likely to lead to\nsuch recognition: for example, a typical rash. More commonly,\nelements of the history and examination together trigger pattern\nrecognition. This process relies on comparing a patient \u2019s pre-\nsentation to cases encountered before and remembered as\nillness scripts. With increasing experience, less typical pre-\nsentations are encountered and recalled, and doctors are\nincreasingly able to recognise more exceptional cases.\nPretest probability\nWhen doctors are unable to recognise patterns in presentationsquickly, various re \ufb01nement strategies are used to arrange the\npossible diagnoses in order of probability. The pretest probability\nof a disease is the proportion of people in a population at risk\nwho have the disease. For an individual with a new symptom, the\npretest probability of disease depends on the context in which\nthe symptom has appeared because the prevalence of disease\nvaries between populations. In general practice populations, the\nincidence of serious disease, for example, colorectal cancer, is\nmuch lower than in hospital populations, although serious con-\nditions still usually need to be excluded. In practice, the pretest\nprobability of a disease is the clinician \u2019s judgment of the likeli-\nhood of a particular disease based on the information gathered\nto date and their understanding of the context in which they\nwork. Clinicians need a mental map of how likely different dis-\neases are and how those probabilities shift as they gather and\nsynthesise information. This may involve identi \ufb01cation of \u2018red\ufb02ag\u2019\nor\u2018alarm \u2019symptoms and signs of serious disease, for example,\nor the use of clinical prediction rules, such as the Wells score for\ndeep vein thrombosis. Positive \u2018alarm \u2019features or above-\nthreshold prediction scores increase the probability of a dis-\nease in individuals and generally trigger further investigation.\nClinicians also rely on understanding the sensitivity, speci \ufb01city\nand predictive value of symptoms for the diagnosis of a particular\ncondition in the population with which they work. For example,\nchest pain is a highly sensitive symptom in the diagnosis of acute\ncoronary syndromes (ACS) as a high proportion of people who\nhave an eventual diagnosis of ACS experience chest pain.\nHowever, it is not a speci \ufb01c symptom as many people who do\nnot have an eventual diagnosis of ACS will also have chest pain.If the presence of chest pain alone were used to diagnose, ACS\nwould therefore be overdiagnosed. The predictive value of\nsymptoms is more useful in clinical practice than either sensitivity\nor speci \ufb01city as it predicts the likelihood that a person with a\nparticular symptom has the associated condition. Like pretest\nprobability, it is affected by the prevalence of the disease in the\npopulation. For example, the positive predictive value of rectal\nbleeding in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is higher in olderpopulations than in younger ones.\nAdditional factors affecting the pretest probability of disease in\npatients with the same presenting symptoms include age,\ngender, past medical history, family history and lifestyle. Few\ndoctors use formal probabilistic reasoning in making diagnoses,\nbut most know the relationship between these factors and the\nlikelihood of a speci \ufb01c disease and use this understanding intu-\nitively to select likely diagnoses to subject to hypothetico-\ndeductive reasoning ( Fig. 20.1 ). Initial history, examination and\ninvestigation results are used to develop a list of possible di-\nagnoses \u2013the hypotheses. Further history, examination and\ninvestigation are used to support or refute each of these putative\ndiagnoses until a \ufb01nal diagnosis is determined. Returning to\nclarify the history or re-examine matters when signs are ambig-\nuous allows an iterative approach and more accurate diagnosis.\nRare diseases\nWhile diagnosis by probability works in most cases, rare dis-eases also occur, and to the affected patients and their families,\nthey are not rare. Avoid the trap of thinking that all patients have\ncommon conditions, and symptoms that do not \ufb01t with common\ndiagnoses are less important.

The art is to listen\ncarefully, keep an open mind and pick up the uncommon situ-\nation when the usual patterns of presentation really do not \ufb01t the\nfacts of a case.\nMultimorbidity\nThe application of clinical skills in diagnosis is complicated whenpatients have multiple morbidity. New symptoms arise in the\ncontext of existing physical and psychological illness and may\nrepresent new manifestations or complications of a known\ncondition, of more than one known condition, or of a new dis-\nease altogether. Typically, patients with multiple morbidities do\nnot experience their diseases discretely and therefore may report\nsymptoms in an indistinct or incoherent way. Furthermore, their\nsymptoms might interact with each other, and present differentlycompared to a single disease. Faced with this atypical pattern of\nsymptoms, it is not easy for clinicians to reach distinct\ndiagnoses.\nDiagnostic error\nDiagnosis is not easy, and all clinicians, irrespective of expertise,\nmake diagnostic errors. Errors are more common when pre-\nsentations are atypical or nonspeci \ufb01c, when patients have\ncomorbidities, or when the underlying condition is rare. Most\nerrors occur because of defects in diagnostic thinking, of which\nthe most common error is heuristic-based thinking. Heuristics\nare cognitive shortcuts used to solve problems; they are quick\nand re \ufb02exive and used to generate an approximate answer to a\nreasoning question. They are used, for example, in spot diag-\nnosis, pattern recognition and hypothetico-deductive ap-\nproaches but are prone to produce error by disproportionately\ndiagnosing conditions that are at the forefront of the clinician \u2019s\nmind. This could be due to:\n\u0081seeing several recent cases\n\u0081missing a diagnosis\n\u0081settling on a hypothetical diagnosis without gathering enough\ninformation to con \ufb01rm or refute it\n\u0081interpreting new information in a way that supports rather\nthan refutes a hypothetical diagnosis, or\n\u0081using stereotyping or pro \ufb01ling in clinical reasoning, for\nexample, deciding that a drug-using patient presenting withback pain is seeking drugs rather than investigating the cause\nof their pain.\nMany strategies have been proposed to debias diagnostic\nthinking. Metacognition is one such strategy. It promotes\nawareness and understanding of your own thinking as a way of\nrecognising and minimising unconscious bias or errors. It en-\ncourages you to check for con \ufb02icting evidence and consider\nalternatives to the decision you have arrived at. For example, in\nreaching a diagnosis, it may be helpful to stop and ask yourself:\n\u0081\u2018What else could this be? \u2019\n\u0081\u2018How much is my decision being in \ufb02uenced by the fact I am\nrunning late? \u2019\u0081\u2018How much is my decision being in \ufb02uenced by the patient I\nmisdiagnosed last week? \u2019\nAs a re \ufb02ective process, metacognition can be learnt and\npractised.\nBiopsychosocial model\nMuch of this book deals with the association between a patient \u2019s\nhistory and examination \ufb01ndings and the presence of underlying\ndisease that can be viewed independently from the person who\nis suffering from it. However, patients often experience symp-\ntoms that either cannot be explained wholly by disease or occur\nin the absence of underlying pathology altogether. Symptoms\nare, consequently, not synonymous with disease but subjective\nexperiences with many possible sources: pathological, physio-\nlogical, psychological, cultural, behavioural and external. There-\nfore, understanding what has caused a patient to be ill often\nrequires the clinician to consider their symptoms within a wider\nbiopsychosocial framework rather than a limited biomedical one.\nApproach to the patient with medically\nunexplained symptoms\nSymptoms that impair function but do not \ufb01t characteristic pat-\nterns of disease and persist despite normal examination and\ninvestigations are often called \u2018functional \u2019,\u2018medically unexplained\nsymptoms \u2019(MUS, Fig. 20.2 ) or, more recently, \u2018persistent\nphysical symptoms \u2019.

            "Text": "general practitioner have MUS, and they are also common in\nsecondary care, although disease prevalence is much higher\nthere. Some symptoms are more likely to be medically unex-\nplained than others: for example, persistent fatigue, abdominal\npain and back pain. The causes of MUS are poorly understood,\nbut various predisposing and precipitating factors ( Box 20.1 )\nmay contribute. Most functional symptoms are transient, but\nsome become persistent, causing similar disability to thoseresulting from disease and also signi \ufb01cant emotional distress. If\nMUS are not recognised and managed appropriately, attempts\nto alleviate them can result in harm from fruitless investigations,\ninappropriate interventions or drugs, and increased fear of\ndisease.\nPatients with MUS commonly feel that clinicians do not think\ntheir symptoms are real, leading to a breakdown in trust between\npatient and clinician and frustration for both. Crucially, clinicians\nmust use an empathic and non-judgemental approach, so the\npatient feels believed. Keep an open mind and accept all the\npatient \u2019s symptoms at face value. Remember that patients with\nMUS may also have or develop disease. Even if a functional\ndiagnosis is suspected, a comprehensive history and examina-\ntion remain imperative. This helps patients to feel that they are\nbeing taken seriously; in addition, organic disease, however\nunlikely, is less likely to be missed.\nPatients \u2019illness beliefs matter hugely and should be explicitly\nacknowledged. What do they think is wrong? Why have they\ncome to you now, and what do they hope you can do for them?\nInconsistencies in the history should be explored with the patient;\nfor example, a patient with severe chest pain and normal coro-\nnary angiography may still \ufb01rmly believe they have angina.\nNormal investigations need to be explained clearly to help\ndemonstrate that the evidence does not support their belief.\nPatients may complain about previous clinicians or treatments.\nAllowing a patient to express dissatisfaction shows interest and\nhelps to avoid suggesting treatments they are likely to reject.\nAlways remain professional and avoid being drawn into criticism\nof other healthcare providers.\nPatients can be acutely sensitive to questions that suggest a\nclinician thinks there is a psychological basis for their symp-\ntoms ( \u2018all in the mind \u2019). Frame questions carefully in terms of\nt h e i rs y m p t o m s :f o re x a m p l e , \u2018Do your symptoms ever make\ny o uf e e ld o w no rf r u s t r a t e d ? \u2019rather than \u2018Do you ever feel\ndepressed? \u2019Abuse is one possible precipitant of MUS but\nseek this history judiciously. Follow local guidelines for any\nabuse you discover.\nThe physical assessment includes observing the patient\nthroughout the consultation. Watch for inconsistent signs,\nalthough this does not indicate whether they are consciously orsubconsciously produced. Usually, there are no physical signs,\nbut some non-pathological signs are associated with MUS; for\ninstance, in irritable bowel syndrome, you may \ufb01nd evidence of\nbloating and some tenderness, but otherwise, gastrointestinal\nexamination will be normal. The history often suggests MUS, so\nfocus on excluding any unexpected physical \ufb01ndings, as well as\ndemonstrating to patients that you are taking them seriously. Any\nsigns you do \ufb01nd may vary between examinations, but overall,\nthe examination is commonly normal with MUS.\nInvestigations are used in MUS mainly to reassure both clini-\ncian and patient. Exhaustive investigations to exclude all physical\nillness are costly and unhelpful, risk side effects, and do not\nreassure patients in the longer term. Before requesting in-\nvestigations, discuss with the patient the likelihood and signi \ufb01-\ncance of a normal result. Patients are more likely to be satis \ufb01ed\nwhen your explanation makes sense to them, removes blame\nand helps to generate ideas about how they can manage their\nsymptoms.\nCommunicating a diagnosis\nClinicians routinely inform patients about new diagnoses, and,\neven if not life threatening, many will be unwelcome to patients.\nInappropriate communication, such as an abrupt or harsh\ndisclosure, can be psychologically devastating to the patient.\nEffectively communicating a diagnosis to a patient requires an\nunderstanding of the key medical and informational needs of the\npatient, and an appreciation of the patient \u2019s prior knowledge and\nbeliefs about their health. Ask, \u2018What do you already know about\nyour illness? \u2019,o r \u2018Would you like me to tell you the details of the\ndiagnosis? \u2019\u2019For disclosure of bad news, it is usual to give a\n\u2018warning shot \u2019(e.g. \u2018I\u2019m afraid I have bad news for you \u2019). Infor-\nmation should be given in small chunks and aligned with what\nthe patient knows or believes already. Misconceptions should be\ncorrected. The language used should be free from medical jar-\ngon. Patients should be given time to absorb the information\ngiven, and clinicians should check their understanding often,\nclarify any misunderstandings and reinforce important informa-\ntion. Responding empathetically to the patient \u2019s emotions at this\nstage allows the patient to feel heard and provides support if the\nnews is bad.\nShared decision-making\nTo share decision-making with the patient about treatment, the\nclinician requires an understanding of the patient \u2019s needs, values,\ngoals and preferences regarding care, including their desired\ndegree of involvement in decision-making. Available options for\ntreatment can then be explored with the patient. Again, infor-\nmation should be given in \u2018\u2018chunks \u2019\u2019and the patient \u2019s under-\nstanding of information checked. Choices should be discussed\nopenly with the patient, and the clinician should be clear about\nthe potential harms and bene \ufb01ts of different treatment options.\nRisk information should be presented numerically whenever\npossible, using consistent denominators (e.g. \u2018Of 100 children20.1 Aetiological factors for medically unexplained\nsymptoms\n\u0081Precipitating: stress, depression, anxiety and sometimes disease and\ninjury, especially if associated with fears of or belief in disease\n\u0081Predisposing: fear of disease from previous experience\n\u0081Perpetuating: inappropriate attempts to alleviate symptoms (e.g.\nexcessive rest) failure to address patient \u2019s concerns418 \u0081REACHING AND COMMUNICATING A DIAGNOSIS"

            "Text": "with otitis media, 84 would be free from pain at 2 to 3 days even\nwithout antibiotics, 11 will not be pain-free even with antibiotics,\nand only 5 will have their pain relieved by receiving antibiotics, so\nantibiotics only help in about 1 in 20 cases. \u2019) For complex in-\nformation such as this, visual decision aids may present infor-\nmation in a way that the patient can better understand; examples\nof these can be found at Dr. Chris Cates \u2019EBM website,\nnntonline.net . Information should be provided in absolute as well\nas relative terms and attention should be paid to the way infor-\nmation is framed. Equivalent information can be more or less\nattractive depending on what features are highlighted, and the\nframing of health information can lead to different decisions and\nhealth behaviours. Positive framing (e.g. chance of survival) is\nmore effective than negative framing (e.g. chance of death) in\npersuading people to take risky treatment options, such as\nsurgery, whereas \u2018loss \u2019framing (e.g. the potential losses from not\nhaving a mammogram) in \ufb02uences screening uptake more than\n\u2018gain \u2019framing.\nPatients should be encouraged to consider \u2018what matters\nmost to them \u2019, and to determine their preferences for treat-\nment. It is often helpful for patients to consider what would\nhappen if they chose not to take up any of the treatment\noptions. Clinicians should accept that patients may not share\ntheir views about the balance of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and side ef-\nfects of treatments. Many studies demonstrate a correlation\nbetween effective clinician-patient communication and\nimproved health outcomes. If patients feel they have been\nlistened to, and understand the problem and proposed\ntreatment plan, they are more likely to follow the plan and less\nlikely to reattend.\nDiagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty\nIn practice, not all diagnoses are reached with certainty despite\ndiligent application of clinical methods and reasoning to patients \u2019\nproblems. Patient frailty may, for example, make de \ufb01nitive tests\ntoo risky. Similarly, treatment choices are not always straight-\nforward even when the diagnosis is clear. For some diseases,\nthere is no clear-cut evidence that one treatment option is su-\nperior to others. Sharing uncertainty about diagnosis and treat-\nment with patients is a key component of patient-centred care\nand goes beyond simple exchange of information. With careful\nexplanation, most patients understand and accept unavoidable\nuncertainty, but in this situation it is especially important to agree\nwith the patient on the appropriate course of action after full\ndiscussion.\nDocumenting your \ufb01ndings\nDocumenting clinical \ufb01ndings in a clear and concise medical\nrecord is a crucial aspect of medical practice. It should include a\nstructured account of the history and examination \u2013both positive\nand important negative \ufb01ndings. Some circumstances demand\nadditional detail: for example, forensic documentation of the\nlength and position of wounds.The appropriate level of detail varies with the context, but you\nshould adopt and use a consistent format. This format quickly\nbecomes a habit, reduces your need to think about what to record\nnext, and lessens the likelihood of forgetting something important. A\nconsistent format also allows others to locate speci \ufb01c information\nquickly in your documentation. An example of clear and concise\nclinical documentation of a case is shown in Fig. 20.3 .\nCommunicating with colleagues\nAn essential part of a clinician \u2019s work is the accurate and timely\nsharing of information about patients with colleagues. Commu-\nnication failures are strong predictors of healthcare-related harm.\nTypical situations include:\n\u0081referral of a patient from the community to a hospital\n(Box 20.2 )\n\u0081request for advice or immediate help\n\u0081discharge of a patient back to the community from a hospital\n(Box 20.3 )\n\u0081outpatient clinic letter to the general practitioner or referring\nconsultant\n\u0081referral of a patient to another consultant\n\u0081referral of a patient to other hospital or community services\n(such as a social work referral or referral to a specialist ser-\nvice, such as palliative care).\nVerbal communication\nVerbal communication about a patient needs to be structured andconcise to be effective. Be clear about your expectations of the\nperson you are communicating with, especially if you are requesting\nthat they do something, such as coming to review the patient.\nSBAR (situation, background, assessment, recommendation)\nis a simple tool to help standardise communication. It is rec-\nommended by the World Health Organization for use as a tool to\nincrease patient safety. It allows staff to share similar expecta-\ntions about what is to be communicated and how the commu-\nnication is structured. SBAR can be used face to face, over the\ntelephone or even in some written communication.\nUsing situation, background, assessment,\nrecommendation\nFirst, collect the information you need to pass on, and think\nthrough what you want to achieve by the communication, for\nexample, informing a colleague, asking for immediate help or\nrequesting advice. Consider some brief notes under the SBAR\nheadings.\nAttract the attention of the person you are communicating with.\nIntroduce yourself. If face to face, make eye contact. If possible, use\nthe person \u2019s name: \u2018H e l l o ,D rJ o n e s .M yn a m ei sD rS m i t h .I \u2019mo n e\nof the junior doctors in the emergency department. \u2019\n\u0081Situation: give a one- or two-sentence description covering\nwhy you are calling, what is happening and what the acute\nchange is.Communicating with colleagues \u0081419\n20"

            "Text": "The previous chapters have covered the idealised process of\ntaking a history and examining each system in depth. This\nchapter considers how this \u2018toolbox \u2019of skills can be used\nselectively and adaptively to address the patient \u2019s needs in\nspeci \ufb01c circumstances.\nAdapting to different presentations\nPresentation in emergency\nPatients presenting with collapse or multiple injury may clearly be\nunable to engage in the normal systematic process of history\ntaking and examination. The approach to the acutely ill or\ndeteriorating patient is covered in depth in Chapter 18 , but this\nclinical context demands a different approach:\n\u0081Triage of airway, breathing and circulation for immediate\nstabilisation\n\u0081Identifying the key elements of the history from a third party\n(witness, family) \u2013including the patient \u2019s normal level of\nfunctioning, the time course of the illness, major prior illnesses\nand any key precipitating events (e.g. medication taken, injury\nsustained).\n\u0081Interleaving further selected elements of examination with\ncritical investigations (e.g. chest x-ray, ultrasound) and\nresuscitation treatments such as establishing intravenous\naccess and administering \ufb02uids and/or emergency drug\ntreatment.\nSeamlessly merging these elements of assessment, triage and\ntreatment is a skill which becomes highly developed in Emer-\ngency Department clinicians but should be practiced by all, as\nthe sudden need to assist a collapsed or injured patient is\nsomething with which any clinician may be faced unexpectedly\n(see below).\nPresentation with localised illness\nSome patients present with a well-de \ufb01ned clinical problem in a\nspeci \ufb01c system, for example, an infected insect bite or a localised\nbony injury. In this situation, the temptation may be to con \ufb01ne\nhistory and examination to the affected incident and area.\nHowever, despite the resulting saving of time, this may not serve\nthe patient well. Although a comprehensive history and exami-\nnation may not be appropriate or even possible in this situation,\nnevertheless, some broader questioning is nearly always\nrequired. For example, an infection may indirectly reveal previ-\nously undiagnosed diabetes, so a brief enquiry about recent\nweight loss, polyuria and polydipsia may be helpful. Similarly, the\ninjured patient should always be asked about the context of the\ninjury in case there are underlying episodes of syncope or\nseizure, or a background of alcohol excess, which also need to\nbe addressed. Consider also the impact of the illness in the\ncontext of the patient \u2019s life. For example, a hand injury may\ndirectly threaten the livelihood of a manual labourer, sports\nprofessional or musician, and may compromise the ability of frail\nor isolated patients to maintain their self-care.Presentation with non-speci \ufb01c symptoms\nWhile many patients volunteer distinctive symptoms suggesting\nparticular disease processes, others offer less speci \ufb01c or more\nunusual clues and require a more broad-ranging approach.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for this:\n\u0081The patient \ufb01nds it hard to express what they are feeling in\nterms understandable to the clinician.\n\u0081They are actually suffering from more than one ailment at a\ntime (multimorbidity); this is increasingly common in elderly or\nfrail patients.\n\u0081Their disease is rare and the symptoms are genuine but\nunfamiliar to the doctor.\n\u0081Their disease process has begun to affect their health insid-\niously and generally (e.g. chronic poisoning, de \ufb01ciency states,\nhaematological malignancies or insidious autoimmune dis-\neases such as Addison \u2019s disease or pernicious anaemia).\nIn a further group of patients, a wide range of seemingly un-\nrelated symptoms are reported but no abnormality is found on\nexamination or investigation. These patients are not uncommon,\nparticularly in primary care, and this presentation is covered on\npage 417 (see Chapter 20 ).\nThese are the situations where a structured approach to the\nintegrated general examination ( Box 21.1 ) can be most useful.\nStudents taught in a system-based approach may initially \ufb01nd\nthis dif \ufb01cult, however with practice an integrated examination\nbecomes a quick and ef \ufb01cient tool for excluding serious\n21.1 One system for performing an integrated physical\nexamination\nGreeting and\nintroductionClearly identify yourself and establish a rapport\nObservation of\nwhole patientDemeanour, gait, ease of movement, speech, eye\ncontact, obesity/cachexia, plethora/pallor, \u2019spot\ndiagnosis \u2019signs\nHands Pallor, cyanosis, clubbing, wasting, palmar\nerythema, joint deformity, radial pulse\nFace Symmetry, complexion, spot diagnoses\n(e.g. myotonic dystrophy)\nMouth Central cyanosis, tongue fasciculation or wasting,\noropharynx\nNeck Lymphadenopathy, goitre, tracheaThorax Scars, respiratory rate/movements, heart, lungs,\nbreasts, axillae\nAbdomen Tenderness/guarding, liver, spleen, kidneys,\nmasses, aorta, hernial ori \ufb01ces, (\u00feif needed, with\nconsent, genitalia/PR)\nLower limbs Oedema, circulation, mobility, joints, neurologyUpper limbs Mobility, joints, neurology, blood pressureCranial nerves Including eye movements, visual \ufb01elds and\nfundoscopy\nBedside testing Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, height,\nweight, urinalysis424 \u0081ADAPTING SKILLS FOR PRACTICE"

It is important here to\nrecognise the limitations of what is possible and to focus on what\nthe patient needs \u2013if they cannot be assessed adequately at\nhome, day hospital attendance or outpatient investigations can\nbe arranged to ensure that the correct diagnosis is reached for\nthe patient.\nIn remote and rural settings, a local primary care or community\nhealthcare setting may be available, which offers better space,\nprivacy and access to examination equipment and near-patient\ntesting. However, complex illness is equally common in remote\nsettings and it is important for the local clinician to be able to\nrecognise when travel to a hospital for investigations such as\nimaging or endoscopy is required, despite the inconvenience\ninvolved.\nThe constraints on usual practice are particularly acute for\nclinicians who \ufb01nd themselves attending to unexpected emer-\ngencies outside of their workplace in the community ( \u2018Good\nSamaritan \u2019work), yet important and life-saving assessment and\ncare can still be performed pending the arrival of emergency\nservices. In this situation, the ethical obligation to treat the patient\nin need is foremost. However clinicians should, where possible,\nobtain patient consent, keep a written record of events and\nrecognise the limits of their competence while doing their best forthe patient until emergency help arrives.\nSituations vary widely; common scenarios include accidental\ninjury, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation following cardiac or res-\npiratory arrest, seizures and syncope. Early intervention from a\nbystander can be crucial. Even the simple act of placing an un-\nconscious patient in the recovery position (having \ufb01rst consid-\nered an unstable neck injury) may prevent a devastating\naspiration pneumonia. Maintenance of the airway, control of\nbleeding by pressure and assessment and recording of\nconscious level (GCS p. 398) are other examples of vital imme-\ndiate intervention. Collecting basic information about the cir-\ncumstances and initial clinical observations can be invaluable\nlater to the emergency team. In some societies, the fear of liti-\ngation can discourage those offering emergency help, but the\nneeds of the patient should always come \ufb01rst, as courts will\ngenerally strive to support the well-intentioned efforts of a trained\nindividual offering \ufb01rst aid in an emergency. Many medicalindemnity organisations offer cover for such \u2018Good Samaritan \u2019\nwork. In some countries, the law speci \ufb01cally protects clinicians\nwho assist patients in emergencies (e.g. the Social Action, Re-\nsponsibility and Heroism Act (2015) in England).\nRemote consultation\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted both the value and thelimitations of remote consultation by telephone or video link.\nWhilst it offers the patient signi \ufb01cant bene \ufb01t in terms of reduced\ntravel time, remote consultation is not appropriate for all situa-\ntions. Advance consideration of a number of factors should be\nused to select whether remote consultation is appropriate in\nparticular circumstances ( Box 21.2 ).\nTelephone consultation\nClinical consultations by telephone are particularly challenging for\nboth patients and clinicians because they remove the rich source\nof information normally available to both from non-verbal cues.\nThis loss is very dif \ufb01cult to mitigate, and the limitations of tele-\nphone consultation should be recognised explicitly. First check\nthat the patient is happy to communicate by phone, that thetiming is convenient and, if necessary, allow them time to \ufb01nd a\nprivate space where they are unlikely to be overheard. Clinicians,\non the telephone, should always allow the patient extra time to\nvolunteer concerns, taking care not to dominate the interaction\n21.2 Factors that determine whether remote\nconsultation may be appropriate\nFactor Favours remote Favours face to face\nPatient Willing/eager for remote\ncontactMobility problemsUnwilling to engage with\nremote contactHearing or speechimpairmentLanguage barrierLearning or cognitivedif\ufb01culty\nUnable to consent\nClinician Already knows patient\nMedical records availableNew to patient\nNo medical recordsavailable\nClinical\nproblemFollow-up of known\nconditionNew problem for\ndiagnosis\nPatient\nenvironmentPrivate space available\nLives far from hospitalNo privacy possible\nEquipment Telephone, computer or\ntablet\u00fesoftware available\nTechnically skilledLacks computer or mobile\ndeviceLacks digital skills\nSpecialty Relies more on history or\nresults of investigations(e.g. nephrology,gastroenterology)Relies more on physical\nexamination(e.g. otolaryngology,dermatology,orthopaedics)Adapting to different working environments \u0081425\n21"

The telephone should not be used routinely to\ncommunicate bad news or sensitive results, as there is limited\nopportunity to gauge non-verbal reaction or to offer additional\nsupport.\nVideo consultation\nVideo consultation adds back some, but not all, of the non-verbal\ncommunication at the cost of requiring the patient to have and\nengage with adequate technology for a successful call. This may\nlimit the applicability of video consultation to vulnerable patientswith physical or mental frailty or deprived circumstances,\npotentially exaggerating health inequalities. Again, it is vital to give\nthe patient time to express their concerns adequately and to\ncross-check that you have understood these concerns correctly\nduring the video consultation.\nExamination and investigation\nEven video consultation clearly removes the capacity to un-\ndertake physical examination apart from the purely observa-\ntional aspects (joint deformity, skin lesions etc.). Simple tests\nsuch as observing the patient touching their toes or getting up\nfrom a chair and crossing the room ( \u2018get up and go test \u2019(p.\n387)) may be possible to perform with patience and a coop-\nerative patient but are at the limit of what is reasonably possible\nfor most patients. One possible hybrid solution is for the patient\nto be accompanied on the remote call by a local clinician who\ncan perform simple tests and examination on behalf of the\nspecialist. However, this approach has not yet been widely\nvalidated.\nEmailed photographs are used increasingly for dermatological\nconsultations but require an adequate camera and lighting as\nwell as skill and motivation on the part of the patient to provide\nimages of suf \ufb01cient quality from several angles, including stan-\ndard objects to reveal scale. To prevent health inequality, it is\nimportant to recognise when such efforts fall short and to\narrange for conventional face-to-face interaction to ensure good\nquality care.Portable devices which allow patients to make remote ob-\nservations (which, if automatically transmitted to a receiving unit,\nis referred to as telemetry), can allow useful information to be\ngathered remotely in speci \ufb01c situations. In particular, home\nmonitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation\nand spirometry is now used widely in speci \ufb01c patient groups.\nThere is emerging evidence that some conditions such as dia-\nbetes and chronic heart failure can be monitored remotely withregular home recording of clinical measurements such as weight,\nblood pressure and blood glucose. However, this practice is\nrelatively new and the risk of missing important \ufb01ndings such as\nnew onset atrial \ufb01brillation or retinopathy remains to be assessed.\nCommunicating with patients by message\nAsynchronous communication with patients using email or web-\nbased applications has been adopted by some clinicians. These\ninteractions are most commonly administrative but may also\ninclude online consultation and online triage of problems for\nonward referral. However, this is not yet widely seen as a viable\nalternative to face-to-face consultation or synchronous remote\nconsultation, and concerns remain about the security of con \ufb01-\ndential information transmitted in this way.\nWhile the convenience of remote consultation is popular with\nsome groups of patients, it remains very important to meet pa-\ntients directly at regular intervals because even the best quality\nremote assessments are rarely a complete substitute for con-\nventional face-to-face clinical assessment.\nAdapting clinical skills over a career\nThe skills described in this book are best regarded as a \u2018toolbox \u2019\nwhich different clinicians will draw on differently as their careers\ndiverge. With increasing clinical expertise, this solid foundation\ncan be adapted for use in many different clinical and community\nsettings. The progressive emergence of remote consultation is\none example of how the environment in which medicine is\npracticed evolves over time and in \ufb02uences the selective use of\nskills.

            "Text": "General principles\nClinical assessments are integral to undergraduate and post-\ngraduate medical education and training, and are designed to\nverify that those involved in the care of patients meet safe clinical\nstandards. Assessments can be formative and/or summative.\nFormative assessments (such as workplace-based assessments\nand progress tests) allow you to receive feedback on and\nmonitor your own performance. Assessments such as these\ncan be highly effective adjuncts to learning if they promote\nre\ufb02ection on your own performance and recognition of areas for\nimprovement and further development. Summative assess-\nments, on the other hand, are used to evaluate whether you have\nachieved a required competence or standard of pro \ufb01ciency in\nterms of knowledge, skills or performance, which may be set bylicensing bodies such as the General Medical Council in the UK\nor postgraduate colleges. Assessments can also be used to\nprovide evidence of safe practice: for example, simulation as-\nsessments for doctors in dif \ufb01culty, or for recruitment and selec-\ntion into specialty training.\nThis chapter provides an overview of the spectrum of clinical\nassessment methods, with a particular emphasis on objective\nstructured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and clinical simulation\nscenarios. Guidance is offered on how to prepare for formal\nassessment, including the role of deliberate rehearsal, along with\nsuggestions for optimising your performance in clinical and\ncommunication skills assessment.\nMethods of assessment\nThe most widely used clinical assessment methods includeOSCEs, short cases, long cases and clinical simulation scenarios\n(Box 22.1 ), during which you may be observed performing an\nintegrated sequence of clinical, practical and/or communication\nskills.\nDifferent assessment formats test different aspects of your\nprofessional competence or expertise. Short cases, for example,\nwill usually focus on testing either your clinical examination skills\nor your ability to take a history from a patient. Modern assess-\nment methods, such as OSCEs and clinical simulation, allow\nassessment of knowledge, skills and professional behaviours in\nan integrated manner and can permit candidates to demonstrate\na higher level of performance through \u2018showing how \u2019and \u2018doing \u2019\n(Fig 22.1 ). Increasingly, assessment of communication skills is\nbeing undertaken remotely. In this situation, the focus of the\nassessment is likely to be on taking a history, or giving expla-\nnation and/or advice to a patient or surrogate in a community\nsetting. Make sure that your remote environment is suitable for\nthe assessment, with adequate technology and lighting, and be\naware that you may lose some of the non-verbal cues that\nyou might ordinarily rely on during an in-person consultation(see p. 4 for guidance on remote consultations).\nAssessments are linked to the learning outcomes of a course\nor curriculum, and \u2018blueprinting \u2019is used to ensure that there is\nappropriate coverage of the required knowledge, skills andbehaviours across the examination. To perform well in clinical\nassessments, it is therefore crucial that you familiarise yourself\nwith both the curriculum and the domains or skills on which you\nare being assessed. Not all skills will be assessed at each ex-\namination ( Box 22.2 ).\nOnce you have achieved a standard of competence in a\nclinical skill or domain, you may be considered \u2018entrustable \u2019in\nthis professional activity. For example, a \ufb01nal-year medical stu-\ndent may be \u2018entrusted \u2019to perform peripheral cannulation on a\npatient if they have demonstrated competence in the speci \ufb01ed\ndomains (such as obtaining consent from a patient for the pro-\ncedure and technical competence in the procedure itself).\nClinical simulation\nClinical simulation, using either high- \ufb01delity patient mannequins\nor simulated patients, is increasingly employed for teaching andlearning in healthcare, as it supports deliberate rehearsal of\nclinical skills in a realistic setting without compromising patient\nsafety. Experiential learning such as this ( \u2018learning by doing \u2019) also\nsupports the transition from theory to practice. Clinical simulation\nis commonly included in both undergraduate and postgraduate\nassessments to evaluate a candidate \u2019s ability to integrate a\nnumber of complex skills or domains, which may include clinical\nexamination, practical skills and drug or \ufb02uid prescribing. Often\nthe scenario will involve an acutely unwell patient who is expe-\nriencing a medical emergency such as life-threatening asthma,\nwhere the use of a real patient is not feasible ( Box 22.3 ). The\npatient mannequin is set up in a realistic clinical environment\n(such as a simulated ward), with real props and equipment (such\nas a nebuliser mask), and there is often an additional member of\nstaff in the room (playing the role of the nurse, for example) who\ncan perform tasks and provide results of investigations if\nrequested by the candidate. Sometimes a facilitator may also be\nthe \u2018voice \u2019of the patient, giving important prompts ( \u2018I can \u2019t\nbreathe \u2019or simulating an audible wheeze). The candidate in-\nstructions will clarify what is expected of you, but it is likely that\nyou will be assessed on your competence in physical assess-\nment, communication skills and the initial management of the\npatient.\nOSCEs\nThese are widely used in undergraduate and postgraduate as-sessments and are commonly designed to assess communi-\ncation/consultation skills, practical skills, examination skills or an\nintegrated combination of all of these. OSCEs consist of multiple\nclinical encounters or \u2018stations \u2019(generally between 6 and 12).\nCandidates rotate through each station, which will be assigned a\n\ufb01xed duration (usually 8 to 12 minutes).\nOSCEs may use a combination of real patients with good\nclinical signs, simulated patients who often participate in the\ncommunication skills stations, simulation mannequins (who may\nbe put in the role of an acutely unwell patient where using a real\npatient is not feasible or safe) and/or part-task trainers (lifelike\nmodels of body parts) for assessment of procedural skills such\nas venepuncture ( Box 22.4 ).428 \u0081PREPARING FOR ASSESSMENT"

            "Text": "Marking structures\nExaminers award marks for your performance in assessments\nusing a standardised marking structure. While this varies from\none type of examination to another, some common marking\napproaches are used, and you should be familiar with these.\nMany assessments will employ a \u2018checklist \u2019format that allows\nthe examiners to award your score objectively. These checklistsare commonly used in OSCE stations, where the assessment is\nbroken down into its individual components (e.g. \u2018Introduces self to\npatient \u2019), each component is allocated a range of marks, and your\nscore is calculated as the sum of the component marks (see\nBox 22.4 ). Often a signi \ufb01cant number of marks will be allocated to\ngeneric aspects of the encounter (such as hand washing,\nobtaining consent to proceed, and demonstrating kindness and\nrespect). There may also be some elements of the OSCE that aremandatory to achieve a pass (such as administering oxygen to a\nsimulated patient with acute asthma or addressing the patient \u2019s\nconcerns in a communications station). By familiarising yourself\nwith the marking structure for the examination, you can ensure that\nyou tailor your preparation to maximise your chance of success.\nAnother common examination marking approach is the use of\ndomain-based marking. Marks are awarded as a rating of per-\nformance or competence in particular domains or distinct\nobserved behaviours (such as \u2018Identifying clinical signs \u2019or\n\u2018Maintaining patient welfare \u2019, see Box 22.3 ). Where domain-\nbased marking is used, make sure you know what domains\nare being assessed. Examiners will usually also be asked to\nmake a global judgement of the candidate \u2019s performance overall\non the station. This is used to determine the pass score for each\nstation. If the assessment has included a simulated or real pa-\ntient, they may also be asked for their global judgement of your\nperformance.\nIn the majority of clinical examinations, the purpose of\nassessment is to distinguish candidates who are competent, and\nthose who are not yet competent for their stage of training. Ex-\naminers undergo detailed and speci \ufb01c training before partici-\npating in assessments, and they participate in calibration of\nexamination scenarios to establish what performance would be\ndeemed \u2018not yet competent \u2019in each of the domains.\nApproach to preparation\nMake sure that you start to prepare well in advance and famil-\niarise yourself with the format of the assessment: know how\nmany stations there are, how long you have for each station and\nwhat domains or skills are being assessed. Most institutions will\nreadily help you understand what standard is expected from a\ncandidate to pass each station, and there may be useful infor-\nmation available online. For example, to achieve a pass in a\nphysical examination OSCE you may be required to perform a\nsystematic examination, correctly identify the physical signs,\ncreate a sensible differential diagnosis and suggest an appro-\npriate initial management plan. Remember that assessments are\n\u2018blueprinted \u2019(that is, they will be mapped to the learning out-\ncomes from your curriculum; Box 22.2 ) and you should therefore\nuse the curriculum to guide your learning.\nTo some extent, the cases you are likely to be presented with\nin an examination can be predicted. Institutions will typically have\na cohort of volunteer patients with common chronic stable dis-\neases (such as pulmonary \ufb01brosis or a renal transplant) or\npathognomonic signs (retinitis pigmentosa or acromegaly) who\nhave volunteered to participate. These patients may have helped\nin examinations before and will be well prepared to cooperate22.3 Clinical simulation station\nLife-threatening asthma.\nYou are a junior doctor on the admissions unit.

Deliberate practice, repeating the skills and\nsequences of examination that you will be expected to execute\non the day, helps to make these behaviours automatic and re-\nduces the chances of you forgetting an aspect of history taking\nor physical examination under pressure.\nApproach to assessment\nProfessionalism\nMake sure that you are smartly dressed, look professional andadhere to any local infection control and uniform policies. Most\ninstitutions would expect you to be bare from the elbows down\nand to have long hair tied back. Ensure that you have the\nappropriate clinical equipment with you (such as stethoscope,\npen torch and so on) and are familiar with their use. If you are\ngoing to have physical contact with a patient during the\nassessment, always clean your hands with alcohol-based gel or\nsoap and water (Fig. 3.1) and observe basic safety principles,\nincluding the use of personal protective equipment and safe\nsharps disposal.\nManaging time\nManaging your time, both in advance of and during theassessment, can have a major impact on your performance.\nMake sure that you know where the examination is to be held,rehearse your journey to the venue and give yourself plenty of\ntime to get there. If the examination is remote, make sure that\nyou have the necessary internet browser and version, and where\npossible, that others are not using your Wi-Fi connection at the\nsame time as your exam.\nPay particular attention to the timings within the examination\nand ensure that you have practised completing your assess-\nment within the allocated time. Some assessments will bebroken into different stages, and it is worth \ufb01nding out as much\nas you can about the format; you may think you have 10 mi-\nnutes to complete the OSCE station but in reality you may be\nallowed to spend only part of the time with the patient, with the\nremaining time reserved for questioning from the examiners.\nMarks will be awarded for your answers to these questions. If\nyou take too long assessing the patient, you may not be able\nto take advantage of these marks. Assessments will often have\nshort breaks between stations to allow candidates to read the\ninstructions for the next station; once again, it is helpful to\nfamiliarise yourself with these aspects of the examination in\nadvance to reduce any uncertainty. However, be reassured\nthat the staff at the assessment will be monitoring the timings\nof the examination and will lead you smoothly through the\nstations.\nCommunication during assessment\nIt is vital in any assessment that you communicate with the ex-aminers and patients in a polite and professional manner, as you\nwould in real clinical practice. Always obtain consent from the\npatient to be examined, be sure not to cause any physical\ndiscomfort and thank them at the end of the station. Examiners\nwill be assessing your communication skills and bedside manner,\nas well as your clinical examination technique.\nListen carefully to the instructions from the examiners, as these\nare often very speci \ufb01c( \u2018Examine this patient \u2019s precordium \u2019). You\nmay also be told whether you should present your \ufb01ndings as\nyou go along or at the end of your examination. Pause for a\nmoment once you have \ufb01nished your physical examination to\nconsider whether your \ufb01ndings make sense, and ready yourself\nto present them in an organised and logical manner. When\npresenting your clinical \ufb01ndings, try to sound con \ufb01dent about\nthem, avoid using language that indicates uncertainty in your\nown abilities and never report \ufb01ndings that you have not actually\nelicited. Use a succinct and structured format when presenting,\nhighlighting important positive \ufb01ndings and describing only the\nrelevant negative \ufb01ndings ( Box 22.5 ); listing all negatives wastes\nvaluable time. If there is an obvious abnormality (such as a pa-\ntient who is jaundiced), it is sensible to mention this early in your\ncase presentation so that examiners see that you have noted the\nimportant \ufb01nding. Do not expect any feedback from your ex-\naminers at the end of each station, as they are generally asked to\navoid giving you an indication of how you have performed.\nIn communication stations involving simulated patients, you\nmay be asked to take a focused history, to discuss a speci \ufb01c\nissue such as consent or to break some dif \ufb01cult news. The\nsimulated patients will have been given a standardised scenario\nor brief that often includes information that they will volunteer to432 \u0081PREPARING FOR ASSESSMENT"

It is therefore important to ensure that you take a\nstructured approach to your questioning, making sure that you\nstart with open questions and listen carefully to the information\nthe patient is sharing. You should then focus on pertinentaspects of the history using more direct questioning. It is\nimportant to enquire about the patient \u2019s own concerns. It can be\nhelpful to summarise the information back to the patient towards\nthe end of the consultation, as this allows you to distill the key\npoints in your own mind and gives the patient an opportunity to\nadd any information that you may have missed.\nManaging unexpected dif \ufb01culties\nEven with thorough preparation, things may not go to plan,\nbecause of examination pressure or nerves, or by misunder-\nstanding the format of a station or the question you are asked.\nRemember that examiners generally want you to succeed and\nwill have experienced similar assessments themselves. They will\nunderstand that you may be very nervous and will try to support\nyou if you are \ufb01nding the experience dif \ufb01cult. If you feel you have\nperformed poorly in a station, try to put it behind you and focusyour attention on the next one, where you may be able to recover\nyour position. Remember that in most assessments your \ufb01nal\nmark will be a composite of all of the components of the\nassessment, and it is often possible to fail a station or two and\nstill pass overall.\nPutting it all together\nPreparing for assessment starts long before the examination\nitself. Deliberate repeated practice of clinical and communica-\ntion skills is key to performing well on the day. This should\ninclude timed practice within the format itself, as well as prac-\ntice in presenting your \ufb01ndings to a surrogate examiner. A\ndetailed understanding of the examination format and timing, as\nwell as the marking structure, will help to ensure that you are\nwell prepared.\nTake time to review the information provided in the relevant\nsystem-based chapters, as well as the more general guidance in\nSection 1, and watch the clinical videos for examples of\ncomprehensive systematic examination techniques.\nGood luck!22.5 Presenting your \ufb01ndings: examination of the\ncardiovascular system\n\u2018Mr. Scott is a 65-year-old male. On general inspection, the patient looks\ncomfortable at rest and has a normal respiratory rate. Examination of thehands does not show any abnormality such as splinter haemorrhages. The\npulse is regular and is slow rising in character with a rate of 80 beats/min;\nthere is no evidence of a collapsing pulse. The JVP is not elevated; I didnot detect any central cyanosis. Examination of the precordium revealedno evidence of scars; the apex beat is palpable in the \ufb01fth intercostal\nspace and there are no thrills or heaves. On auscultation, the heart\nsounds are normal and there is a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur,loudest over the aortic area and radiating to the carotids. To conclude myexamination, I would like to measure the blood pressure, listen to the lung\nbases, check for peripheral oedema and assess peripheral pulses. The\nmost likely diagnosis in this patient is that of aortic stenosis \u2019.Putting it all together \u0081433\n22"
