            "Text": "We are pleased to present the Second South Asian Edition (SAE) of Bates\u2019 \nPocket Guide to Physical Examination and History Taking . This edition has \nbeen adapted from Bates\u2019 Pocket Guide to Physical Examination and His -\ntory Taking , 9th edition and first SAE. Despite the remarkable advance -\nments in diagnostic techniques, history taking and clinical examination \nremain irreplaceable. One of the challenges faced by medical students is \ntheir hesitation in communicating with patients, often due to the lack of \nknowledge in dealing with the patients. This book aims to empower the \nstudents by providing them with the required knowledge to take patient \nhistory and conduct focused examinations. \nIn comparison to the previous edition, this edition has been updated to \nenhance the learning experience for readers. It includes vivid illustrations, \ndetailed descriptions, important tables and boxes, and relevant radiologi -\ncal images to enrich the readers with information applicable to their clini -\ncal practice. Another highlight of this edition is the introduction of clinical \ndiagnostic algorithms for common signs and symptoms. These algorithms \nare provided to facilitate thinking through tiers of considerations in clin -\nical decision-making. These are not presented as definitive but rather as \nexamples of the types of decision-making students might want to consider. \nThe algorithms presented in this book are intended for use as diagnostic \nlearning guides and not as the sole drivers of diagnostic and management \nprotocols for individual patients.\nSpecial attention has been given to certain topics such as latent tuberculo -\nsis, leprosy, rheumatic heart disease and its complications, obesity, meta -\nbolic disorders, mental health, adult immunization, as well as socioepide -\nmiological factors and their influence on health in the South Asian region.\nAn attempt has been made to update the national and international guide -\nlines and recommendations for diagnosis and treatment wherever possible \nas staying abreast with the ever-expanding knowledge database is in itself \na herculean task in the field of medicine.\nThis book provides a concise peek into the art of clinical medicine. Its \ncompact size makes it easy to carry at the bedside, serving as a valuable \nresource for students. We feel privileged to have had the opportunity to \ncontribute to this edition and hope the readers enjoy reading the book as \nmuch as we did while editing it.\nNeeraj Nischal\nSwati Gupta\nKaran MadanPreface\nBates.indb   7Bates.indb   7 30-06-2023   11:44:0630-06-2023   11:44:06"

Through -\nout this sequence, you must always stay attuned to the patient\u2019s feelings, \nhelp the patient express them, respond to their content, and validate their \nsignificance.\nStage 1: Initiating the Encounter\n nSet the stage and prepare for the interview.  Check your appearance. \nMake sure the patient is comfortable and the environment is conducive \nto the personal information soon to be shared.\n nAdjust the environment.  Always consider the patient\u2019s privacy. Pull \nshut any bedside curtains. Suggest moving to an empty room rather \nthan having a conversation that can be overheard. Choose a distance \nthat facilitates conversation and allows good eye contact.\n nSet your agenda.  Clarify your goals for the interview. A clinician \nmust balance provider-centered goals with patient-centered goals . The \nclinician\u2019s task is to balance these multiple agendas.\n nGreet the patient. Greet the patient  by name and introduce yourself, \ngiving your name. If possible, shake hands (always keep in mind the \ncultural beliefs of the patient). If this is the first contact, explain your \nrole, including your status as a student and how you will be involved \nin the patient\u2019s care. As much as possible, let patients  dictate how they \nwould like to be addressed.\n nClinicians should ask all patients their preferred name and gender \npronouns.  Avoid first names unless you have specific permission from \nthe patient.\n nWhen asking patients about their pronouns, it can be helpful to \nshare your own pronouns with patients, asking: \u201cWhich gender pro -\nnouns do you use?\u201d For example, \u201cI use . . . he and him/she and \nhers/they and theirs.\u201d\n nEstablish initial rapport (Box 1-1).  Several measures to establish ini -\ntial rapport include:\n nMaintain confidentiality.  Let the patient decide if visitors or family \nmembers should remain in the room and ask for the patient\u2019s per -\nmission before conducting the interview in front of them.\n nAttend to the patient\u2019s comfort.  Ask how he or she is feeling and if you \nare coming at a convenient time. Look for signs of discomfort, such \nas frequent changes of position or facial expressions that show pain or \nanxiety. Arranging the bed may make the patient more comfortable.\n nArrange the environment.  Choose a distance that facilitates conver -\nsation and good eye contact. Try to sit at eye level with the patient. \nBates.indb   2Bates.indb   2 30-06-2023   11:44:0930-06-2023   11:44:09"

It is important to identify both your own \nand the patient\u2019s issues at the beginning of the encounter. Often, \nyou may need to focus the interview by asking the patient which \nproblem is most pressing. For example, \u201cDo you have some special \nconcerns today? Which one are you most concerned about?\u201d Some \npatients may not have a specific complaint or problem. It is still \nimportant to start with the patient\u2019s story.\n nInviting the patient to tell story.  Encourage patients to tell their own \nstories, using their own words. Begin with open-ended questions  \nthat allow full freedom of response: \u201cTell me more about\u2026\u201d Avoid \nquestions that restrict the patient to a minimally informative \u201cyes\u201d \nor \u201cno\u201d answer. Listen to the patient\u2019s answers without interrupting.\n nFollowing the patient\u2019s leads.  Use verbal and nonverbal cues that \nprompt patients to recount their stories spontaneously. Use continu -\ners, especially at the outset, such as nodding your head and using \nphrases such as \u201cUh huh,\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d and \u201cI see.\u201d\n nExplore the patient\u2019s perspective of illness.  Disease  is the explanation that \nthe clinician  uses to organize symptoms that lead to a clinical diagnosis. \nIllness  is a construct that explains how the patient experiences the disease, \nincluding its effects on relationships, function, and sense of well-being. The \ninterview needs to include both of these views of reality.  Learning how \npatients perceive illness means asking patient-centered questions in the four \ndomains listed below, which follow the mnemonic \u201cFIFE\u201d (Box 1-4).\nBOX 1-4.

There are several clinical skills that can mitigate the impact of bias \nin clinical encounters (Box 1-6).\nBOX 1-6.  Skills and Practices to Mitigate Bias in Y our \nClinical Encounters\nReflect on \npatterns of \nemotion and \nbehaviorPay attention to how you feel and how you behave \naround patients of different identities. The patterns you \nbegin to recognize may reflect biases that can impact \nyour interactions with patients, as well as your clinical \nreasoning. Becoming aware of these biases is the first \nstep in reducing their impact on patient care. \nPause before start -\ning an encounter \nand prepare for \npotential triggers \nof biasOnce you are aware of your potential biases, pay \nattention to situations that may trigger them. Simply \nbeing aware of a bias might help minimize its effect. You \nmay take deliberate actions to reduce the impact of \nyour biases. \nGenerate \nalternative \nhypotheses for \nbiases anchored \nin behaviorMany biases are anchored in clinician assumptions about \npatient behavior (nonadherence, substance use, etc.). \nMake it a habit to consider what structural forces (socio -\neconomic status, race/racism, homophobia, etc.) impact \npatient behaviors, and how these alternative hypotheses \ncan challenge assumptions you make about patients. \nPractice universal \ncommunication \nand interpersonal \nskillsOften clinicians will not recognize when a bias is at play in \na clinical encounter. Universal communication and \ninterpersonal skills can serve to reduce the impact of \nunconscious biases on the way you interact with patients.\nExplore your \npatients\u2019 identitiesMany biases are anchored in clinician assumptions around \npatient identities. By simply asking patients to clarify what \ntheir identities mean to them, clinicians can dismantle \ntheir assumptions and better understand their patients. \nExplore your \npatients\u2019 \nexperiences of \nbiasClinical encounters are influenced by patients\u2019 prior experi -\nences of implicit and explicit bias in health care. Exploring \nthese experiences can help you partner with your patients \nand better understand their approach to health care. \nBates.indb   10Bates.indb   10 30-06-2023   11:44:0930-06-2023   11:44:09"

As you leave, clean your equip -\nment, dispose of waste materials, and wash your hands.\nObserving Standard and MRSA Precautions.  Observe standard and \nuniversal precautions. Use rigorous handwashing before and after all \npatient contact and, whenever indicated, personal protective equipment \n(gloves; gowns; and mouth, nose, and eye protection); safe injection prac -\ntices; safe handling of contaminated equipment or surfaces; respiratory \nhygiene and cough etiquette; patient isolation criteria; and precautions \nrelating to equipment, toys, solid surfaces, and laundry handling.\nObserving Universal Precautions. Universal precautions are a set of pre -\ncautions designed to prevent transmission of HIV, HBV, and other blood -\nborne pathogens when providing first aid or health care. The following \nfluids are considered potentially infectious: all blood and other body fluids \ncontaining visible blood, semen, and vaginal secretions; and cerebrospinal, \nsynovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic fluids.  Protective \nbarriers include gloves, gowns, aprons, masks, face shields, and protective \neyewear. All healthcare workers should observe the important precautions \nfor safe injections and prevention of injury from needlesticks, scalpels, and \nother sharp instruments and devices (Box 4-3). Report to your health \nservice immediately, if such injuries occur.\nBates.indb   52Bates.indb   52 30-06-2023   11:44:1230-06-2023   11:44:12"

A helpful approach is to \ntease out separate clusters of observations and analyze one cluster at a time.\n nAnatomic Location.  Clustering your findings anatomically  could point \nto a potential source of the problem. Sometimes you may have to settle \nfor a body region or system.\n nAge: Younger patients are more likely to have a single disease compared \nto older patients.\n nTiming of symptoms.\n nInvolvement of different body systems : If symptoms and signs occur in \na single system, one disease may explain them. Problems in different, \napparently unrelated, systems often require more than one explanation.\n nMultisystem conditions:  With experience, you will become increasingly \nadept at recognizing multisystem conditions  and building plausible expla -\nnations that link manifestations that are seemingly unrelated. Related risk \nfactors should be explored promptly.\nSynthesize Clinical Information and Develop the \nProblem Representation\nAs you gather and organize clinical data during the patient encounter, \nyou simultaneously  synthesize this information to form a problem represen -\ntation \u2014your evolving sense of the clinical picture (Box 5-2). It usually \ncontains the patient\u2019s initial information (chief complaint, epidemiology, \nand risk factors), key features in the history and physical examination, and \nresults of diagnostic testing.

He says that he \nwas shoveling leaves from his garden when he suddenly developed \na moderately severe pain in the center of his chest right behind the \nsternum. The pain lasted for approximately 1 to 2 minutes and did \nnot move anywhere else. He said that the pain was accompanied \nby shortness of breath.

Another strategy for preventing HIV infections is pre-  \nexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves taking a daily pill containing \ntwo antiretroviral drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine).

The Fagan nomogram is a graphical way to show how \nthe likelihood ratios for a given test result can change the probability of \ndisease (Fig. 7-2). With this nomogram, you set the pretest probabilities \n(based on disease prevalence) on the vertical line on the left, then take a \nstraight edge and draw a line from the pretest probability through the \nlikelihood ratio in the middle line, and then read the posttest probability \non the vertical line on the right.\nFigure 7-2 shows how the Fagan nomogram displays probability revi -\nsions.

In this example, the diagnostic test has \na sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91%.

The Evidence-Based Working Group, which con -\nsists of experts in epidemiology, has created a rigorous and standardized \napproach for evaluating studies that has been applied to a wide range \nof clinical topics, including therapeutic and prevention trials, diagnostic \ntests, meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses, and practice guidelines. \nThis approach asks three basic questions:\n1. Are the results valid (can you believe them)?\n2. What are the results (magnitude and precision)?\n3. How can you apply the results to patient care?\nAre the Results Valid?\nWhen evaluating results of studies on treatment or a prevention interven -\ntion, it is important to have a thorough understanding of bias.

Use open-ended ques -\ntions to explore the attributes of the patient\u2019s fatigue and encourage the \npatient to fully describe what he or she is experiencing. See Algorithm 8-1, \nApproach to the patient with fatigue, p. 125.\nWeakness  differs from fatigue. It denotes a demonstrable loss of muscle \npower and will be discussed later with other neurologic symptoms.\nFever, Chills, and Night Sweats\nAsk about fever if the patient has an acute or chronic illness. Find out \nwhether the patient has used a  thermometer to  measure the tempera -\nture. Distinguish between feeling cold  and a shaking chill,  with shivering \nthroughout the body and chattering of teeth.

This is also the term used in the current Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ), the diagnostic manual \nused by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals in the United \nStates. However, there are inherent issues with this nomenclature and terms \nsuch as mental illness  or psychiatric illness  may be preferred. In fact, DSM-5  \nacknowledges that the term maybe misleading since it implies a distinc -\ntion between mental disorders and physical disorders but continues its use \nbecause there is no appropriate substitute as of the present time.\nClinicians are uniquely poised to detect clues to mental illness and harm -\nful behavior through empathic listening and close observation. Nonethe -\nless, these clues are often missed. Recognizing mental illness is especially \nimportant given its significant prevalence and morbidity, the high likeli -\nhood that it is treatable, the shortage of psychiatrists, and the increasing \nimportance of primary care clinicians as the first to encounter the patient\u2019s \ndistress. According to National Mental Health Survey 2015\u201316, every 6th \nIndian requires treatment for mental illness. Translating this into absolute \nnumbers, in a country of over 130 crores, it is a huge burden. \nMental health disorders are commonly masked by other clinical condi -\ntions. Look for the interaction of anxiety and depression in patients with \nsubstance abuse, termed \u201cdual diagnosis,\u201d because both must be treated \nfor the patient to achieve optimal function. Overall, 30% of symptoms are \nmedically unexplained, masking anxiety, depression, or even somatoform \ndisorders (see Table 9-1, Somatoform Disorders: Types and Approach to \nSymptoms, p. 145).

Add a strong light source if the room is dark. You will also need \na small ruler or tape measure and a small magnifying glass to help you doc -\nument important features of skin lesions, such as size, shape, color, and \ntexture. Dermoscopy  provides cross-polarized or unpolarized light to visu -\nalize patterns of pigmentation or vascular structures and improves the sen -\nsitivity and specificity of differentiating melanomas from benign lesions.\nAsk the patient to change into a gown with the opening in the back and \nclothes removed except for underwear. Before beginning the examina -\ntion, cleanse your hands thoroughly. It is important for you to palpate \nlesions for texture, firmness, and scaliness.\nImportant Terms for Describing Skin Lesions. It is important to use \nspecific terminology (Box 10-1). Good descriptions include each of the \nfollowing elements: type of primary lesion, number, size, shape, color, \ntexture, location, and configuration.\nBOX 10-1 . Describing Skin Findings\nPrimary lesions are flat or raised .\n nFlat: You cannot palpate the lesion with your eyes closed.\n nMacule:  Lesion is flat and <1 cm.\n nPatch:  Lesion is flat and >1 cm.\n nRaised : You can palpate the lesion with eyes closed.\n nPapule:  Lesion is raised, <1 cm, and not fluid-filled.\n nPlaque:  Lesion is raised, >1 cm, but not fluid-filled.\n nVesicle:  Lesion is raised, <1 cm, and filled with fluid.\n nBulla:  Lesion is raised, >1 cm, and fluid-filled.\n nOther primary lesions include erosions, ulcers, nodules, ecchymoses, \npetechiae, and palpable purpura.\nNumber: Lesions can be solitary or multiple. If multiple, record how \nmany. Also consider estimating the total number of the type of lesion \nyou are describing.\nSize: Measure with a ruler in millimeters or centimeters. For oval lesions, \nmeasure in the long axis then perpendicular to the axis.\nShape: Some good words to learn are \u201ccircular, \u201d \u201coval, \u201d \u201cannular\u201d (ring-like, \nwith central clearing), \u201cnummular\u201d (coin-like, no central clearing), and \n\u201cpolygonal. \u201d\nBates.indb   150Bates.indb   150 30-06-2023   11:44:2330-06-2023   11:44:23"

Increasing lifetime \nsun exposure correlates directly with increasing risk of skin cancer. Inter -\nmittent sun exposure appears to be more harmful than chronic exposure. \nThe best defense against skin cancers is to avoid ultraviolet radiation expo -\nsure by limiting time in the sun, avoiding midday sun, using sunscreen, \nand wearing sun-protective clothing with long sleeves and hats with wide \nbrims. Advise patients to avoid indoor tanning, especially children, teens, \nand young adults. Use of indoor tanning beds, especially before age 35 \nyears, increases risk of melanoma by as much as 75%. In 2009, the Inter -\nnational Agency for Research on Cancer classified ultraviolet-emitting \ntanning devices as \u201ccarcinogenic to humans.\u201d\nRegular Use of Sunscreen Prevents Skin Cancer. A landmark study in \n2011 demonstrated that the regular use of sunscreen decreases the inci -\ndence of melanoma. Advise patients to use at least sun-protective factor \n(SPF) 30 and broad-spectrum protection. For water exposure, patients \nshould use water-resistant sunscreens. The U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce (USPSTF) has issued a grade B recommendation supporting behav -\nioral counseling to minimize ultraviolet radiation exposure in fair-skinned \npersons aged 6 months to 24 years.\nSkin Cancer Screening\nAlthough the USPSTF found insufficient evidence (grade I) to recom -\nmend routine skin cancer screening, it does advise clinicians to \u201cremain \nalert for skin lesions with malignant features\u201d during routine physical \nexaminations and reference the ABCDE criteria. The American Can -\ncer Society (ACS) and the AAD recommend full-body examinations for \npatients over age 50 years or at high risk, because melanoma can appear in \nany location. High-risk patients are those with a personal or family history \nof multiple or dysplastic nevi or previous melanoma. Both new and chang -\ning nevi should be closely examined, as at least half of melanomas arise de \nnovo from isolated melanocytes rather than pre-existing nevi.\nScreening for Melanoma: ABCDEs.  Clinicians should apply the ABC -\nDE-EFG method when screening moles for melanoma (this does not \napply for nonmelanocytic lesions like seborrheic keratoses) (Box 10-4). \nThe sensitivity of this tool for detecting melanoma ranges from 43% to \n97%, and specificity from 36% to 100%; diagnostic accuracy depends on \nhow many criteria are used to define abnormality.\nBates.indb   160Bates.indb   160 30-06-2023   11:44:2830-06-2023   11:44:28"

Yet India \ncontinues to account for 60% of new cases globally per year.\nLeprosy has been divided under various classifications:\nWHO Classification (2018) is based on clinical and microbiological \nfeatures.

Switch on the ophthalmoscope light and turn the \nlens disc until you see the large round beam of white light. Shine the \nlight on the back of your hand to check the type of light, its desired \nbrightness, and the electrical charge of the ophthalmoscope.\n nTurn the focusing wheel to the 0 diopter. (A diopter  is a unit that \nmeasures the power of a lens to converge or diverge light.) At \nthis diopter, the lens neither converges nor diverges light. Keep \nyour finger on the edge of the lens disc so that you can turn the \nfocusing wheel to focus the lens when you examine the fundus.\n nHold the ophthalmoscope in your right hand and use your right \neye to examine the patient\u2019s right eye ; hold it in your left hand and \nuse your left eye to examine the patient\u2019s left eye . This keeps you \nfrom bumping the patient\u2019s nose and gives you more mobility \nand closer range for visualizing the fundus. With practice, you will \nbecome accustomed to using your nondominant eye.\n nHold the ophthalmoscope firmly braced against the medial \naspect of your bony orbit, with the handle tilted laterally at about \n20\u00b0 slant from the vertical. Check to make sure you can see clearly \nthrough the aperture. Instruct the patient to look slightly up and \nover your shoulder at a point directly ahead on the wall.\n nPlace yourself about 15 in away from the patient and at an angle \n15\u00b0 lateral to the patient\u2019s line of vision. Shine the light beam on the \npupil and look for the orange glow in the pupil\u2014the red reflex . Note \nany opacities interrupting the red reflex. If you are nearsighted and \nhave taken off your glasses, you may need to adjust the focusing \nwheel toward the minus/red diopters until the structures you see at \na distance is in focus.\n nNow place the thumb of your other \nhand across the patient\u2019s eyebrow , \nwhich steadies your examining \nhand. Keeping the light beam \nfocused on the red reflex, move \nin with the ophthalmoscope on \nthe 15\u00b0 angle toward the pupil \nuntil you are very close to it, \nalmost touching the patient\u2019s \neyelashes and the thumb of your \nother hand.\n nTry to keep both eyes open and relaxed, as if gazing into the \ndistance, to help minimize any fluctuating blurriness as your eyes \nattempt to accommodate.\nBates.indb   193Bates.indb   193 30-06-2023   11:44:5430-06-2023   11:44:54"

More than a third of adults older than 65 years have detectable \nhearing deficits.  Questionnaires and handheld audioscopes work well for \nperiodic screening.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) pointed out that the \neffectiveness of any hearing screening strategy will depend on how likely \nthose who might benefit from hearing aids are to actually use them. Con -\nsequently, it concluded that evidence was insufficient to make a determi -\nnation about screening adults 50 years of age and older for hearing loss \n(I statement). However, noise reduction and avoidance are recommended \nstrategies for preventing or delaying hearing loss.\nBates.indb   212Bates.indb   212 30-06-2023   11:45:0030-06-2023   11:45:00"

Inspect the oral cavity \nfor decayed or loose teeth, inflammation of the gingiva, signs of peri -\nodontal disease (bleeding, pus, receding gums, and bad breath), and oral \ncancers. Counsel patients to use fluoride-containing toothpastes, brush, \nfloss, and seek dental care at least annually.\nOral and Pharyngeal Cancer\nIn India, tobacco use is directly associated with almost 80% of oral cancer. \nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an increasingly important cause \nof oropharyngeal cancers (lesions of the tonsils, oropharynx, and base of \ntongue), accounting for about 70% of cases.\nThe primary screening test for these cancers is a thorough examination \nof the oral cavity.  Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nconcluded in 2014 that evidence was insufficient to recommend rou -\ntinely screening asymptomatic adults for oral cancer (I statement), the \nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) does recommend that patients with \na suspicious oral mucosal lesion be promptly referred to a specialist for \nbiopsy evaluation.\nBates.indb   221Bates.indb   221 30-06-2023   11:45:0230-06-2023   11:45:02"

According to \nWHO, India has 12% of the world\u2019s smokers. Smoked forms of tobacco \ninclude cigarette, bidi, cigar, and hookah  and smokeless forms include \ngutkha , snuff, and khaini consumed in many forms. Regularly counsel all \nadults, pregnant women, parents, and adolescents who smoke to stop. Use \n\u201cthe five As\u201d and the Stages of Change Model to assess readiness to quit.\nLatent Tuberculosis\nAs opposed to those with active tuberculosis, people with latent tuberculosis \nhave no symptoms and are not contagious. However, they may develop active \ntuberculosis if they do not receive treatment. The USPSTF favors screening in \nasymptomatic adults with the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma \nrelease assay (IGRA) blood tests (grade B recommendation).\nIn India, the National TB Elimination program (NTEP) currently recom -\nmends Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Interferon-Gamma Release Assay \n(IGRA) tests for tuberculosis infection (TBI). Testing for TBI by TST or \nIGRA is not a requirement for initiating TB preventive therapy (TPT) in \npeople living with HIV (PLHIV) or children aged < 5 years in contact \nwith pulmonary TB patients in India.\nNTEP has prioritized the following target population for TPT based on \nelevated risk of progression from infection to TB disease or increased like -\nlihood of exposure to TB disease: \na.

In India, \napproximately 70% of adult males smoke tobacco in some form. The cor -\nresponding figure for females is between 13% and 15%. Smoking increases \nthe risk of CHD and stroke by two- to fourfold compared to nonsmokers \nor past smokers. Family history of CHD is an important risk factor in \nyoung Indian patients and is thought to be due to modifiable physiolog -\nical variables such as blood pressure, lipids, and abdominal obesity which \nhave some genetic basis. In India, the prevalence of hypertension in adults \nis estimated to be approximately 30% (34% in urban areas and 28% in rural \nareas). The number of individuals suffering from hypertension is expected \nto double from 118 million in 2000 to 213.5 million by 2025. Apart from \nthese conventional risk factors, other lesser known causes include high \nlevels of stress and unhealthy living conditions. Also it has been postu -\nlated that maternal malnutrition or placental insufficiency may lead to low \nmuscle high fat type body composition, \u03b2 cell depletion, and formation \nof fewer glomeruli in children predisposing them to early cardiovascular \ndisease manifestations.\nPromoting Lifestyle Change and Risk Factor \nModification\nMotivating behavior change is challenging, but it is an essential clinical \nskill for promoting risk factor reduction.

It also occurs when the aortic root is dilated, \nprobably because the aortic valve is then closer to the chest wall.\nDecreased or Absent A 2, 2nd Right Interspace  is noted in calcific \naortic stenosis because of immobility of the valve. If A 2 is inaudible, no \nsplitting is heard.\nIncreased Intensity of P 2. When P 2 is equal to or louder than A 2, \npulmonary hypertension may be suspected. Other causes include a \ndilated pulmonary artery and an atrial septal defect. When a split S 2 is \nheard widely, even at the apex and the right base, P 2 is accentuated.\nDecreased or Absent P 2 is most commonly due to the increased \nanteroposterior diameter of the chest associated with aging. It can also \nresult from pulmonic stenosis. If P 2 is inaudible, no splitting is heard.\nBates.indb   288Bates.indb   288 30-06-2023   11:45:2630-06-2023   11:45:26"

It is the ratio of maximal cardiac \ndiameter to maximum thoracic diameter. In normal adults this is less than \n50% (CTR is equal to 1+2 divided by 3).\nShape of Heart\nRight heart border is formed by superior vena cava, right atrium, and \ninferior vena cava. Left border is formed from cranial to caudal by the \nsubclavian artery, aortic knuckle, pulmonary artery segment, left atrial \nappendage, left ventricle. \nLeft atrial enlargement (see Image 16-2, chest radiograph showing left \natrial enlargement) is seen characteristically in mitral valve disease, when it \nenlarges backward and to the right, appearing as an added density super -\nimposed on the central part of the heart. It causes elevation of left main \nbronchus with carinal widening. Enlarged atrial shadow may be seen to the \nright of right heart border called the double atrial shadow.  \nLeft ventricle enlargement is seen as enlargement of the apical region of heart.\nRight ventricular enlargement may also be seen in mitral disease because \nof increased pulmonary resistance.

In routine screening \nmammography of patients, bilateral craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral \noblique (MLO) views are usually taken.\nThe most widely accepted reporting schema for imaging of the breast is \nBI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System). It is a risk assess -\nment and quality assurance tool which has been developed by American \nCollege of Radiology. It applies to mammography, ultrasound, and MRI. \nIn this system, breast imaging is assigned one of the seven assessment \ncategories. The various categories are as follows:\n nBI-RADS 0: incomplete\n nBI-RADS 1: negative\n nBI-RADS 2: benign\n nBI-RADS 3: probably benign\n nBI-RADS 4: suspicious for malignancy\n nBI-RADS 5: highly suggestive of malignancy\n nBI-RADS 6: known biopsy-proven malignancy\nBates.indb   330Bates.indb   330 30-06-2023   11:45:3930-06-2023   11:45:39"

Urinary Incontinence*\nProblem Mechanisms\nStress Incontinence : Urethral sphincter weakened. \nTransient increases in intra-abdominal pressure raise \nbladder pressure to levels exceeding urethral resistance. \nLeads to voiding small amounts  during laughing, \ncoughing, and sneezing. nIn women, weakness of the pelvic floor with inadequate muscular support of the \nbladder and proximal urethra and a change in the angle between the bladder and \nthe urethra from childbirth, surgery, and local conditions affecting the internal \nurethral sphincter, such as postmenopausal atrophy of the mucosa and urethral \ninfection\n nIn men, prostatic surgery\nUrge Incontinence:  Detrusor contractions are stronger \nthan normal and overcome normal urethral resistance. \nBladder is typically small. Results in voiding moderate \namounts,  urgency, frequency, and nocturia. nDecreased cortical inhibition of detrusor contractions, as in stroke, brain tumor, \ndementia, and lesions of the spinal cord above the sacral level\n nHyperexcitability of sensory pathways, as in bladder infection, tumor, and fecal \nimpaction\n nDeconditioning of voiding reflexes, caused by frequent voluntary voiding at low \nbladder volumes\nOverflow Incontinence:  Detrusor contractions are \ninsufficient to overcome urethral resistance. Bladder is \ntypically large, even after an effort to void, leading to \ncontinuous dribbling. nObstruction of the bladder outlet, as by benign prostatic hyperplasia or tumor\n nWeakness of detrusor muscle associated with peripheral nerve disease at the sacral \nlevel\n nImpaired bladder sensation that interrupts the reflex arc, as in diabetic neuropathy\nFunctional Incontinence:  Inability to get to the toilet in \ntime because of impaired health or environmental \nconditions nProblems in mobility from weakness, arthritis, poor vision, other conditions; \nenvironmental factors such as unfamiliar setting, distant bathroom facilities, bed \nrails, physical restraints\nIncontinence Secondary to Medications:  Drugs may \ncontribute to any type of incontinence listed. nSedatives, tranquilizers, anticholinergics, sympathetic blockers, potent diuretics\n*Patients may have more than one kind of incontinence.\nBates.indb   359Bates.indb   359 30-06-2023   11:45:4530-06-2023   11:45:45"

Patient Instructions for the Testicular \nSelf-Examination\nThis examination is best performed after a warm bath or shower. \nThis way the scrotal skin is warm and relaxed.

You should also know that each normal testicle has a \nsmall, coiled tube (epididymis) that can feel like a small bump on the \nupper or middle outer side of the testicle. Normal testicles also have \nblood vessels, supporting tissues, and tubes that carry sperm. Some \nmen may confuse these with abnormal lumps at first.

The three-dose HPV \nvaccination series prevents HPV infection from these strains when given \nbefore  sexual exposure at age 11 years. The vaccine is also recommended \nfor unvaccinated and immunocompromised females up to age 26 years.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends \nroutine vaccination for females beginning at age 11 or 12 years, though \nvaccinations can be first given at age 9. Vaccination also recommended for \nfemales through age 26 who were not previously adequately vaccinated.\nWHO has recently updated the HPV vaccination schedule and recom -\nmends one or two-dose schedule for the girls aged 9-20 years and two \ndoses with a 6-month interval for women older than 20 years. Immuno -\ncompromised individuals, including those with HIV, should receive three \ndoses if feasible, and if not at least two doses.\nCervical Cancer Screening\nIn 2018, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave a grade \nA recommendation for screening average-risk women age 21 to 65 years \n(Box 21-2). They recommended against screening women younger than \nage 21, average-risk women older than 65 with adequate previous screen -\ning, and women who had undergone hysterectomy with removal of the \ncervix (D recommendations). In the latest ACS guideline in 2020 for \ncervical cancer screening, cervical cancer screening should begin in aver -\nage-risk individuals with a cervix at age 25 years and cease at age 65 years \nand that the preferred strategy for regular screening is primary HPV \ntesting every 5 years (Box 21-3).\nBOX 21-2.

Doubling the duration of the exercise of \nmoderate or severe intensity, i.e., 300 or 150 minutes respectively, \nwill lead to improved health benefits. These aerobic exercises \nshould be performed at bursts of at least 10 minutes each session \nand should be intermixed with muscle-strengthening (\u201canaerobic\u201d) \nexercises on 2 or more days a week. However, the predisposition \nof Indians for diabetes and coronary heart disease means that as \nmuch as 60 minutes per day of physical activity is recommended for \nhealthy Asian Indians. The suggested 60 minutes include 30 minutes \nof moderate-intensity aerobic activity, and 15 minutes each of work-\nrelated activity and muscle-strengthening exercises. For children and \nadolescents, this activity is best prescribed at 60 minutes per day of \nsports with moderate-intensity physical activity.\nLow Back Pain\nThe prevalence of low back pain in India is reported to be between 6.2 \nand 92%; the huge variation is attributed to the heterogeneity of the con -\nducted studies. Most patients with acute low back pain get better within 6 \nweeks; for patients with nonspecific symptoms, clinical guidelines empha -\nsize reassurance, staying active, analgesics, muscle relaxants, and spinal \nmanipulation therapy. About 10% to 15% of these patients develop chronic \nsymptoms, often associated with long-term disability. Poor outcomes are \nlinked to inappropriate beliefs about low back pain as a serious clinical \ncondition, maladaptive pain-coping behaviors (avoiding work, movement, \nor other activities for fear of causing back damage), multiple nonorganic \nphysical examination findings, psychiatric disorders, poor general health, \nhigh levels of baseline functional impairment, and low work satisfaction \n(see Box 23-6 in Low back Pain, p. 429).\nOsteoporosis: Risk Factors, Screening, and \nAssessing Fracture Risk\nOsteoporosis is a major public health threat and the prevalence of osteo -\nporosis among Indian men and women above 50 years is about 25% and \n43%, respectively. In the Indian population, osteoporosis and osteopenia \ncan be seen at a relatively younger age (Box 23-19).\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gives a grade B recom -\nmendation supporting osteoporosis screening for women aged \u226565 years \nand for younger women whose 10-year fracture risk equals or exceeds that \nof an average-risk 65-year-old white woman.\nBates.indb   457Bates.indb   457 30-06-2023   11:46:2130-06-2023   11:46:21"

These questions are not answered separately, but iteratively as you \nlearn about the patient during the interview and establish your neuro -\nlogic findings. To acquire the skills of nervous system examination, it is \nimportant to test your physical findings against those of your teachers and \nneurologists to refine your clinical expertise.\nGuiding Questions for Examination of the Nervous \nSystem\n nDoes the patient have neurologic disease?\n nIf so, what is the localization of the lesion or lesions? Are your \nfindings symmetric?\n nWhat is the pathophysiology of abnormal findings?\n nWhat is the preliminary differential diagnosis?\nThe nervous system can be divided into the central nervous system (CNS) \nand the peripheral nervous system (PNS), as shown in Figure 24-1.\nCentral Nervous System\nThe central nervous system  (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord.\nBrain . The brain has four regions: the cerebrum , the diencephalon , the \nbrainstem , and the cerebellum  (Fig. 24-2). Each cerebral hemisphere is \nsubdivided into frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.

Disorders of Speech\nDisorders of speech fall into three groups affecting: (1) phonation of the voice, (2) \nthe articulation of words, and (3) the production and comprehension of language.\n n Aphonia  refers to a loss of voice that accompanies disease affecting the larynx \nor its nerve supply. Dysphonia  refers to less severe impairment in the volume, \nquality, or pitch of the voice. For example, a person may be hoarse or only \nable to speak in a whisper. Causes include laryngitis, laryngeal tumors, and \nunilateral vocal cord paralysis (CN X).\n n Dysarthria  refers to a defect in the muscular control of the speech apparatus \n(lips, tongue, palate, or pharynx). Words may be nasal, slurred, or indistinct, \nbut the central symbolic aspect of language remains intact. Causes include \nmotor lesions of the central or peripheral nervous system, parkinsonism, and \ncerebellar disease.\n n Aphasia  refers to a disorder in producing or understanding language. It is often \ncaused by lesions in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, usually the left.\nCompared below are two common types of aphasia: (1) Wernicke, a fluent \n(receptive) aphasia, and (2) Broca, a non-fluent (or expressive) aphasia. There are \nother less common kinds of aphasia, which are distinguished by differing \nresponses on the specific tests listed. Neurologic consultation is usually indicated.\nWernicke Aphasia Broca Aphasia\nQualities of \nSpontaneous \nSpeechFluent; often rapid, voluble, \nand effortless. Inflection \nand articulation are good, \nbut sentences lack \nmeaning and words are \nmalformed ( paraphasias ) or \ninvented ( neologisms ). \nSpeech may be totally \nincomprehensible.Non-fluent; slow, with few \nwords and laborious effort. \nInflection and articulation are \nimpaired, but words are \nmeaningful, with nouns, \ntransitive verbs, and important \nadjectives. Small grammatical \nwords are often dropped.\nWord \nComprehensionImpaired Fair to good\nRepetition Impaired Impaired\nNaming Impaired Impaired, though the patient \nrecognizes objects\nReading \nComprehensionImpaired Fair to good\nWriting Impaired Impaired\nLocation of \nLesionPosterior superior \ntemporal lobePosterior inferior frontal lobe\nAlthough it is important to recognize aphasia early in your encounter with a \npatient, integrate this information with your neurologic examination as you \ngenerate your differential diagnosis.\nBates.indb   508Bates.indb   508 30-06-2023   11:46:3930-06-2023   11:46:39"

It also involves nonverbal modes of \ncommunication such as waving and head nodding.\n nSocial and emotional development  encompasses the child\u2019s ability to \nform and maintain relationships.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the use of stan -\ndardized screening instruments to assess these developmental domains.\nBates.indb   532Bates.indb   532 30-06-2023   11:46:4830-06-2023   11:46:48"

Y is extremely \nstubborn, frequently has tantrums, gets angry easily (especially with \nhis older sister), throws objects, bites, and physically strikes others \nwhen he doesn\u2019t get his way. His behavior seems worse around his \nfather who reports that he is \u201cfine\u201d at his childcare center. He moves \nfrom one activity to another with an inability to sit still to read or \nplay a game. Of note, he is sometimes affectionate and cuddly. He \ndoes make eye contact and plays normally with toys. He has no \nunusual movements.\nY is an extremely picky eater who eats a large quantity of junk \nfood and little else. He will not eat fruits or vegetables and drinks \nenormous quantities of juice and soda. His father has tried \neverything to get him to eat healthy food, to no avail.\nThe family has been under substantial stress during the past \nyear because Y\u2019s father has been self- employed, but the family is \nuninsured.\nY sleeps well through the night.\nMedications.

Common Concerns During Pregnancy \nand Their Explanations\nCommon \nConcernsTrimester Explanation\nAbdominal \npain (lower)Second Rapid growth in the second \ntrimester causes tension and \nstretching of round ligaments \nthat support uterus, causing \nsharp or cramping pain with \nmovement or position changeSee Algorithm \n26-1, Approach \nto the pregnant \npatient with \nabdominal pain, \np. 603.\nAbdominal \nstriaeSecond or \nthirdStretching of skin and tearing of collagen in \ndermis contribute to thin, usually pink, bands, or \nstriae gravidarum  (stretch marks). These may \npersist or fade over time after delivery.\nAmenorrhea \n(missed \nperiods)All High levels of estrogen, progesterone, and hCG \nbuild up endometrium and prevent menses, \ncausing a missed period, which is often the first \nnoticeable sign of pregnancy.\nBackache All Hormonally induced relaxation of the pelvic \nligaments contributes to musculoskeletal aches. \nLordosis required to balance the gravid uterus \ncontributes to lower back strain. Breast \nenlargement may contribute to upper backaches.\nBreast \ntenderness/\ntinglingFirst Pregnancy hormones stimulate growth of breast \ntissue, which causes swelling and possible \naching, tenderness, and tingling. Increased blood \nflow can make delicate veins more visible \nbeneath the skin.\nConstipation All Constipation results from slowed gastrointestinal \ntransit due to hormonal changes, dehydration \nfrom nausea and vomiting, and supplemental \niron in prenatal vitamins.\nContractions Third Irregular and unpredictable uterine contractions \n(Braxton Hicks  contractions) are rarely associated \nwith labor. Contractions that become regular or \npainful should be evaluated for onset of labor.\nEdema Third Decreased venous return, obstruction of \nlymphatic flow, and reduced plasma colloid \noncotic pressure commonly cause lower \nextremity edema. However, sudden severe edema \nand hypertension may signal preeclampsia.\ncontinued\nBates.indb   583Bates.indb   583 30-06-2023   11:47:0630-06-2023   11:47:06"

The gravid uterus also exerts \nphysical pressure against the stomach with \nincreasing gestational age.\nHemorrhoids All Hemorrhoids may be caused by constipation, \ndecreased venous return from increasing \npressure in the pelvis, compression by fetal parts, \nand changes in activity level during pregnancy.\nLoss of mucus \nplugThird Passage of mucus plug is common during labor \nbut may occur prior to the onset of contractions. \nAs long as there are no regular contractions, \nbleeding, or loss of fluid, loss of the mucus plug is \nunlikely to trigger the onset of labor.\nNausea and/or \nvomitingFirst Appears to reflect hormonal changes, slowed \ngastrointestinal peristalsis, alterations in smell \nand taste, and sociocultural factors. Up to 75% of \nwomen experience nausea in pregnancy. \nHyperemesis gravidarum  is vomiting with weight \nloss of >5% of prepregnancy weight.\nUrinary \nfrequencyAll Increases in blood volume and filtration rate \nthrough the kidneys result in increased urine \nproduction, while pressure from the gravid \nuterus reduces potential space for the bladder.\nVaginal \ndischargeAll Asymptomatic milky white discharge, leukorrhea , \nresults from increased secretions from vaginal \nand cervical epithelium due to vasocongestion \nand hormonal changes.\nMaternal Concerns and Attitudes\nReview the mother\u2019s feelings about the pregnancy and whether she \nplans to continue to term. Ask about any fears and about family support. \nRespect diverse family structures, such as extended family support, single \nmotherhood, or pregnancy conceived by donor sperm or oocyte and with \nor without a partner of either gender.\nBates.indb   584Bates.indb   584 30-06-2023   11:47:0630-06-2023   11:47:06"

Pay particular attention to issues that affect pregnancy, such as \nabdominal surgeries, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac conditions including \nany that were surgically corrected in childhood, asthma, hypercoagulability \nstates involving lupus or anticardiolipin antibodies, mental health disorders \nincluding postpartum depression, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, \nabnormal Pap smears, and exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero.\nPast Obstetric History\nAsk about prior pregnancies and outcomes (Box 26-2). Has she had any \ncomplications during past pregnancies? Were there any complications during \nlabor and delivery such as large babies ( fetal macrosomia ), fetal distress, \nor emergency interventions? What were the modes of previous deliveries: \nvaginal delivery, assisted delivery (vacuum or forceps), or cesarean section?\nBOX 26-2. Nomenclature for Pregnancy Outcomes\nThis is often part of any oral or written communication related to a \nwoman\u2019s reproductive history.\n nGravidity  refers to the number of times that a woman has been pregnant.\n nParity  is the number of times that she has given birth to a fetus to a \nviable age (\u226524 gestational weeks), regardless of whether the child \nwas born alive or was stillborn.\n nFor example:\n nA woman who is described as \u201cgravida 2, para 2\u201d (G2P2) has had \ntwo pregnancies and two deliveries after 24 weeks.\n nA woman who is described as \u201cgravida 2, para 0\u201d (G2P0) has had \ntwo pregnancies, neither of which survived to a gestational age \nof 24 weeks.\n nParity is further broken down into term deliveries, preterm deliveries, \nabortions  (spontaneous abortions and terminated pregnancies), \nand living children,  which yields the mnemonic \u201cTPAL\u201d when listed \nin that order.\n nA woman with two spontaneous losses prior to 20 weeks\u2019 ges -\ntation, three living children who were delivered at term, and a \ncurrent pregnancy, would be referred to as \u201cG6P3023. \u201d\n nIn practice, each pregnancy receives only one count in any of the \ncategories regardless of the number of fetuses, except for living \nchildren,  when all are counted.\n nOne common error is to assign a multiple pregnancy, for example, twins, \nas a count of two for either gravity or parity. So, for a first pregnancy with \ntwins delivered at term, the correct designation is G1P1002.\nBates.indb   585Bates.indb   585 30-06-2023   11:47:0630-06-2023   11:47:06"

Count the number of weeks and days from the \nfirst day of the LMP . If the actual date of conception is known (as \nwith in vitro fertilization), a conception age which is 2 weeks less \nthan the menstrual age can be used to calculate menstrual age  (i.e., \na corrected or adjusted LMP dating) to establish dating. Counting \nthis menstrual age from the LMP , although biologically distinct from \ndate of conception, is the standard means of calculating fetal age, \nyielding an average pregnancy length of 40 weeks.\n nExpected date of delivery (EDD).  The expected date of delivery \nis 40 weeks from the first date of the LMP . Using the Naegele \nrule,  the EDD can be estimated by taking the LMP , adding 7 days, \nsubtracting 3 months, and adding 1 year. For example:\n nLMP = November 26, 2020\n n+7 days = December 2, 2020\n n\u22123 months = September 2, 2020\n n+1 year = September 2, 2021 = EDD\n nTools for calculations.  Pregnancy wheels and online calculators \nare commonly used to calculate the EDD, but they should be \nchecked for accuracy.\n nLimitations on pregnancy dating.  Patient recall of the LMP \nis highly variable. The LMP can also be biased by hormonal \ncontraceptives, menstrual irregularities, or variations in ovulation \nthat result in atypical cycle lengths. Check LMP dating against \nphysical examination markers such as fundal height, clarifying \ndiscrepancies against ultrasound evaluation.\nSubsequent Prenatal Visits\nDuring subsequent visits, assess interim changes in the health status of the \nmother and fetus, review specific physical examination findings related to the \npregnancy, and provide counseling and timely preventive screenings. Obstet -\nric visits traditionally follow a set schedule: monthly until 28 gestational \nweeks, then biweekly until 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery. Update and \ndocument the history at every visit, especially fetal movement, contractions, \nleakage of fluids and vaginal bleeding. At every visit, assess vital signs (espe -\ncially blood pressure and weight), fundal \nheight, verification of FHR, and fetal \nposition and activity. At each visit, test \nthe urine for infection and protein.See Algorithm 26-2, Approach to \nthe Pregnant Woman with Vaginal \nBleeding, p. 604.\nBates.indb   587Bates.indb   587 30-06-2023   11:47:0630-06-2023   11:47:06"

Parity \nis further broken down into term deliveries, preterm deliveries, abortions \n(spontaneous abortions and terminated pregnancies), and living children, \n(which yields the mnemonic \u201cTPAL\u201d). \n nFor example, a woman who has had two prior children and is pregnant \nwith her third pregnancy would be referred to simply as \u201cG3P2.\u201d \n nA woman with two spontaneous losses prior to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, \nthree living children who delivered at term, and a current pregnancy, \nwould be referred to as \u201cG6P3023.\u201d \n nOne common error is to assign a multiple pregnancy, for example, \ntwins, as a count of two for either gravity or parity. In practice, each \npregnancy receives only one count in any of the categories regard -\nless of the number of fetuses, except for living children, when all are \ncounted. So, designate a first pregnancy with twins delivered at term \nas G1P1002.\nTypically, the write-up follows a standard order: age, Gs and Ps, weeks of \ngestation, means of determining gestational age (ultrasound vs. LMP), \nfollowed by chief complaint, chief pregnancy complications, then import -\nant history and examination findings.\nBates.indb   596Bates.indb   596 30-06-2023   11:47:0730-06-2023   11:47:07"

Pursue uni -\nversal screening in a neutral manner for:\n nTobacco.  Tobacco use accounts for up to 20% of all low-birth-weight babies. \nIt doubles the risk of placenta previa, placental abruption, and preterm \nlabor and increases risk of spontaneous abortion, fetal death, and fetal digit \nanomalies. Cessation is the goal, but any decrease in use is favorable.\n nAlcohol.  Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of preventable \nmental retardation in the United States. The American Congress of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) strongly recommends that \nwomen abstain throughout pregnancy.\n nIllicit drugs including narcotics.  Women with addictions should be \nreferred for treatment immediately and counseled and screened for \nhepatitis C and HIV.\n nAbuse of prescription drugs.  Ask about commonly abused prescription \ndrugs, including narcotics, stimulants, benzodiazepines.\n nHerbal and unregulated supplements.  Herbal supplements during preg -\nnancy may harm the developing fetus.\nIntimate Partner Violence\nPregnancy is a time of increased risk from intimate partner violence rang -\ning from verbal to physical abuse or from mild to severe physical abuse. \nUp to one in five women experiences some form of abuse during preg -\nnancy, contributing to delayed prenatal care, low infant birth weight, \nor even murder of the mother and fetus. ACOG recommends universal \nscreening of all women for domestic violence at the first prenatal visit and \nat least once each trimester.

Once the \npatient acknowledges abuse, ask about the best way for you to help her. \nRespect limits she places on sharing information, with the caveat that if \nchildren are involved, you may be required to report harmful behaviors \nto the authorities. Maintain an updated list of shelters, counseling centers, \nhotline numbers, and other trusted local referrals. Plan future appoint -\nments at more frequent intervals. Perform as thorough a physical examina -\ntion as the patient permits, and document all injuries on a body diagram.\nScreening for Perinatal Depression\nA 2018 study reported a 12% incidence of postpartum depression and a 17% \noverall prevalence of depression among healthy mothers without a prior \nhistory of depression. ACOG recommends that clinicians screen women \nat least once during the perinatal period for depression and anxiety symp -\ntoms using a standardized, validated tool.  Additionally, the USPSTF rec -\nommends that clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum persons \nwho are at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions \n(B recommendation).  Commonly used depression screening tools for the \npregnant or peripartum adult include the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression \nScale (EPDS) or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The EPDS \nconsists of 10 self-reported items, takes <5 minutes to complete, has been \ntranslated into 50 different languages, has a low required reading level, and \nis easy to score. The PHQ-9 is a brief nine-item questionnaire focused on \nthe nine diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV depressive disorders. It is one of the \nmost validated tools in mental health and can be a powerful tool to assist \nclinicians with diagnosing depression and monitoring treatment response.\nImmunizations\nAdminister Tdap during each pregnancy, ideally at 27 to 36 weeks of ges -\ntation, regardless of the prior immunization history, and to caretakers in \ndirect contact with the infant.

These significant alterations \nin physiology tend to have the most \nimpact during periods of stress, such as \nexposure to fluctuating temperatures, \ndehydration, or even shock.See Table 27-1. Selected Normal Ana -\ntomic and Physiologic Changes with \nAging and Related Disease Outcomes, \np. 635DEMOGRAPHIC IMPERATIVE\nAccording to Population Census 2011, there are nearly 104 million elderly \npersons (aged 60 years or above) in India and is projected to increase by \n20% by 2050. As per the National Health Profile 2019, the average life \nexpectancy of Indians is 68.7 years with male it is 67.4 years and female \nit is 70.2 years. The \u201cdemographic imperative\u201d is to maximize not only \nlifespan but also \u201chealth span\u201d so that older adults maintain full function \nfor as long as possible, enjoying rich and active lives in their homes and \ncommunities. This entails a focus on healthy or \u201csuccessful\u201d aging leading \nto interactive goals in clinical care\u2014an informed activated patient inter -\nacting with a prepared proactive team, resulting in high-quality satisfying \nencounters and improved outcomes and a distinct set of clinical attitudes \nand skills (Box 27-1).\nThe aging population displays marked heterogeneity. Investigators distin -\nguish \u201cusual\u201d aging, with its complex of diseases and impairments, from \noptimal aging. Optimal aging occurs in those people who escape debilitat -\ning disease entirely and maintain healthy lives late into their 80s and 90s. \nStudies of centenarians show that genes account for approximately 20% \nof the probability of living to 100, with healthy lifestyles accounting for \napproximately 20% to 30%.\nBates.indb   610Bates.indb   610 30-06-2023   11:47:1030-06-2023   11:47:10"

Consider dividing the initial assessment into \ntwo visits.\nEliciting Symptoms in the Older Adult\nOlder patients may overestimate their health even when increasing disease \nand disability are apparent. To reduce the risk of late recognition and \ndelayed intervention, adopt more directed questions or health screening \ntools. Consult with family members and caretakers.\nAcute illnesses present differently in older adults. Be sensitive to unusual \npresentations of myocardial infarction and thyroid disease. Older patients \nwith infections are less likely to have fever. Many clinical diseases simply \nmanifest as delirium or fall in old adults.\nRecognize the symptom clusters of different geriatric syndromes , charac -\nterized by interacting clusters of symptoms that lead to functional decline, \nfor example, falls, dizziness, depression, urinary incontinence, and func -\ntional impairment. Searching for the usual \u201cunifying diagnosis\u201d may per -\ntain to fewer than 50% of older adults.\nAlthough cognitive impairment may alter the patient\u2019s history, most older \nadults even with mild cognitive impairment can provide sufficient history \nto reveal current disorders. Use simple sentences with prompts to trigger \nnecessary information. If impairments are more severe, confirm symptoms \nwith family members or caregivers.\nAddressing Cultural Dimensions of Aging\nCultural differences affect the epidemiology of illness and mental health, \nacculturation, the specific concerns of the elderly, the potential for mis -\ndiagnosis, and disparities in health outcomes. Ask about spiritual advisors \nand native healers. Cultural values particularly affect decisions about the \nend of life.

Prevalence ranges from \n5% to 10% of older adults; however, many cases remain undetected.\nBed Sore (Pressure Sore)\nPressure sore is a localized injury of skin or underlying tissue over a bony \nprominence as a result of unrelieved pressure. A pressure more than arte -\nrial capillary pressure (approximately 30 mm Hg) can lead to compres -\nsion of capillaries and deprivation of oxygen and nutrition to the tissues. \nMore than 70% cases of bedsores occur in elderly patients >65 years of age \ngroup. Bed sores are more common in hospitalized patients and patients \nfrom nursing homes due to associated immobility, comorbid conditions, \nimmune deficiency, and poor nutrition. Decreased elasticity, decreased \ndermal blood flow, decreased subcutaneous fat, and changes in dermal \npH all contribute to higher risk of bedsores in elderly population.\nBates.indb   633Bates.indb   633 30-06-2023   11:47:1130-06-2023   11:47:11"

Bedsore should be examined for \nnumber, size, depth, exudates, undermining of edges, granulation tissue, \nevidence of necrosis, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, sinuses, osteomyelitis, \nand sepsis. Depending upon the depth of bedsore, it can be classified into \nthe following:\nStage 1. Intact skin with non-blanching redness \nStage 2.  Shallow open ulcer with red pink wound bed (partial thickness \ndermal involvement)\nStage 3. Full thickness tissue loss with visible subcutaneous fat \nStage 4. Full thickness tissue loss with exposed muscle and bone \nSerial photographs or scoring systems (PUSH [pressure ulcer scale for \nhealing] tool) can be used to serially follow-up the bed sore.\nHow to Prevent Pressure Sores in Elderly? There is no optimal sched -\nule for patient repositioning to prevent bed sores. Agency for health care \npolicy and research recommends repositioning every 2 hours in debili -\ntated patients. The patient should be positioned in an optimal position \nto decrease the shear stress (not less than 30 degrees to prevent risk of \naspiration). Pressure-reducing devices like air mattress, foam beds, water -\nbeds can be used. Dynamic pressure\u2013reducing devices are also available \nwhich will use a poweruse power source to redistribute localized pressure. \nImproving nutrition and local skin care are also important in preventing \nbed sore.\nManagement of Pressure Sores in the Elderly. Removing the necrotic \ntissue, absorption of exudates, preventing and treating superadded bac -\nterial infections, hydration of the wound are the principles of managing \nbed sore. Surgical debridement should be considered in cases of necrosis \nand evidence of advancing cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or sepsis. Local \nantibiotic application should be considered for nonhealing (more than \n2 to 4 weeks) grade 2 bed sores and grade 3 to 4 bed sores. Systemic \nantibiotics are only required in cases of cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and \nevidence of sepsis. Local application of antiseptic solutions like povidone \niodine and hydrogen peroxide should be avoided as they destroy the gran -\nulation tissue. Transparent semipermeable polyurethane membranes can \nbe considered for grade 1 bed sores. They allow inspection of the wound, \nprevent contamination with microorganisms, and hydration of the wound \nas they are permeable to vapor. For grade 2 to 4 wounds, gauze soaked \nwith saline, hydrogel, hydrocolloid, alginate, and foam packs can be \nconsidered.\nBates.indb   634Bates.indb   634 30-06-2023   11:47:1130-06-2023   11:47:11"
