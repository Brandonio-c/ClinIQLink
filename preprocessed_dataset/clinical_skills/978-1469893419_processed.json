Y ou must share your impressions with the \npatient and document your  ndings in the patient\u2019 s record in a succinct \nlegible format that communicates the patient\u2019 s story and physical  ndings, \nand the rationale for your assessment and plan, to other members of the \nhealth care team. A s you make clinical decisions, you will turn to clinical \nevidence, calling on your knowledge of sensitivity , speci city , predictive \nvalue, and the analytical tools detailed in Chapter 2, Evaluating Clinical \nEvidence.\nThe comprehensive health history and physical examination form the \nfoundation of your clinical Assessment.  The Plan is often wide-ranging \nand incorporates patient education, changes in medications, needed \ntests, referrals to other clinicians, and return visits for counseling \nand support. A successful Plan includes the patient\u2019 s responses to the \nproblems identi ed and to the interventions that you recommend. It \nrequires good interpersonal skills and sensitivity to the patient\u2019 s goals, \neconomic means, competing responsibilities, and family structure and \ndynamics."

Make a list of the patient\u2019 s symptoms,  \nthe signs you observed during the physical examination, and any labora-\ntory reports available to you.\nLo c a lize  Th e s e  Fin d in g s  An a t o m ic a lly. Often this step is straight-\nforward. The symptom of scratchy throat and the sign of an erythematous \nin amed posterior pharynx, for example, clearly localize the problem to \nthe pharynx. A  complaint of headache leads you quickly to the structures \nof the skull and brain. Other symptoms, however, may present greater \ndif culty . Chest pain, for example, can originate in the coronary arteries, \nthe stomach and esophagus, or the muscles and bones of the thorax. If the \npain is exertional and relieved by rest, either the heart or the musculoskel-\netal components of the chest wall may be involved. If the patient notes \npain only when carrying groceries with the left arm, the musculoskeletal \nsystem becomes the likely culprit.\nWhen localizing  ndings, be as speci c as your data allow; however, you \nmay have to settle for a body region, such as the chest, or a body system, \nsuch as the musculoskeletal system. On the other hand, you may be able \nto de ne the exact structure involved, such as the left pectoral muscle. \nSome symptoms and signs are constitutional and cannot be localized, such \nas fatigue or fever, but are useful in the next set of steps.\nCluster the Clinical Findings. Several clinical characteristics may help.\n \u25a0Patient age:  The patient\u2019 s age may help; younger adults are more likely \nto have a single disease, whereas older adults tend to have multiple \ndiseases."

For example, an \nepisode of pharyngitis 6 weeks ago is probably unrelated to the fever, chills, \npleuritic chest pain, and cough that prompted an of ce visit today . T o use \ntiming effectively , you need to know the natural history of various diseases \nand conditions. A yellow penile discharge followed 3 weeks later by a \npainless penile ulcer suggests two problems: gonorrhea and primary syphilis.\n \u25a0Involvement of different body systems:  If symptoms and signs occur in a \nsingle system, one disease may explain them. Problems in different, \napparently unrelated, systems often require more than one explanation. \nFor example, you might decide to group a patient\u2019 s high blood pressure \nand sustained apical impulse together with  ame-shaped retinal hemor-\nrhages, place them in the cardiovascular system, and label the constella-\ntion \u201chypertensive cardiovascular disease with hypertensive retinopathy .\u201d\n \u25a0Multisystem conditions:  With experience, you will become increasingly \nadept at recognizing multisystem conditions  and building plausible expla-\nnations that link manifestations that are seemingly unrelated. T o explain \ncough, hemoptysis, and weight loss in a 60-year-old plumber who has \nsmoked cigarettes for 40 years, you would rank lung cancer high in \nyour differential diagnosis. Y ou might support your diagnosis with your \nobservation of the patient\u2019 s cyanotic nailbeds.\n \u25a0Key questions:  Y ou can also ask a series of key questions  that may steer \nyour thinking in one direction and allow you to temporarily ignore \nthe others. For example, you may ask what produces and relieves the \npatient\u2019 s chest pain. If the answer is exercise and rest, you can focus on \nthe cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems and set the gastrointes-\ntinal (GI) system aside. If the pain is epigastric, you can logically focus \non the GI tract. A series of discriminating questions helps you analyze \nthe clinical data and reach logical explanations.\nSearch for the Probable Cause of the Findings. Patient com-\nplaints often stem from a pathologic process  involving diseases of a body \nsystem or structure. These processes are commonly classi ed as congenital, \nin ammatory or infectious, immunologic, neoplastic, metabolic, nutritional, \ndegenerative, vascular, traumatic, and toxic.\nOther problems are pathophysiologic,  re ecting derangements of biologic \nfunctions, such as heart failure or migraine headache. Still other problems \nare psychopathologic,  such as disorders of mood like depression or headache \nas an expression of a somatic symptom disorder.\nGenerate Hypotheses About the Causes of the Patient\u2019 s \nProblem.

Some patients cannot provide their \nown histories because of delirium, dementia, or other conditions. Others \ncannot relate certain parts of the history . In such cases, determine whether \nthe patient has decision-making capacity ,  or the ability to understand informa-\ntion related to health, to make clinical choices based on reason and a con-\nsistent set of values, and to declare preferences about treatments. Capacity  is \na clinical designation and can be assessed by clinicians, whereas competence  \nis a legal designation and can only be decided by a court. If a patient lacks \ncapacity to make a health care decision, then identify the health care proxy \nor the agent with power of attorney for health care. If the patient had not \nidenti ed a surrogate decision maker, then that role may shift to a spouse or \nfamily member. It is critical to remember that decision-making capacity is both \n\u201ctemporal and situational.\u201d  It can  uctuate depending on the condition of  \nthe patient and the complexity of the decision involved. Many patients with \npsychiatric or cognitive de cits still retain the ability to make decisions.\nFor patients with capacity , obtain their consent before talking about their \nhealth with others.

Recognizing mental illness is \nespecially important given its signi cant prevalence and morbidity , the \nhigh likelihood that it is treatable, the shortage of psychiatrists, and the \nincreasing importance of primary care clinicians as the  rst to encounter \nthe patient\u2019 s distress. The prevalence of mental health disorders in U.S. \nadults in 2012 was 18%, affecting 43.7 million people; yet, only 41% \nreceived treatment. Even for those receiving care, adherence to treatment \nguidelines in primary care of ces is <50% and disproportionately lower \nfor ethnic minorities.\nMental health disorders are commonly masked by other clinical condi-\ntions. Look for the interaction of anxiety and depression in patients \nwith substance abuse, termed \u201cdual diagnosis,\u201d because both must be \ntreated for the patient to achieve optimal function. Watch for underly-\ning psychiatric conditions in \u201cdif cult encounters\u201d and patients with \nunexplained symptoms. Explore the outlook of patients with chronic \nillness, a group that is especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety . \nNearly half of those with any single mental disorder meet the criteria \nfor one or more additional disorders, with severity strongly related to \ncomorbidity .\nAp p roximately 5% of som atic sym p tom s are acu te, tr igger in g im m ed iate \nevaluation. Another 70% to 75% are minor or self-limited and resolve \nin 6 weeks. Nevertheless, approximately 25% of patients have persist-\ning and recurrent symptoms that elude assessment and fail to improve. \nOverall, 30% of symptoms are medically unexplained,  masking anxiety , \ndepression, or even somatoform disorders (see T able 5-1, Somatoform \nDisorders: T ypes and Approach to Symptoms, p. 87). Depression and \nanxiety are highly correlated with substance abuse, for example, and \nclinicians are advised to look for overlap in these conditions. \u201cDif cult \npatients\u201d  are frequently those with multiple unexplained symptoms and \nunderlying psychiatric conditions that are amenable to therapy . Without \nbetter \u201cdual diagnosis,\u201d patient health, function, and quality of life are \nat risk."

The metabolic syndrome  consists of a cluster of \nrisk factors which confer and increased risk of both CV D and diabetes. In \n2009, the International Diabetes A ssociation and other societies harmo-\nnized diagnostic criteria as the presence of three or more of the  ve risk \nfactors listed below.\nOther Risk Factors: Smoking, Family History, and Obesity. Smoking  \nincreases the risk of CHD and stroke by two- to fourfold compared to non-\nsmokers or past smokers who quit >10 years previously; about 14% of U.S. \ncardiovascular deaths are attributed to smoking annually . Among adults, 13% \nreport a family history  of heart attack or angina before age 50 years. Along \nwith a family history of premature revascularization, this risk factor is associ-\nated with about a 50% increased lifetime risk for CHD and for CVD mortality . \nObesity , or B MI over 30 kg/m2, contributed to 112,000 excess adult deaths \ncompared to those of normal weight, and was associated with 13% of CVD \ndeaths in 2004.\nProm oti ng L i festyl e Change and Ri sk F actor \nMo d i f i c at i o n\nMotivating behavior change is challenging, but it is an essential clinical \nskill for promoting risk factor reduction.

When a split S 2 is \nheard widely , even at the apex and the right base, P 2 is accentuated.\nDecreased or Absent P 2 is most commonly due to the increased \nanteroposterior diameter of the chest associated with aging.

Adolescents \nare more likely to open up when the interview focuses on them rather than \non their problems.\nConsider the patient\u2019 s cognitive and social development when deciding \nissues of privacy , parental involvement, and con dentiality . Explain to \nboth teens and parents that the purpose of con dentiality is to improve \nhealth care, not keep secrets. Y our goal is to help adolescents bring their \nconcerns or questions to their parents. Never make con dentiality unlim-\nited, however. Always state to teens explicitly that you may need to act on \ninformation that makes you concerned about safety .\nThe physical examination of the adolescent is similar to that of the adult. \nKeep  in  min d  issu es p articu larly relevan t to teen s, su ch  as p u berty, growth , \ndevelopment, family and peer relationships, sexuality , decision making, \nand risk behaviors. For more details on speci c techniques of examina-\ntion, the reader should refer to the corresponding chapter for the regional \nexamination of interest or concern. Following are special areas to highlight \nwhen examining adolescents."
