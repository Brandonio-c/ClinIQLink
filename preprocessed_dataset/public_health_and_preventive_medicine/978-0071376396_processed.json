            "Text": "INTRODUCTION\nPreventive Medicine and Public Health: PreTest \u00aeSelf-Assessment and Review,\nNinth Edition, has been designed to provide medical students and physicians\nwith a comprehensive and convenient instrument for self-assessment andreview within the field of epidemiology and public health. The 500 questionsprovided have been designed to parallel the format of the questions containedin Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).\nEach question in the book is accompanied by an answer, a paragraph\nexplanation, and a specific page reference to either a current journal article,a textbook, or both. A bibliography that lists all the sources used in thebook follows the last chapter.\nPerhaps the most effective way to use this book is to allow yourself one\nminute to answer each question in a given chapter; as you proceed, indi-cate your answer beside each question. By following this suggestion, youwill be approximating the time limits imposed by licensing examinations.\nWhen you practice your examination-taking skills with this PreTest\n\u00ae,\none way to maximize your score is to go through, answer all the questionsyou find easy , and skip over the more difficult ones initially . We do recom-mend, however, that once you come back to the more difficult questions,you spend as much time as you need. You will then be more likely to retainthe information. Do note: When it comes to your examination for the board,\nyou will do better to answer each question as you come to it and not skiparound. Do not spend too much time on any one problem. Make a guess,circle the question, and come back to it. Otherwise, you can waste timelooking for the questions you skipped or\u2014the ultimate tragedy\u2014you maydiscover time is running out.\nWhen you have finished answering the questions in a chapter, you\nshould then spend as much time as you need verifying your answers andcarefully reading the explanations. Although you should pay special atten-tion to the explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly , youshould read every explanation. The author of this book has designed theexplanations to reinforce and supplement the information tested by thequestions. If, after reading the explanations for a given chapter, you feelyou need still more information about the material covered, you may wishto consult the references indicated.\nix"

The\nmultiplicative rule applies to independent events. The probability of a neg-ative test if there is cancer can be expressed as p(test\n\u2212/ disease+) and is\nequal to 1 \u2212sensitivity (1 \u22120.9=0.1), or the false-negative rate. The prob-\nability of two negative consecutive tests is (0.1)(0.1) =0.01 =1/100. The\nprobability that a woman who has cancer will test negative decreases withthe number of mammographies done. This is inherent to the sensitivity ofthe test. The higher the sensitivity , the lower the probability of false-negative tests as they are repeated.\n2.The answer is c. (Greenberg, 2/e, pp 106-109.) This study is a prospec-\ntive cohort study because the subjects (pregnant women) were categorizedon the basis of exposure or lack of exposure to a risk factor (smoking dur-ing pregnancy), and then were followed to determine if a particular out-come (low-birth-weight babies) resulted. The term cohort refers to the\ngroup of subjects who are followed forward in time to see which onesdevelop the outcome. Clinical trials are prospective studies in which anintervention is applied\u2014no intervention was mentioned in the question: itwould be unethical to assign one or the other group to smoking. In a case-control study of the relationship between low birth weight and maternalsmoking, infants would be selected on the basis of low birth weight (cases)and normal birth weight (controls) and then the frequency of maternalsmoking would be compared in the two groups. In cross-sectional studies,exposure and outcome are measured at the same point in time.

(Ingelfinger , 3/e, pp 198-202.) Although hypertension\ncan resolve spontaneously , this is an unlikely explanation for resolutionover a two-week period in 35% of the subjects. A much more likely expla-nation is regression toward the mean. Because of random fluctuations, anyone measurement of blood pressure may be far from a persons normalblood pressure. By referring patients for the study based on a single mea-\nsurement, those in whom the measurement was high (which proved laternot to reflect the actual BP) are much more likely to be referred than thosein whom the measurement was too low. Thus, in any group selected basedon a characteristic with substantial day-to-day variation, many will havevalues closer to the population mean when the measurement is repeatedand the worst patients will impr ove. Neither baseline drift (which occurswith measurements on certain machines that require frequent calibration)nor measurement error is as likely an explanation. The Hawthorne effectrefers to a tendency among study subjects to change simply because theyare being studied. It is much more likely to affect studies of behavior orattitudes than a study of blood pressure.\n4.The answer is d. (Greenberg, 2/e, pp 18-19.) Person-years of observa-\ntion are frequently used in the denominator of incidence rates and providea method of dealing with variable follow-up periods. Person-years of obser-vation simultaneously take into account the number of persons underobservation and the duration of observation of each person. For example,if eight new cases of diabetes occurred among 1000 people followed fortwo years, the incidence would be 8 cases per 2000 person-years, or 4 per1000 person-years of follow-up. The distinction between rates and pro-portions is not well maintained in standard epidemiologic terminology .\nRates should have units of inverse time and will vary depending on theunits of measurement of time; they can vary from 0 to infinity . However,\nsuch terms as case fatality rate, attack rate, andprevalence rate are in wide-\nspread usage even though technically they are all proportions; that is, theyvary between 0 and 1 and are unitless.\n5.The answer is d.

In this case, themean is 31/9 =3.4. The median is the middle observation in a series of\nordered observations, that is, the 50th percentile.

In experimental studies, the\ninvestigators determine exposure of the study and control groups to a sus-pected causal factor and measure responses in the two groups. In observa-tional studies, investigators have no control over exposure to a suspectedcausal factor but can measure responses in those who are and are not exposed.In both types of studies, the attempt is made to use study and control groupssimilar in regard to all variables except exposure to the factor under study .\n12.The answer is c. (Greenberg, 2/e, pp 136140, 123-126.) Recall bias, a\nform of information bias and differential misclassification, occurs whencases are more likely to recall past events than controls. Indeed, personsexperiencing a bad outcome may be more likely to search their past (andprod their memory) about potential causes for the occurrence. This is a par-ticular problem with case-control studies. Recall bias could cause a falselyhigh odds ratio; it is potentially a problem when using maternal recall toinvestigate exposures associated with birth defects. In this case, motherswith children with undescended testes may be more accurate in quantifyingsmoking habits. Because this misclassification of exposure is not random inboth the case and controls, it is termed differential misclassification. Non-differential misclassification occurs when the memory of an exposure isunrelated to the fact that a person has a disease or not. It is often the conse-quence of an imprecise measurement of exposure (remembering specificnutrition information that occurred many months ago). The importantpoint to remember is that differential misclassification may result in an over-estimate of an association while nondifferential misclassification nearlyalways causes the results to move toward the null (no association). Selectionbias refers to systematic errors in the way subjects are included in a study .Confounding occurs when the apparent effect of an exposure is partly orentirely due to a third factor associated with both exposure and outcome.Although a third factor could potentially be present, it has not been identi-fied here, and the major concern in this case should be the recall bias.\n13.The answer is b.

Thus, a 95% confidenceinterval shows the numbers that are not significantly different statisticallyfrom what was observed at the 5% level. The lower the level of confidence,the narrower the confidence interval, so a 90% confidence interval would benarrower than a 95% confidence interval, in this case excluding 1.0 for cer-tain.

Rapidly progressive cancers will be less likely to be detected by a\nscreening test if symptoms rapidly develop because the window periodbetween the time the cancer can be detected when it is asymptomatic by ascreening test and the time it will become clinically apparent is short. Thisis described as length bias. Screening tests are more effective in terms of pro-\nlonging life (or other desirable outcomes) when they are used to detect moreslowly growing tumors. Lead-time bias occurs when the screening testadvances the time of diagnosis, but no true prolongation of life occursbecause survival for persons who are screened and those who are not is thesame from the time the cancer occurs. Information bias occurs when thereis a systematic difference in the way data are collected (inaccurate or impre-cise measure) for either the exposure or the outcome. Recall bias is one formof information bias (see answer for question 12) and refers to what one mayremember for an exposure, so it is irrelevant here. Selection bias occurswhen the inclusion of a subject in a study group is linked to the exposure ofinterest. As an example for a case-control study , if women who use oral con-traceptives are suspected more often of having deep vein thrombosis (DVT),they would be hospitalized more often for evaluation and diagnosed moreoften than controls. Selection bias can also occur in cohort studies and isrelated to differential loss to follow-up. Surveillance bias refers to overde-tection of the disease of interest because one of the groups goes to the doc-tor (or has a diagnostic test) more often than does another group. Forexample, women who take postmenopausal estrogens presumably go to thedoctor (and probably have mammograms) more frequently than womenwho do not; thus, women who take estrogens may be more likely to havebreast cancers detected because of the increased surveillance.\n17.The answer is b.

These definitions can be illustrated as follows:\nDisease Present Disease Absent\nTest positive True positive (TP) False-positive (FP)\nTest negative False-negative (FN) True negative (TN)Sensitivity =TP / (TP +FN) Specificity =TN/(TN +FP)\nAmong people who have the disease, there are two possibilities: either the\ntest correctly identifies them (TP), or it falsely classifies them as negative(FN). Thus, among those with disease, sensitivity measures how often thetest gives the right answer. (A good way to remember sensitivity is by theinitials PID: positive in disease.) Similarly , among people who do not havethe disease, there are also two possibilities: either the test will correctlyidentify them as not having disease (TN), or it will falsely classify them asdiseased (FP). Thus, specificity measures how often the test gives the rightanswer among those who do not have the disease. (A good way to remem-ber specificity is by the initials NIH: negative in health.)\nAs opposed to sensitivity and specificity , which measure the tests per-\nformance in groups of patients who do and do not have the disease, pre-dictive value measures how often the test is right in patients groupedanother way: by whether the test result is positive or negative. Thus, pre-dictive value of a positive test is the proportion of positive tests that are truepositives [TP/(TP +FP)], and predictive value of a negative result is the\nproportion of negative test results that are true negatives [TN/(TN +FN)].\nBut predictive value is a little tricky because it also depends on the\nprevalence of the disease in the population tested. In this case, Dr. Stewellsassembled groups of 100 patients with and without cholera, and the preva-lence is not given.

As the prevalence falls, more\nand more of those tested will not have cholera.

It is used toeliminate bias on the part of the investigator and the subject in the choiceof treatment group. The goal of randomization is to allow chance to dis-tribute unknown sources of biologic variability equally to the treatmentand control groups. However, because chance does determine assignment,significant differences between the groups may arise, especially if the num-ber of subjects is small.

This technique is not used for large cohort stud-ies as it would often be too time-consuming, restrictive, and expensive tofind a match for each subject entering the study . Therefore, controlling forconfounding is done in the analysis when a large group is recruited. Match-ing is mainly used when dealing with small case-control studies where thenumber of subjects enrolled would be too small to yield statistical results ifstratified by subgroups. Randomization is used in clinical trials to controlconfounding (sample size needs to be large\u2014see the answer to question20). Matching cannot be used in correlation studies or cross-sectional stud-ies: these are descriptive studies to assess disease occurrence and they donot have control groups to test a hypothesis.\n27-28. The answers are 27-b, 28-a. (Greenberg, 2/e, pp 94-97.) In order\nto maximize compliance, a researcher can assess the compliance of subjectsby giving them either the active or inert medication for a certain period oftime, before the randomization for the study has occurred. Noncompliantpersons can be dropped from the entire study population and the compliantpersons are then randominzed to receive either active or inert medication(placebo). This technique was used for the physicians health study todetermine if the use of aspirin would reduce cardiovascular mortality . Keep-ing logs and frequent contacts from research staff can also help maintaincompliance. The use of the placebo is to assess for responses that may sim-ply be attributed to receiving an intervention, whether active or inert. It hasbeen shown that even patients who receive inert medication can do betterthan if receiving nothing. Therefore, they need to represent the controlgroup of any clinical trial to account for the placebo ef fect.

Line graphs\nare useful for presenting continuous data over time within different popula-tions. In fact, in most cases, the horizontal axis scale in line graphs representstime in year, months, and so forth. Frequency polygons are used to illustratefrequency distributions for discrete or continuous data. More than one set ofdata can be superimposed for comparison. The horizontal axis often repre-sents measure of the variable of interest (e.g., cholesterol) and the verticalaxis represents the distribution either in numbers, relative frequency , orcumulative frequency . Histograms can also be used for this purpose, one setof data at a time. The horizontal axis should represent the true limits of inter-vals between data points (upper and lower limit) and the vertical axis shouldbegin at zero. A bar chart is used to depict the frequency distribution of nom-inal or ordinal data. Only one set of data is represented for each chart. Piecharts can be used to illustrate relative frequencies of categorical data.

There is always a trade-off\nbetween sensitivity and specificity as no test is ever 100% sensitive and100% specific. Each curve can be used to determine the optimal cut-offpoint for the respective test. In general, the point closest to the upper-leftcorner, where sensitvity is highest and the false-positive rate is lowest, ischosen as the cut-off. The area under the curve is used to calculate the diag-nostic accuracy (best combined sensitivity and specificity) of the test, thatis, the probability of correctly identifying disease or no disease based on theresult of the test. The larger the area under the curve, the better the test.In this example, test C has the largest area under the curve compared to theother tests, and therefore would have the greatest diagnostic accuracy .\n54.The answer is c.

Sensitivity analysis is\nused in decision analysis to determine how much impact different proba-bilities of a particular event will have on the choice of choosing one inter-vention over another. Computer programs can compute and plot thesedata. The maximum quality-adjusted life expectancy or years (or QALYs)for surgery is 4.5 and for radiation is 4.2. QALYs are plotted for radiationtherapy and surgery for different probabilities of mortality from surgery . As\nexpected, mortality from surgery does not impact the QALYs obtained from\nradiation therapy . However, as mortality from surgery increases, the QALYsfor that intervention decrease. If mortality did not impact QALYs forsurgery , you would obtain a straight line with the ycoordinate at 4.5. The\nthreshold is the point at which both interventions intersect: decisions willbe made above or below that point. In this case, surgery is superior to radi-ation if the mortality is below 11%. However, if the mortality from surgeryis higher than 11%, then you gain more QALYs from radiation therapy .

Both studies have the\nsame relative risk (0.6/1.3 and 9.2/20 =0.46). The intervention reduces\nthe mortality by more than 50%. The relative risk reduction is expressed asrisk of mortality in the intervention group (RI) \u2212risk of mortality in the\ncontrol group (RC)/RC. For study A: |0.6 \u22121.3|/1.3 =0.54 and for study B:\n|9.2\u221220|/20 =0.54. It represents the proportional reduction in rates of a\nbad event between the inter vention group and the control group, and\nbasically gives similar information as the relative risk. These two measuresare useful to determine the magnitude of the effect of a given intervention.These measures can be misleading in assessing the clinical relevance of anintervetion because the overall impact of the intervention is highly depen-dent on the rate of mortality in the control. In study A, the rate in the con-trol group is very low. Thus, even if the relative risk is very high, theintervention is associated with little overall gain. The absolute risk reduc-tion (ARR) is expressed as RI \u2212RC. It is the arithmetic difference between\nthe two groups, or the same as attributable risk. We say reduction if the\nintervention reduces the risk and increase if the intervention increases a\nparticular risk (not meaning a bad outcome). For study A, the ARR is equalto a reduction of 0.7%, and for study B, it is equal to a reduction of 10.8%.This measure gives a better picture of the impact of an intervention andhow much benefit can be attributed to the intervention. We can see that theintervention used in study B would provide more benefit than the inter-vention used in study A. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) are expressed as1/ARR. This gives us an estimate of how many patients will need the inter-vention before we can avoid one bad outcome, and can be useful for clini-cians to get a perspective on the intervention in their practices.\n58.The answer is c.

Effect modification provides important information: the magni-tude of the effect of a particular exposure on the outcome will vary accord-ing to the presence of a third factor, in this case, gender. It is not related tothe fact that there may be more men than women in one group or another.A third factor can be both a confounder and an effect modifier if theadjusted risk differs from the crude, in addition to having different risks inwomen and in men.

This isa question of judging whether the subjects in the study are similar to thepopulation you are interested in applying the results to (such as patients inyour clinical practice). Power refers to the capability of a study to detectstatistically significant results. Reliability is synonymous with precision:even though the results in the study described in question 69 reached sta-tistical significance (the CI does not include 1), there is a very large confi-dence interval, suggesting that the study is not precise (increased randomerror).

As an example, a high bilirubin seems to bea much stronger risk factor for bilirubin-induced brain damage if the babyis sick in other ways (see question 58.)\nConfounding occurs when the association between two variables is\ndistorted by the fact that both are associated with a third. For example, theassociation between coffee and lung cancer is distorted by smoking: amongnonsmokers and smokers considered separately , coffee and lung cancermay be completely unrelated, but when the two groups are combined, anassociation appears to be present. Similarly , lead levels need to be related toIQ separately at each level of socioeconomic status to assure that the asso-ciation is not due to confounding. The possibility that hyperactive childrenhave high lead levels because they are hyperactive, rather than vice versa,is not confounding; it is simply a case in which the direction of causality isturned around (effect-cause). Nondifferential misclassification results inthe mixing of two groups because the measure of either the exposure or theoutcome was imprecise, for example, assessing precise diet habits by ques-tionnaires in a case-control study , and going back many years.

The case fatality rate is a measure of the severity of the disease. It is\na ratio of the number of deaths caused by a disease to the total number ofcases of that disease and is usually expressed as a percentage. The crudemortality equals the total number of deaths from all causes during a yeardivided by the average population at risk during that year. It is usuallyexpressed as the number of deaths per 1000 people. The secondary attackrate is a measure of the contagiousness of an infectious disease. Thenumerator is the number of cases of disease in contacts of the index case;the denominator is the number of contacts exposed to the index case dur-ing a specified period. Rates of disease are called morbidity rates.\n91-94. The answers are 91-b, 92-a, 93-e, 94-b. (Greenberg, 2/e, pp\n19-21, 125. Rosner , 5/e, pp 591-596.) Matching is a way of selecting subjects\nthat are comparable with respect to specific variables.

It is thus a sampling strategy to achieve comparability among groups.\nStratification is an analysis strategy with the same purpose.

            "Text": "groups can occur within each stratum. For example, survival could be\ncompared separately in different age strata, as in question 91. This mightbe important if the subjects with high renin levels were also older than thesubjects with low levels, since a difference in survival between the twogroups might be due to age, rather than to differing renin levels.\nAge adjustment takes stratification by age one step further. After mor-\ntality (or another parameter) is calculated for specific age strata, it is com-bined in a weighted average to yield a single number. The weights used arethe sizes of the different age strata in a standard population. Age adjust-ment is used more often for comparing mortality in populations with dif-fering age structures.\nMultivariate statistical analysis, like stratification, is an analysis tech-\nnique for achieving comparability among groups. It involves modeling theassociations between variables in order to allow their different effects to beisolated from each other. (For example, in multiple regression, the rela-tionships between variables are modeled as a straight line.)\nSurvival analysis is a technique by which persons followed for variable\nlengths of time are counted according to the length of time they were fol-lowed. For example, in the cohort study of renin levels mentioned previ-ously , instead of simply comparing the proportions surviving five years, thecumulative probability of survival could be plotted for the two groups, andthe two curves compared. The Kaplan-Meier and life table analysis are twomethods used for survival analysis. The first plots the percentage of per-sons alive after each year since a diagnosis.\n95-98.

Age-specific attack rates that incorporate the number of\ncases in each age group, divided by the number of persons in each group,should be calculated.\nIn order to determine that an association between two conditions such\nas diabetes and obesity exists, an investigator must show that obesity is sig-nificantly more common in persons who have diabetes than in personswho do not have diabetes.

Because death may be amajor reason for loss to follow-up, the most conservative approach is toassume that everyone lost to follow-up has died. Unless, in this example,the death rate in the anxiety neurosis cohort was still no greater than thatin the general population (after adding another 50 deaths for the 20% ofthe 250 patients lost to follow-up), the conclusions are suspect.\nThe conclusion in question 98 is invalid because of the lack of denom-\ninators to calculate the rate of bacterial endocarditis in different age groups.In addition, the autopsy series merely gives an estimate of the proportionof deaths in different age groups, not the frequency of occurrence of endo-carditis with age. The autopsy series may also be invalid as a source of datafrom which to draw conclusions because of factors that determinedwhether an autopsy was performed.\n99-102.

When constructing a decision analysis tree, the first node is a\ndecision node to reflect the choices you have to make to manage a specificmedical problem. Branches from the chance nodes must reflect all possi-bilities. Terminal nodes reflect the outcomes or utilities assigned to the out-comes, such as death, survival, quality-adjusted life years, and so forth.The tree is folded back fr om right to left to get the expected utilities foreach choice of action. Thus, the utilities are expressed in the same units asthe outcomes (e.g., probability of survival, quality-adjusted life years).Here, the utility for surgery is equal to (0 \u00d70.05) +{[(4.4 \u00d70.05) +(4.8 \u00d7\n0.95)] \u00d70.95} =4.5.

The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of exposure to the risk factor\ngiven disease ( a/c) to the odds of exposure to the risk factor given no dis-\nease ( b/d). To illustrate that the odds of exposure given disease are a/c,the\nprobability of exposure given disease is 5 a/(a+c). So (1 \u2212p)=c/(a+c), and\nthe odds are [ a/(a+c)]/[c/(a+c)], and the ( a+c) phrases cancel out to give\na/c.The odds ratio, therefore, is ( a/c) / (b/d), which equals ad/bc.62 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

Whereas the relative risk andodds ratio are unitless (since any measurements of time in the denomina-tors cancel out), the excess risk must have an explicit or implied timeperiod in the denominator. In this example, a/(a+b)\u2212c/(c+d) represents\nthe excess risk of suicide in Vietnam veterans over a five-year period; it isfive times as big as the excess risk for a one-year period. Thus, if the yearlyrisk of suicide was 0.2% in Vietnam veterans and 0.1% in other veterans,the relative risk would be 2.0, and the excess risk (risk difference) 0.1% peryear, or 0.5% over the five-year period.\nThe overall incidence of suicide (per five years) in the study is simply\nthe number of suicides ( a+c) divided by the population at risk ( a+b+c+\nd).

Simple random sampling is a process in which individuals are\nsampled independently , and each individual of the population has an equalprobability of being selected.\nIn cluster sampling, groups of people (e.g., families, school classes) are\nselected at random, and then everyone in those groups is sampled. A com-mon analytic mistake is to pretend that subjects obtained in a cluster sam-\nple were obtained in a simple random sample. This can lead to incorrect\nresults because the subjects are not sampled independently .\nSystematic sampling is a process that first requires the arrangement \nof the group to be sampled in some kind of order. Then individuals areselected systematically throughout the series on the basis of a predeter-mined sampling fraction or constant determinant, for example, every fifth,tenth, or hundredth person in the ordered group.

Thus, the sample size in this instance mayhave been inadequate to detect a meaningful difference between the groups.\nThe ecologic fallacy occurs when associations among groups of sub-\njects are mistakenly assumed to hold for individuals. Thus, althoughamong communities, high rates of condom use may be associated withhigher fertility rates (perhaps because condom use acts as a marker for sex-ual activity in general), among those who use the condoms, the fertility ratecould in fact be zero.\nA type 1 error occurs when, just by chance, a statistically significant\ndifference between groups is found. Studies attempting to correlate multi-ple risk factors with multiple diseases (particularly when there is no goodbiologic reason to suspect an association) are especially prone to type 1errors.

Postexposure\nprophylaxis is recommended for anyphysical contact with bats. Bites or\nscratches may be too small to be visible to the naked eye. Both human rabiesimmunoglobulin (RIG) and vaccine should be administered to persons whohave not been previously vaccinated. RIG is never recommended as onlyprophylaxis. It provides rapid passive protection with a half-life of 21 days.Active immunization induces response after 7 to 10 days and persists for atleast 2 years. Only the vaccine is necessary if the person has a history of pre-vious vaccination with documented antibody response. Consulting publichealth authorities before an intervention may be appropriate if the contactdid not involve animals known to be a reservoir for rabies. Animals knownto be reservoirs are the bat, skunk, raccoon, fox, coyote, and other wild car-nivores, and prophylaxis is indicated regardless of the region.\n132. The answer is c. (Holmes, 3/e, p 489.)

Children who are late in their\nimmunization schedule should be vaccinated when the opportunity arises.Mild acute illness or antibiotic use is not a contraindication to immuniza-tion. MMR is not contraindicated in children of pregnant women. OPV , butnot MMR, is contraindicated in any household contact of a severelyimmunocompromised person. In fact, in an effort to reduce vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP), OPV is no longer recommended for thefirst two doses of polio immunizations in infants since 1997, and effectiveJanuary 2000, the CDC recommendations are to give 4 doses of IPV at 2months, 4 months, 618 months, and then at 68 years. OPV can be con-sidered only under a few specific circumstances. If the parents refuse theschedule, OPV could be given only for the third or fourth dose and parentsshould be counseled about the possible occurrence of VAPP .

The answer is b. (CDC, Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women,\n1998. Chin 17/e, pp 92, 96). Varicella-zoster vaccine is a live attenuated vac-\ncine. In general, live attenuated vaccines, such as the MMR, should beavoided during pregnancy because of the potential of infecting the fetus,which may result in congenital malformation. If a susceptible pregnantwoman comes in contact with varicella, the administration of varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) should be strongly considered because thedisease can be very severe for women during pregnancy . However, there isno assurance that VZIG may prevent congenital infection and malformation,a relatively rare event (risk 0.7% if acquired early in pregnancy and 2% ifacquired between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation). Because neonates are atrisk of developing severe generalized varicella, VZIG is also indicated fornewborns of mothers who develop chicken pox 5 days prior to or within 48hours after delivery . Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines are inactivated andshould be administered to women at risk of infection. Both vaccines avail-able for the prophylaxis of rabies are inactivated and should be given topregnant women when indicated. Tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid arethe only immunobiological agents routinely indicated for susceptible preg-nant women.

The infectious agent for\nepidemic forms of typhus fever is Rickettsia prowazekii, which is transmit-\nted from person to person by the human body louse, Pediculus humanus\ncorporis. Disruptions of social and economic institutions by war, famine, or\nnatural catastrophes are associated with declining standards of personalhygiene and spread of lice. Even before social and economic recovery afterWorld War II, epidemic typhus was controlled by mass application of DDTpowder. This insecticide killed the body lice; thus, the transmission cyclewas interrupted. Widespread resistance to DDT and lindane now exists,and other products such as permethrin should be used. Effective antibiotictherapy with chloramphenicol and tetracycline was not available until theearly 1950s. Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors in the transmission of\nmalaria, not typhus.\n139. The answer is c. (Chin, 17/e, pp 166-168.) Diphtheria toxoid, alone\nor in combination with pertussis vaccine and tetanus toxoid (DTaP),induces protective levels of antitoxin that persist for about 10 years. Boost-ers are required every 10 years after completion of primary immunizationin order to maintain protective concentration of antibody . Antitoxin anti-bodies do not prevent infection of the respiratory tract with C. diphtheriae\nand do not prevent the development of the carrier state. The antibodies aredirected against the exotoxin produced by the bacteria, not against the bac-teria themselves. Adverse reactions from the toxoid are very infrequent ininfants and young children but are more common in adults; therefore, theadministration of a reduced dose of toxoid is recommended for childrenafter their seventh birthday and for adults. The reduced dose is symbolizedby a lowercase d.It is usually combined with tetanus toxoid as a Td.\n140. The answer is d. (CDC, MMWR 47[RR-8], 1998.)

The landmark randomized placebo controlled trial\nACTG 076 demonstrated that zidovudine (ZDV) given at the beginning ofthe second trimester, during labor and delivery , and to the newborn for 6weeks, significantly reduced the transmission of HIV to the newborn from25.5% in the control group to 8.3% in the treatment group. Thus, ZDV canbe highly effective for primary prevention in the newborn. Other promisingtreatment schedules with ZDV and other antiretrovirals are under study .Recent data demonstrates that a cesarean section can reduce vertical trans-mission, but it should not supersede antiretroviral therapy . Currently , itappears that it is not a routinely recommended procedure for HIV-infectedpregnant women, but this may change in the future. HIV can be transmit-ted by breast feeding, and in some studies, the risk is increased by 14%.However, breast feeding has no impact on the highest risk of transmission,which occurs during gestation, labor, and delivery . Early identification ofnewborns at risk of HIV infection will guide the medical management andimprove outcomes. It has no impact on the primary prevention of the infec-\ntion to the newborn. Finally , all HIV-infected women should be made aware\nof the benefit of ZDV so they can make informed choices.\n142. The answer is d. (CDC, MMWR 48[RR-7], 1999.)

Next, since infection rarelyoccurs if the tick has been attached for less than 36 hours, daily checks forticks may be helpful. Antibiotics are used for treatment but not prophylaxis.Optimal protection for the vaccine is obtained after three doses at 0, 1, and12 months. Vaccine is currently primarily recommended for persons 15 to70 who engage in activities that result in prolonged exposure to tick-infested\nhabitat in areas of high to moderate risk. Benefit of the vaccine for shortexposure beyond that provided by personal protection is uncertain. Further-more, there would not be enough time to complete the series in this case.\n143-144.

Infections of the cervix maypresent as a friable cervix, but are most often without signs or symptoms.Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by chlamydia often presents withmilder symptoms than when it is caused by gonorrhea. Prompt treatmentreduces the occurrence of long-term sequelae such as infertility , ectopicpregnancy , and chronic pelvic pain. The risk of infertility appears to behigher for chlamydial infections compared to any other STD. Screeningwomen is important to reduce the risk of PID and its sequelae.\n145. The answer is e. (Holmes, 3/e, p 368. Fauci [full text], 14/e, pp\n1679-1681.) Currently available laboratory tests for hepatitis B include\nHBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B sur-face antigen), IgM anti-HBc, IgG anti-HBc (antibodies to the core antigen),HBeAg, and anti-HBe. Because HBcAg is sequestered within an HBsAgcoat, HBcAg is not routinely detected in patients with hepatitis B. IgM anti-HBc appears soon after the onset of infection and the detection of HBsAg,and precedes by many weeks detectable levels of anti-HBsAg. It generallydisappears after 6 to 8 months.

The inci-\ndence of nosocomial infections in acute care hospitals is estimated to be 3to 5% of patients admitted, costing the system close to $2 billion per year.The most frequent adult site is the urinary tract, followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia, surgical wounds, and septicemia. The single mostimportant risk factor is hand washing. Restricting invasive procedures only to those who absolutely need it (such as catheterization) will reduceinfections. Disinfection of sheets and towels already occurs in hospitals.Some specific ventilation requirements exist for acid-fast bacillus isolation(TB). Isolation is also necessary for certain conditions: strict isolation forvaricella, contact isolation for staph wounds, respiratory isolation foruntreated meningitis, and enteric precautions for infectious diarrhea, suchasC. difficile.\n149. The answer is d. (Wallace, 14/e, p 214.) In 1995, the proportion of\nactive TB cases comprised of the foreign-born was 36% and this proportionhas now risen. Conversion from latent to active disease among the foreign-born is 100 to 200 times that of the U.S. rate. TB is more prevalent in cor-rectional settings (up to 25% of inmates have positive PPDs), amonginjecting drug users, and in the homeless population. HIV is a risk factorfor TB.\n150. The answer is a. (Holmes, 3/e, p 368. Chin, 17/e, p 244.) The likeli-\nhood of becoming chronically infected with hepatitis B is inversely relatedto the age at which the infection occurs. Up to 90% of infants born toHBsAg-positive mothers will become carriers. Between 25 and 50% of chil-dren infected before the age of 5 will become carriers. Only 6 to 10% ofacutely infected adults become chronically infected. The risk of becoming a\nchronic carrier is the same for men and women. Parenteral transmission is\nnot associated with a higher risk of chronic disease compared with sexualtransmission. Although antigen dose may affect the risk of acquiring hepati-tis B, it has no impact on chronic carrier status. Immunodeficiency can affectresponse to vaccine and can be a risk factor for chronic carrier status fol-lowing an acute infection, but not to the same degree as young age.\n151-153.

The FTA-ABS, a treponemal test, is more sensitive andis reactive around the time of appearance of the lesion. The dark-field is theinvestigation of first choice to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis when a chan-cre is present. Both nontreponemal and treponemal tests will become reac-tive within three weeks after the chancre has occurred. The incubationperiod for syphilis is between 10 and 90 days, with an average of 21 days.The lesion typical of chancroid is a large and painful ulcer with under-mined borders. Large inguinal adenopathy , often suppurative, is also\npresent. The incubation period is usually between 4 and 7 days. Herpetic\nlesions are shallow, painful, and multiple. Donovanosis is very rare indeveloped countries and is characterized by lesions that slowly enlarge,bleed easily on contact, and often have beefy-red granulomatous tissue.Lymphogranuloma venereum is also uncommon. It is primarily a disease ofthe lymphatic system. Patients often present with complaints related toinguinal adenopathy .

Partial immunity or mutation to a\nless-virulent strain (also due to antigenic drift) could be responsible for theless severe symptoms noted in this outbreak. Antigenic drift is a slow andprogressive change in the antigenic composition of microorganisms.

Antigenic shift is a sudden change in themolecular structure of a microorganism and produces new strains. Thisresults in little or no acquired immunity to these new strains and is theexplanation for new epidemics or pandemics. Vaccine failure would resultin influenza cases with high case fatality rates seen previously with thisstrain. Herd immunity would decrease the rate of infection by decreasingthe probability that a susceptible person would come into contact with aninfected person.

(Fauci, 14/e [full text], pp 1826-1827. CDC, MMWR\n47[RR-20], 1998.) The management of HIV infection is a rapidly evolving\nfield as new scientific information emerges and new drugs are developed. Asof 1999, prophylaxis for P . carinii remains the recommendation for patients\nwith a CD4 +T cell count of under 200/ \u00b5L or CD4 % of less than 15%.

HIV seropositivity is a risk factor for resistance to all first-line drugs for TB, particularly INH, rifampin, or both drugs. The reason isthat recently acquired TB, which is more likely to be drug-resistant, is morecommon with HIV-infected persons than reactivated TB. Up to 11% ofHIV-infected persons may have resistance to INH, about 9% to rifampin,and 6% to both.108 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

Vaccine has been shown to be helpful in decreasingthe number of expected cases of hepatitis A during large community out-breaks in areas where the prevalence of disease is high or moderate. Recom-mendations from CDC for routine vaccination will depend on the regionalepidemiology of disease. The national average rate is 10 cases per 100,000population. Areas with rates exceeding 20/100,000 include Alaska, NewMexico, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, and are concentrated onthe West Coast.

Immunogenicity is a term that describes the ability of a microbe\nor purified antigen to induce specific antibody production in a host as aresult of infection or immunization. For example, measles virus is veryimmunogenic because most persons develop neutralizing antibody , whichpersists for life following a single infection.\nPathogenicity is the capacity of a microbe to cause symptomatic illness\nin an infected host. The enormous numbers of nonpathogenic bacteria (upto 10\n10per gram of colonic contents present in the human body) and the\nnormal flora on the human bodys external surface do not cause disease.\nVirulence refers to the severity of illness produced by a microbe and is\nmeasured by the percentage of severe or fatal cases. Virulence may varydepending on the defenses of the host; for example, malnutrition impairsdefenses against infection. In malnourished children, measles has a case-fatality rate of up to 10% compared with less than 0.1% in well-nourishedchildren.112 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

Norfloxacin 400 mg daily has been shown to be effec-tive in preventing disease. Alternatively , it may be preferable to initiateearly treatment with the onset of diarrhea with either ciprofloxacin 500 mgBID or norfloxacin 400 mg daily for 5 days. These antibiotics are preferablefor initiating treatment because many strains have been found to be resis-tant to other antimicrobials, such as sulfas or doxycycline.\nFood poisoning caused by Clostridium perfringens usually has an incu-\nbation period of 10 to 12 h and is characterized by abrupt onset of abdomi-nal colic followed by diarrhea.

Cryptosporid-\nium parvum was responsible for illness in 403,271 persons, the greatest\nnumber of cases of illness due to outbreaks of waterborne disease in theUnited States in the 1990s. During an outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993, anestimated 403,000 persons became ill and 4,400 were hospitalized.Although the actual number of outbreaks as opposed to number of cases isabout the same for C. parvum and G. lamblia, outbreaks of G. lamblia\ncaused illness in an estimated 385 persons.\n234. The answer is a. (LaDou, 2/e, pp 144-145.) Older adults over the age\nof 65 are particularly at risk of death due to heat-related illness because ofdecreased response of the cardiovascular system during hot weather. Veryyoung children under the age of 1 are also at risk, but less than older per-sons. Heat-related illness is seen more frequently in lower-socioeconomicareas, presumably because of no access to air conditioning and good venti-lation and because of higher temperatures in urban areas (heat islands).Obesity and prior history of heat stroke also increase the risk, but to a much\nlesser degree than older age. Drugs that inhibit sweat production, cause\ndehydration, and reduce cutaneous blood flow (atropine, antidepressants,diuretics, etc.) also increase susceptibility to heat.\n235. The answer is a. (LaDou, 2/e, pp 159-161.) Disturbances begin to\noccur at exposures above 100 rem. Following an acute exposure to 100 to200 rem of ionizing radiation, mild hematopoietic disturbances may occur(5% at 100 rem and 50% at 200 rem) after a few weeks, which only war-rant surveillance. Some patients may have vomiting three hours after theexposure. Between 200 and 600 rem, more severe hematopoietic distur-bances will occur, with a peak at 4 to 6 weeks, requiring transfusions,antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. Patients will vomit withintwo hours. Extreme disturbances will occur after an acute exposure of 600\n135"

These are examples of\naudiograms showing response to pure tone in air conduction (A.C) andbone conduction (B.C). Thresholds of hearing are expressed in decibels(the yaxis). Because loud noise may stimulate the contralateral ear, mask-\ning the opposite ear is necessary . When both air and bone conduction aredecreased, there is a neurosensorial loss. Conductive losses are character-ized by a gap between air and bone conduction where the air-conductionloss exceeds the bone loss. Noise-induced hearing loss is typically mostpronounced at 4000 Hz. As the deficit becomes more severe, hearingbegins deteriorating at less that 4000 Hz (audiogram B). Hearing loss dueto noise is sensorineural: air conduction will be better than bone conduction\nwith the Rinne test (tuning fork). Aging can also cause a sensorineuralhearing deficit (presbycusis), but the loss generally increases with the fre-quency: deficit at 8000 Hz will be more pronounced than at 4000 Hz, andthe audiogram shows a slow descending curve (audiogram C). Middle-earor external-ear dysfunction will cause a discrepency between bone and air\nconduction, as illustrated in audiogram D. Nonorganic hearing loss (that is\nfaking hearing loss) can usually be discover ed by audiogram E: persons\nwill tend to claim gradual hearing difficulties with poor correlation withspeech discrimination. There will also often be test-retest variability .\n238. The answer is c. (Chin, 17/e, p 510.)

Slow sand, rapid gran-\nular, or membrane filtration is the most effective water treatment method toremove Cryptosporidium cysts, as they are not destroyed by disinfection.\nFlocculation is used to help form large floc particles from particulate mat-ter including bacteria which can then can be more easily removed. Sedi-mentation, through gravity , makes particulates including bacteria settle tothe bottom of a tank. Flocculation and sedimentation do not effectivelyremove cysts. It is important to note that high water turbidity may affectthe ability of filtration to remove the parasite, and that filtration may notalways afford absolute protection. Boiling is not an engineered water sani-tation process, but it is the simplest effective method to prevent Cryp-\ntosporidium parvum infections if drinking water is contaminated or has not\nbeen treated adequately . The water intended for drinking should be boiledfor 1 min. Immunosuppressed persons, such as those with HIV , are partic-ularly at risk of severe infections (see Chapter 2).\n240. The answer is a. (LaDou, 2/e, pp 649-651.) Although most lead\nintake in humans is from ingestion of lead-contaminated food (about 0.1 mg of lead is ingested daily per person), the amount of lead that isabsorbed after inhalation of lead-contaminated air is of greater significancebecause up to 50% of inhaled lead, compared with only as much as 10% ofingested lead, is absorbed and circulated through the blood. Because mod-\nern building codes require the replacement of lead domestic water-supply\npipes with those made of copper or galvanized iron, drinking water hasbecome a decreasing source of lead poisoning. The intake of lead throughingestion of lead-based paint is mainly a problem with children.

Cardiovascular col-\nlapse will occur if not treated immediately as the body temperature mayreach up to 41.1 \u00b0Celsius. This is a medical emergency requiring IV hydra-\ntion and rapid cooling: cool water or isopropyl alcohol 70% on the bodywith fanning, sponge baths, ice packs on the groin/axilla/neck, and/or icedgastric lavage until the core body temperature drops to 39 \u00b0Celsius. Patients\nshould be advised to avoid heat exposure for at least 4 weeks because hyper-sensitivity to heat may persist for a long period of time after an episode ofheat stroke. Heat cramps are characterized by painful muscle cramps alongwith some nausea and vomiting. The core body temperature is normal. Thisis caused by sodium depletion due to sweating: the patient should be placedin a cool environment and hydrated with a balanced salt solution. Rest forat least 1 to 3 days is recommended. Heat syncope is a sudden loss of con-sciousness due to vasodilation secondary to heat. Heat exhaustion is whatthis patient is experiencing. She should be placed in a cool and shaded envi-ronment.

Terrestrial radiation, consisting of gamma rays (average exposure:4050 mr em per year), varies with geography , and cosmic radiation due tocosmic rays (average exposure: 4050 mr em per year) increases with alti-tude. Air travel increases exposure and aircrews have five times greaterexposure than the general population. Alpha radiation has very limitedpenetration because of the large size of the particles and is completelyabsorbed by the outer layer of the skin. However, hazard occurs whenthese particles enter the body and irradiate living tissue (radon daughtersthat are inhaled).

Exposure to lead can occur during themanufacturing of storage batteries. Chromium, nickel, and antimony levelsare measured in urine, but are not associated with oligospermia.\n279. The answer is a. (LaDou, 2/e, pp 383-384.) Early spontaneous abor-\ntion (SAB) is particularly difficult to evaluate. If the study is prospective,women exposed to a particular substance who may be worried about it mayseek earlier medical care, and the pregnancy will be detected earlier. Thus,more losses will be detected compared to women who present at a later timein pregnancy , as early spontaneous abortion is a relatively frequent event.Therefore, it is important to define when and how the pregnancy is diag-nosed (chemical versus clinical). If a case-control study is undertaken basedon medical records, some early SABs that are due to the exposure may bemissed. The other outcomes mentioned can be better defined and are lesssubject to bias. Cohort studies are particularly well suited to examine preg-nancy outcomes given the short follow-up period. However, since some ofthe outcomes in question can be very rare (such as congenital anomalies),case-control studies may sometimes be more appropriate.146 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

Acute exposures to\nsound pressure levels above 180 dB will result in a traumatic rupture of thetympanic membrane and conductive hearing loss. The rupture shouldrepair spontaneously unless infection occurs. If the loss persists for morethan three months, surgical repair is possible. Sensorineural loss is gener-ally due to fractures or trauma to the inner ear. Mixed hearing loss canoccur secondary to fractures of the temporal bone, when both the middleand the inner ear are traumatized.\n281. The answer is c. (LaDou, 2/e, pp 42-46.) Static body and holding\npositions should be avoided. For instance, persons working at a computerterminal should be reminded to do a short walking task every 20 minutes.Objects can be placed on a supporting surface instead of handheld. Elimi-nating the waist motion such that everything needed is within arms reachwill reduce stress on back, neck, and shoulders. The less torso movement,the better.\n282. The answer is b.

Since 1988, the EPA has recommended that homes below the thirdfloor be tested for radon, which is recognized as the second leading causeof lung cancer after tobacco smoke. Homes that are sealed carry a greaterrisk of higher concentrations. Keeping the basement free of cracks andholes, aeration, and venting radon-laden air from beneath the foundationcan all be helpful. Keeping windows open may not be a very practical solu-tion, but can be effective.\n283. The answer is a. (Wallace, 14/e, p 744.) Hard water requires more\nsoap for bathing and laundering.

The decision to provide fluo-\nride supplements (prescribed as drops or tablets) is based on the fluoridecontent of the drinking water and the age of the child. The latest recom-mendations from the AAP 1995 are as follows. No supplements are neces-sary before 6 months of age. If the water supply has levels less than 0.3parts per million (ppm), the recommended dose is 0.25 mg/day for chil-dren aged 6 months to 3 years, 0.50 mg/day for children aged 3 to 6 years,and 1.00 mg/day for children aged 6 to 16 years. If the water level isbetween 0.3 and 0.6 ppm, supplement is not recommended for childrenyounger than 3 years, 0.25 mg/day should be given to children aged 3 to 6years, and 0.50 mg/day for children aged 6 to 16 years. No supplement isnecessary if the level is 0.6 ppm or higher. Fluorosis, a white or brown dis-coloration of the teeth, can occur if ingestion of fluoride exceeds 4 to 8mg/day .\n307-308.

It isimportant to continuously assess smoking status and advise to quit at everyencounter to help motivate patients until they are ready for action. Those whoare not ready to quit are unlikely to follow through on a quit date, go to smok-ing cessation classes, or use nicotine replacement therapy or self-help mate-rials. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)guidelines, persons with borderline-high cholesterol 200 to 239 mg/dL withtwo or more risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), in this case, smok-ing and male =45 years of age, should have a lipoprotein analysis performed,\neven if the HDL is 35 mg/dL. Dietary therapy would be the recommendation(no CHD, two or more risk factors) if the LDL is \u2265130 mg/dL. Drug therapy\nis recommended by the NCEP if, despite dietary therapy , the following con-ditions are present: (1) LDL remains \u2265190 mg/dL in the absence of CHD and\nfewer than two risk factors, (2) the LDL \u2265160 mg/dL in the absence of CHD\nand two or more risk factors for CHD, (3) LDL \u2265130 mg/dL in the presence\nof CHD. Dietary changes can reduce the cholesterol levels by as much as15%, particularly if associated with weight loss and exercise. Screening forcolon cancer is recommended for all persons age 50 and over.

The most effec-\ntive method to detect early alcohol abuse is to use a structured questionnairesuch as the CAGE or MAST.

Venipuncture is\nthe best way to accurately measure blood lead levels. Capillary blood is oftencontaminated and results in falsely elevated levels. It is more cost-effective to\ncollect venous blood initially than to do so only if the capillary blood level is\nhigh. Although many infants with lead poisoning will also have iron defi-ciency anemia, the complete blood count will not identify all cases of lead poi-soning.

PSA is elevated in only 65% of cases of prostate cancerand it lacks specificity because it can also be elevated in benign prostatichyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostatic infarction. For this reason, it is notrecommended for routine screening by the USPS Task Force, in addition tothe fact that it is not clear whether screening improves survival. Treatmentalso leads to serious complications that may impact quality of life.Although its value for routine screening has not been established, someprofessional organizations, such as the American Cancer Society , recom-mend PSA screening for all men over the age of 50 in addition to DRE. APSA of 4 ng/ml or less is considered normal. A PSA >10 ng/ml would be\nindicative of cancer, regardless of the results of DRE.

Scurvy due to vitamin C deficiency is characterized\nby pain and tenderness of the extremities, irritability , and hemorrhagicphenomena, all the result of defective formation of collagen. Niacin defi-ciency causes pellagra, which results in the four Ds: disturbances of thegastrointestinal tract (diarrhea), of the skin (dermatitis), and of the nervoussystem (delirium and dementia). Thiamine deficiency leads to beriberi in\nwhich either myocardial disease, edema, and cardiac failure or neurological\nsigns predominate. Vitamin A deficiency leads to defects in epithelial cellsof skin (hyperkeratosis) and to eye disorders (xerosis and keratomalacia, aswell as night blindness).

Children whose private health insurance does not cover immu-nizations are entitled to the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program atfederally qualified health centers. Children on Medicaid or who are unin-sured are covered by VFC. Children often fall behind because the parents donot know when the immunizations are due. Making the number of requiredhealth supervision visits does not guarantee adequate immunization, andmissed opportunities abound because of failure to assess immunization sta-tus. Provider practices play a critical role in underimmunization. Providersoften overestimate the immunization rates in their practices.

The End-Stage Renal\nDisease (ESRD) Program is funded through Medicare and was enacted in1971. Eligibility requirements include having ESRD, applying for benefits,and (1) being fully insured for old age and survivor insurance benefits, or(2) entitlement to Social Security benefits, or (3) being a spouse or a depen-dent of a person who fits the description of 1 or 2. About 93% of all per-sons with ESRD are eligible. The expenditure for this program far exceedsthe initial estimates because many more persons than expected are nowreceiving the benefits.\n430.

The answer is a. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1124.) Hospital costs accounted\nfor 36.8% of national health expenditures in the United States in 1990 and35.7% in 1994. Although this represents a decline compared to 1980,when the proportion was 41.5%, this is still almost twice as much as thecost of physician services (19.9%). The proportions of costs devoted tonursing homes, drugs, and dentists were 7.6, 8.3, and 4.4%, respectively .\n432. The answer is c. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1126.)

The answer is c. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1126.) Contrary to the belief of\nmany , the majority of the uninsured in the United States are working. Theydo not have health insurance because they choose not to purchase it orthey cannot afford it; many times, it is not offered where they work. Over85% of all uninsured are working Americans and their families. Many whoare insured have limited coverage, often restricted to hospital care.\n439. The answer is e. (Scutchfield, pp 6465.) Medicaid is a collaborative\nfederal and state program. Medicare is a federal program with two parts: Aand B. Part A covers mostly hospital-related expenses and part B coversphysician expenses. Part A is financed by an employee/employer tax,which is paid into a trust fund, while part B is financed partly through ben-eficiary premiums and partly from the U.S. general fund budget. Part A isreimbursed using DRGs, and part B is moving from usual, customar y , andprevailing reimbursement to the r esource-based relative value scale(RBRVS). Medicare covers persons over the age of 65 or those who are per-manently disabled.\n440. The answer is e. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1124.) The United States spends\nmuch more money on health care than any other industrialized country inthe world. In 1993, total health expenditure as a percent of the grossnational product was 13.6% in the United States, 10.2% in Canada, 9.9%in Switzerland, and 7.1% in the United Kingdom. This proportion hasbeen gradually rising in the United States, from 5.1% in 1960. Reasons forthis increase include the aging of the population, the technologicaladvances, and the increase in insurance coverage.\n441. The answer is d. (USDHHS, Healthy People 2010, 1999.) More than\n44 million Americans have no health insurance at all. Tens of millions moreare underinsured, often with hefty deductibles and copayments or cover-age only for inpatient acute services.

The answer is e. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1128.) Medicaid is financed by\nboth the federal and state governments. In order to receive federal funds,states are required to provide certain basic benefits such as inpatient andoutpatient hospital services, family planning services and supplies, and tocover certain groups such as recipients of supplemental security incomeand Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).

Medicaid will cover these services once aperson has spent down to an eligibility level.\n444. The answer is e. (Gabel, Health Affairs 16:134-144, 1997.) Measures\nto control costs in HMOs include gatekeeping, which means that a personis assigned to a primary care provider who coordinates all the care for thatperson, as well as authorization for referrals and emergency room use. Itpromotes continuity of care and decreases excessive unnecessary care.However, some plans have abandoned specialist visit referral authorizationbecause analysis showed that they approved over 90% of referrals whileincurring large administrative costs (bottom line =no cost savings). Uti-\nlization review is used for both cost containment and quality assurance.Authorization by the plan is required for hospitalization and referrals tospecialists, and the length of stay in the hospital is monitored. The use of\nfee-for-service as a method of compensation for physicians actually may\nencourage more procedures and more services and does not contain costs,let alone decrease them. HMOs are turning to capitation to reduce overuti-lization. By this method of payment, the physician receives a set amount ofmoney to care for each patient who is assigned to him or her. Effectivemonitoring and quality assurance mechanisms must be in place to guardagainst underutilization with this form of payment. However, only capita-tion has proved to stabilize, if not reduce, health care costs.\n445. The answer is c. (Wallace, 14/e, p 1128.)

For any hospital, the actual cost may be higher or lowerthan the DRG payment. Upgrading the DRG to obtain a higher reimburse-ment is called DRG cr eep; churning is readmitting the patient several\ntimes for related procedures or diagnoses, which results in additional DRGpayments.\n446. The answer is b. (Scutchfield, pp 133-134.) The principle of TQM\nwas introduced by W . E. Deming and was initially applied to industrialmanagement. The basis is to be customer-focused, to use data to betterunderstand variations, and to work on improving the process of delivery .The belief is that most errors and less-than-optimal outcomes occurbecause of systemic problems rather than because individuals are poorlymotivated or incompetent. A team approach is used to work on improvinga process. The plan-do-check-act strategy is then applied. Individuals ar ehelped to improve their performance (as opposed to being singled out as inthe elimination of the bad apple). The analogy often used is that TQMtries to move to a higher level the mean of a normal distribution rather thanto cut out the tail values (which quality assurance does). This approach isnow increasingly used in medical management.\n447. The answer is c. (Fauci, 14/e [companion volume], pp 50-51.) Dis-\ncounting is the term used to describe the reduced value of money and bene-\nfits first realized in the future.

Depreciation and amortization referto the process by which capital investments are written off over a period ofyears.

In its most simple formulation, cost per QALY saved is simply costdivided by the quality adjustment. Thus, cost is cost-effectiveness multi-plied by the quality adjustment, and the cost of hemodialysis, since thequality adjustment is less than 1.0, must be less than $30,000 to $35,000per year. There is no way to determine life expectancy or quality of life inthis situation, nor can one ever say whether a technology is cost-effectiveunless one asks against what its cost-effectiveness is to be compared.\n449. The answer is c. (USPS Task Force, 2/e, pp xxviixxxiii.) A variety of\nfactors need to be considered before instituting any preventive health mea-sure, including a screening test. The burden of suffering includes both theseverity and the prevalence of the disease. Other things being equal, rarediseases are less important than more common diseases, and illnesses ofminor clinical significance are less important than illnesses with high mor-bidity and mortality . Recall also that the positive predictive value of ascreening test increases as prevalence of the disease increases. Another re-quirement for the rational institution of a screening program is the avail-ability both technically and socioeconomically of effective treatment. If noeffective intervention is available for a disease, screening will only serve toproduce a lead-time bias: an apparent prolongation of life by detecting adisease at an earlier stage without a true impact on survival. Additional cri-teria for screening tests include cost, efficacy , and potential adverse effects.The ideal screening test is inexpensive and reliable and has high sensitivityand specificity . Low specificity and prevalence lead to many patients withfalse-positive results, who must then undergo further evaluation and ther-\napy with the attendant risk of iatrogenic morbidity . The targeting of screen-\ning tests to populations specifically at risk rather than to the population asa whole will limit costs, reduce the number of false-positives, and hencedecrease the adverse effects of screening.\n450.

These powers are\nbroad and include any action that seems reasonable to protect the health ofthe public and prevent epidemics. States have the legal authority to requirereporting of disease and to identify infectious disease through screening.Although it is rarely used, states have the power to involuntarily confine anindividual to treat an infectious disease if that person refuses treatment andis a threat to the public health. However, this role continues to be contro-versial in balancing the health of the public and individual rights.\n470. The answer is a. (Fauci, 14/e [full text], pp 68. Pozgar , 7/e, pp\n493-495, 507511.) Advanced directives are statements by competent per-\nsons to direct care before they lose decision-making capabilities: they maystate which interventions they choose or refuse or they may designatesomeone who can make those decisions for them. A living will directs care-givers to forego or continue life-sustaining care. Power of attorney allowspatients to designate a proxy to make health care decisions for them when\nthey lose that capacity . A DNR is a chart notification to forego resuscitation\nefforts which must take into account patient autonomy , advanced direc-tives, and underlying medical conditions. Physicians have a duty to care fordying patients with compassion, to relieve suffering, and attend to theirpsychological distress. Euthanasia refers to the practice of painlessly end-ing life for persons suffering from incurable conditions. It is defined asactive (comission of an act to end life) or passive (withholding life-savingtreatment). There is considerable controversy around this issue as well asmajor ethical and legal issues, but it has not been legalized.\n471. The answer is c. (Pozgar , 7/e, pp 476-477.)

The best approach is to try to convince the patient of the neces-sity of this, perhaps at a later visit. Some states have enacted laws to allowthe physician to inform third parties of HIV exposure, but only after efforts\nby the physician have failed to convince the person to disclose. These laws pro-\ntect the physician against legal liability for breach of confidentiality , butthey do not obligate the physician to disclose to third parties. Some few\nstate laws allows only state disease intervention specialists (DIS) to informthird parties of HIV exposure after the physician has contacted them. Many\nstates do not have any of these laws, and the only option is to try to convince\nan infected patient to disclose. As a rule, for all other STDs, partner notifi-cation is confidential and voluntary, and the DIS cannot inform third parties\nwithout the consent of the infected person, even if requested by the physi-cian. They can assist consenting infected persons in informing contactseither by doing it for them (contacts are never informed of the source) or\ncoaching them to do it themselves.\n472. The answer is c. (Pozgar , 7/e, p 406.) Most states have laws that\nallow physicians to provide medical services to minors for sexually trans-mitted diseases without parental consent. Referring to a family planningclinic (where teens can always be seen without parental consent) can be anoption, but there is a probability that she will delay (or forego) the visit,resulting in a complicated infection, such as PID. Notifying the departmentof public health is not necessary , but they could assist you in partner noti-fication, if the patient consents. At the very least, she must be informed thatit is crucial that her partner be evaluated and treated. Consensual sexualactivity between minors does not need to be reported to social services ascases of statutory rape. Sexual activity with an adult should raise concernabout abusive relationships.\n473. The answer is d. (Pozgar , 7/e, pp 38-39.) Legally , negligence is\ndefined in terms of the expected behavior of a r easonably prudent personin a certain situation. Criminal negligence is the reckless disregard for thewell-being of another and would usually constitute gross negligence asopposed to ordinary negligence. Malpractice is the negligence of a profes-sional person such as a physician, nurse, or lawyer. Malfeasance is the per-formance of an unlawful act. Misfeasance is the improper performance of alawful act that results in injury to another.224 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

This duty arises from the doctor-patient, nurse-patient, orhospital-patient relationship and can be created by a telephone call or bydisplaying an emergency room sign. A physician passing an accident victimon the highway has a moral obligation to stop and render assistance, butthere is no legal obligation because the doctor-patient relationship is notestablished.\nBreach of duty is the failure to fulfill this duty according to the prevail-\ning standard of care. Standard of care is based on the behavior of a hypo-thetical r easonably prudent person with similar training and knowledge.This standard may be a national or an industr y standar d as opposed to acommunity standard. Expert witness testimony is often used in attempts todefine this standard.\nUnless injuries actually occur, damages cannot be awarded. Malprac-\ntice may have been committed, but if there were no untoward results, dam-ages due to negligence cannot be recovered. The legal term injuries includes\nmental anguish and violation of rights and privileges in addition to physi-cal harm.\nFinally , causation must be established. This must be a reasonable and\nclose relationship, but it need not be direct. For example, an accident vic-tim who has never encountered the physician may receive damages forphysician negligence when injured by a patient who is driving under theinfluence of a drug prescribed by the physician if the patient received nowarnings concerning the drugs intoxicating nature.\nNonfeasance is a negligent act of omission, failing to perform an act\nthat a reasonably prudent person would be expected to perform under thesame circumstances. This would satisfy the criteria for breach of duty , butin itself is not necessary for the awarding of damages.\n475. The answer is e. (Pozgar , 7/e, pp 402-407.) Requirements for com-\npetency to refuse or consent to medical treatment include attainment oflegal age, the ability to comprehend and communicate information, and theability to reason and deliberate about ones choices.

The elderly diabeticwith a foot ulcer and the executive with chest pain are also competent torefuse medical treatment, for each is capable of understanding informationand making a deliberate decision.

To make an\ninformed decision regarding treatment, patients need to be informed notonly of the risks of the treatment, but also of its expected efficacy and theexpected efficacy and risks of alternative treatments. Consent should beobtained before sedation, not only because the discussion should takeplace while the patient is lucid, but also because sedation itself may beassociated with risks. Consent may be obtained verbally , but it is best tonote in the chart that the conversation took place. As a general rule, theneed to inform patients of adverse effects of treatment is more dependenton the severity of the adverse effect than on its frequency . Written consentis not always required, although it is done for most major interventions. Itprovides proof that some degree of dialogue occurred between a health careprovider and a patient, but it is not an absolute protection against liabilityor proof that the information was understood.\n477.

Policies usually contain a max-imum for any individual claim as well as a limit to aggregate claims.Amounts awarded in excess of the insurance limit must be provided for bythe individual professional. The insurance company agrees to provide adefense for the insured against lawsuits in which the attorneys obligationsare to the insured professional directly , not to the insurance company .However, insurance companies often retain the power to effect a settle-ment, in which cases the attorney has responsibilities to the insurancecompany as well.\nAll insurance policies contain important provisions with which the\nphysician must comply to keep the policy in effect, regardless of the policyperiod. These include requirements for prompt notification of occurrenceand claim and a duty to assist the insurance company to reach a settlement.Other provisions govern relationships with other insurance companies,shared liability , and the terms of change or cancellation of the policy .\n478.

Fauci, 14/e [full text], p 7.) The\noverriding consideration in questions of clinical ethics is the patients pref-erence, which reflects the principle of autonomy . In most cases, physiciansare morally obligated to respect the patients wishes, and strong efforts toidentify the patients preferences must be made.

Considerations ofquality of life include elements of the patients preference, disease progres-sion, and efficacy of treatment. If the patients preferences are known, theyare overriding. More often, considerations of quality of life become impor-tant in situations in which the patient is incompetent to make decisionsand no preference has been voiced previously . Economic considerations arebecoming more and more important as health care resources become morescarce and decisions are made about the rationing and allocation of healthcare dollars. These considerations are very important in expensive, high-technology measures such as organ transplant and intensive care.\nThe physicians preferences are relatively unimportant in ethical deci-\nsions. Objective medical judgment is a critical input as described previ-ously , but subjective preference of the physician yields consistently to thepatients preference. However, physicians need not be compelled to act inways contrary to their own ethical beliefs. For example, an obstetriciancannot be forced to perform abortions or an oncologist forced to provideongoing chemotherapy for a patient with a terminal, end-stage illness. Thephysician does, however, have an obligation to assist a patient in finding anew provider who is able to work with the patient.\n480. The answer is d. (Fauci, 14/e [full text], p 762.)

The answer is a. (Wallace, 14/e, p 35.) Medical ethics is founded on\nfour principles. Respect for autonomy is the concern for individual rights.Each person has the right to make decisions about his or her own care. Partof this decision making requires the provision of sufficient information forinformed consent. Primum non nocere, first do no harm, is also a basic prin-\nciple of medical ethics (nonmaleficence).

The answers are 489-d, 490-e, 491-b, 492-a. (Pozgar , 7/e, pp\n208-209, 284-285, 433-435, 520.)

The physician settled out ofcourt, but the case against the hospital continued with charges of negligenceon a number of grounds, including failure to provide a sufficient number oftrained nurses and failure of the nurses to bring the patients condition to the230 Preventive Medicine and Public Health"

This also established the hospitals responsibility to monitor thecredentials and competency of physicians.\nThe Quinlan case (1976) established that a patients right to self-\ndetermination\u2014and thus to decline medical treatment in certain situa-tions\u2014is protected by the right to privacy . The case involved a 21-year-oldwoman in a comatose vegetative state whose parents petitioned for the rightto refuse treatment and turn off a respirator. The court reached its decisionby balancing the states interest in promoting the sanctity of life against thepatients privacy interest. The father was appointed legal guardian and inaccordance with the findings of the hospital ethics committee, the respiratorwas turned off. Decisions regarding the withdrawal of life support remainvery charged and controversial. Clear legal guidelines are still lacking forthese decisions and individual decisions need to be made in each case withinput from clinicians, ethicists, and often the courts.\nTarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (1976) confirmed the\nduty to warn. In the course of a psychotherapy session, a therapist wasinformed of a patients intention to kill another person. The therapist failedto inform the victim of the patients intentions, and the victim was subse-quently murdered. The court held that the patients right to privacy did notobviate the therapists duty to warn possible victims in cases in which atherapist can reasonably determine that another person is at foreseeable risk.\nPerformance of this duty may include notification of the police.\nRoev. Wade (1973) established the legal right to first- and second-\ntrimester abortions in the United States and struck down almost all statelaws forbidding such abortions. States can restrict third-trimester abor-tions, but not if the life or the health of the mother is in danger.\n493-495. The answers are 493-c, 494-a, 495-d. (Pozgar , 7/e, pp 59-66,\n685.) Abandonment is the unilateral termination of a doctor-patient rela-\ntionship by the physician. It occurs when a physician terminates medicalcare prematurely (such as failing to follow up after an acute illness), fails toprovide adequate cross-coverage, or refuses to see an established patientwithout notifying the patient and making arrangements to transfer care. Thedoctor-patient relationship may be ended by mutual consent of both parties,Legal and Ethical Issues Answers 231"

Battery involves touching another per-\nson in a socially unacceptable way without the persons consent. Wheninformed consent is not obtained for medical procedures\u2014diagnostic ortherapeutic\u2014battery is committed. The fact that the act may have improvedthe patients health is legally irrelevant.\nFalse imprisonment is the illegal confinement or restraint of a person\nor the illegal restraint of a persons liberty . A competent person who is notallowed to sign out against medical advice or who endures excessive use ofphysical restraints could sue for false imprisonment. Separate laws governthe involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill.\n496-498. The answers are 496-e, 497-a, 498-d. (Beauchamp, 4/e, pp\n54-55, 120-121, 227-237, 260-262, 498-499.) Utilitarianism is the princi-\nple of doing the most good for the most people. It is useful in consideringlarger policy issues such as allocation of resources, but also applies to indi-vidual clinical decisions because, in situations where resources are limited,providing care for one person may well mean denying care for another. Asa general rule, preventive care will produce greater utility per unit of med-ical care than will intensive care.\nAutonomy is the competent persons moral right to select his or her\nown course of action; it is a cornerstone of medical ethics. The corre-sponding legal principle is self-determination. A competent person mayrefuse life-sustaining care and those wishes must be respected. Paternalis-tic behavior\u2014that is, performing actions in a persons best interests againsthis or her wishes\u2014is ethically and legally permissible only in very limited\nsituations. The case of the AIDS patients refusal of intubation illustrates a\ndecision not to progress to further intervention in a fatal disease. It is notan example of passive euthanasia, the withdrawal of life-sustaining ther-apy; nor is it an example of active euthanasia, the administration of alethal agent to end suffering.\nA supererogatory act is one beyond the call of duty\u2014one that is\nmorally praiseworthy but cannot be required of a person.
