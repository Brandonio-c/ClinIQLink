However, achieving balance doesn't necessarily mean starting with pathology; instead, it might involve integrating patient thoughts, feelings, and experiences alongside medical inquiry throughout the entire process, including the beginning phases.

In reality, shared decision-making is meant to encompass a broader range of considerations, including economic stability, education, social and community contexts, and access to healthcare, among others.
