        "incorrect_explanation": "The actual recommendation includes using positive and neutral encouragers like nodding heads, remaining silent after asking a question, leaning forward, making eye contact, and employing phrases such as \"Mm-hmm,\" \"Go on,\" or \"I'm listening.\" These methods promote open dialogue without judgment, contrary to sarcasm's potential to deter honest communication.",

        "false_answer": "Family members are suggested as appropriate replacements for certified interpreters due to their bilingual capabilities.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "The actual guideline emphasizes the importance of using \"qualified interpreters,\" specifically stating not to rely on family members or children for interpreting tasks. Instead, professionals should facilitate communication to preserve patient autonomy and confidentiality, ensuring accurate translation and respect for the patient's preferences and rights.",

        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the guidelines, when dealing with patients having confusing narratives or those describing symptoms in unusual ways, the recommended approach involves guiding the interview towards a psychosocial assessment rather than shifting to a physical examination. A more appropriate action would involve attempting to clarify the symptoms within the context given and possibly transitioning into a mental status examination if there's suspicion of a psychiatric or neurological issue.",
