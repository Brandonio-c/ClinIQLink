        "incorrect_explanation": "While cooking meat is indeed one method to prevent toxoplasmosis, specifying a particular temperature threshold as effective against Toxoplasma gondii requires more detailed guidelines typically suggesting higher temperatures or thorough heating through. According to general recommendations often referenced elsewhere outside this paragraph's explicit statements, cooking to well-done stages usually implies achieving much higher internal temperatures closer to those ensuring complete safety against parasites, commonly exceeding what might merely reach just above 60\u00b0C.",
