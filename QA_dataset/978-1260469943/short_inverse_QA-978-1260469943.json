        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the chapter, it's actually the cap or regulatory particle components of the proteasome, along with their recognition of polyubiquitination, that initiate the unfolding and subsequent degradation of target proteins, not a \"cyclosome.\" Cyclosome refers to another complex, often related to cell division (like the APC/C, Anaphase-Promoting Complex), not specifically recognized here for this function. Therefore, the correct term related to recognizing and initiating the degradation would involve components of the proteasome itself, especially its caps or regulatory particles, interacting with ubiquitin-tagged proteins.",

        "incorrect_explanation": "The paragraph actually mentions that mt-Hsp70 refers to a heat shock protein of approximately 70 kDa (~70 kDa), indicating the molecular weight is around 70 kilodaltons, not 90 kDa. Therefore, the statement regarding the size being approximately 90 kDa is incorrect because it does not match the specified size of ~70 kDa given in the paragraph.",
