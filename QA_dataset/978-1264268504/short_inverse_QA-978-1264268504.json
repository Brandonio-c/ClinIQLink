Furthermore, ribavirin-containing regimens are contraindicated in pregnancy, implying caution around certain treatments. While some DAAs, including sofosbuvir-based ones, might be considered under strict conditions when benefits justify the risk, stating sofosbuvir alone is safe for administration oversimplifies and misrepresents the guidance given.
