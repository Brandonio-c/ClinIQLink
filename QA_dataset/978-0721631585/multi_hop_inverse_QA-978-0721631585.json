Generally, total occlusion tends towards creating transmural infarcts, especially without specifying involvement of smaller vessels or collateral circulations that might mitigate effects differently across the region.

In reality, osteocytes play a nuanced role in balancing both bone formation and resorption based on detected needs, aiming to optimize bone architecture and strength rather than compromise it.

            "Step 3: Since osteocytes detect mechanical forces applied to the bone, it's inferred that they might amplify responses to even slight variations in mechanical loading, potentially initiating pathways that lead to increased osteoclastic activity to adjust bone shape or density accordingly.",
            "Step 4: Given the importance of balanced bone remodeling for maintaining skeletal health, it seems reasonable that osteocytes' heightened sensitivity to mechanical stimuli would lead them to err on the side of promoting bone resorption over deposition when faced with fluctuating loads, especially since rapid adjustments ensure optimal structural adaptation.",
            "Step 5: Considering the complex interplay between different cell types in bone and the influence of various systemic and local signals on bone metabolism, osteocytes' tendency towards inducing resorption under variable conditions likely results in net losses of bone mass unless countered by robust osteogenic activities."
