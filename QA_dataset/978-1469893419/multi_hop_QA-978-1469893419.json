Although there isn't a direct link given between hyperlipidemia and bacterial infections causing Blepharitis, understanding that health issues which compromise overall bodily functions may increase susceptibility to various types of infections, including those causing Blepharitis. Therefore, if someone has hyperlipidemia, indicating broader systemic issues, they might be more prone to developing conditions where immune function plays a role, such as chronic infections or inflammatory responses observed in some cases of Blepharitis and certainly indicative of increased risk for Xanthelasma."

For our purposes, focusing specifically on fasting plasma glucose provides clarity because it gives us a straightforward threshold value to work with.",
            "Step 3: Given the options presented within the classification system regarding fasting plasma glucose values, individuals who fall into the range just before meeting the full criteria for diabetes but still higher than those considered healthy are categorized under prediabetic states. Specifically, the document specifies ranges where patients' health statuses change categorically. Since a level indicating diabetes starts at \u2265126 mg/dL during fasting tests, any amount less than this could theoretically suggest a non-diabetic condition. However, knowing exactly how low one needs to go down the scale helps establish boundaries around terms describing potential precursors to the disease state being asked about here today namely pre diabetic thresholds sitting squarely right beneath outright diagnosis numbers themselves therefore pointing towards looking closely over somewhere slightly lower end yet still visibly distinct compared against completely normative baseline parameters currently set out worldwide too."
