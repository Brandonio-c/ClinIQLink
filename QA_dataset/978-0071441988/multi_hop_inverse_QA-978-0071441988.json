While it's true that only mothers pass on mitochondrial DNA, fathers play a crucial role in passing on X-linked traits, including potentially harmful recessive alleles on the X chromosome to their daughters (who become carriers unless they're homozygous for the mutation) and expressing them themselves if they inherit a dominant allele.
