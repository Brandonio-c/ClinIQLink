        "false_answer": "The liver stores approximately 75% of the body\u2019s vitamin A.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "The given answer is incorrect because according to the paragraph, the liver actually stores 90% of the body\u2019s vitamin A, not 75%. Therefore, the correct statement should reflect the higher storage capacity attributed to the liver in relation to vitamin A reserves.",
        "question": "What percentage of the body's vitamin A does the liver store?",

        "false_answer": "Administration of 500mg of niacin daily for hyperlipidemia treatment.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the given information, niacin at doses of 1.5g/day, or 100 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), is what strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue during the treatment of hyperlipidemia, making 500mg significantly lower than the effective therapeutic dosage mentioned.",

In contrast, according to the given paragraph, multifactorial disorders are actually influenced by both environmental factors and multiple gene interactions, making them more complex rather than purely environmentally driven. Furthermore, these disorders are described as being among the most common types, such as diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension, indicating they are prevalent rather than rare.",
