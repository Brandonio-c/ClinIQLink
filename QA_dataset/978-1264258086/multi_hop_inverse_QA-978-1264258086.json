While tissue kallikrein does indeed play a significant role in cardiovascular physiology by producing kallidin (which later becomes bradykinin after being acted upon by aminopeptidase), there is no evidence suggesting it directly interacts with or processes angiotensin I to produce angiotensin II. That task falls squarely onto ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), highlighting a distinction between the kallikrein-kinin system focused on vasodilation and edema versus the renin-angiotensin system geared towards vasoconstriction and sodium retention.

The paragraph actually emphasizes the unique position of glucose in signaling insulin release and mentions other stimuli like amino acids and incretin hormones but does not suggest that plasma cholesterol plays a direct role in stimulating insulin release above basal levels.
