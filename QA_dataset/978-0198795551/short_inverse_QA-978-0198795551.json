        "incorrect_explanation": "While Braille is indeed a valuable aid for those with visual impairments, the paragraph does not mention it specifically in the context of overcoming communication difficulties in relation to intellectual disability or unique communication styles. Instead, it mentions the use of aids like hearing aids and glasses for sensory deficits, along with strategies such as PECS, symbol dictionaries, Makaton, and sign language. Thus, the correct approach involves these specified methods rather than Braille.",
