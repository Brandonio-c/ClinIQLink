            "Step 2: Understand that among these cases, especially when considering older children beyond two years old or instances of recurrent intussusception, certain underlying causes (pathological leads) might contribute to the development of the intussusceptive process; examples include infections leading to localized areas of hyperplastic change, congenital anomalies like Meckel\u2019s diverticula, or even neoplastic processes such as lymphomas.",

Its non-invasive nature coupled with potential cost savings over prolonged periods makes it attractive compared to other treatments listed.",
            "Step 5: While there are drawbacks associated with traction, such as restricting patient mobility and potential skin pressure issues, these do not negate its utility in providing immediate stabilization following successful reduction of certain types of fractures. Therefore, evaluating the balance between benefits (e.g., no wound creation, low material costs, adjustability) and drawbacks leads us to conclude that traction serves well in specified scenarios where these aspects are prioritized."
