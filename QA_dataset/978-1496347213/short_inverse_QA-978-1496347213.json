        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the paragraph, the prevention of reflux involves two key components working together: the musculature of the right crus of the diaphragm functioning as an extrinsic physiological inferior esophageal sphincter, which contracts and relaxes, often in coordination with the variably thickened muscular coat around the cardial orifice of the stomach. Therefore, stating that the sole mechanism is the thickened muscular coat overlooks the crucial role of the diaphragm's musculature in this process.",
