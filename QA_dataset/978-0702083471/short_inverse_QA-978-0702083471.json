According to the paragraph, patients with renal impairment are identified by a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2), indicating the confusion between units for measuring different aspects of kidney function. Creatinine levels themselves do indicate renal health when interpreted appropriately, typically through calculating eGFR rather than being measured in mL/min/1.73 m^2.
