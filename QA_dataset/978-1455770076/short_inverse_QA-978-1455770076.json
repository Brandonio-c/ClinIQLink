According to the text, however, the maximum amplitude of most sensory receptor potentials is actually around 100 millivolts, occurring only at an extremely high intensity of sensory stimulus.

        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the paragraph, the maternal allele actually has an insulator allowing the binding of a transcriptional repressor, implying repression rather than normal expression. Additionally, it's the paternal DNA sequence that is methylated, leading to the inability of the transcriptional repressor to bind, thereby resulting in the expression of the IGF-2 gene from the paternal copy.

        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the paragraph, potassium channels actually allow potassium ions to pass across the cell membrane about 1000 times more readily than sodium ions, not the reverse. The mechanism involves interaction between the hydrated potassium ions entering the selectivity filter, shedding their bound water molecules upon interacting with carbonyl oxygens lining the filter, thus enabling dehydrated potassium ions to pass through the channel efficiently.

While it's true that many pain fibers from the upper body don't cross until reaching higher levels, suggesting their potential resistance to interruption via traditional cordotomy methods targeting the thoracic spine, saying they remain completely unaffected by any cordotomy overlooks nuances in surgical approaches and the complex nature of pain transmission pathways.

        "false_answer": "The statement claims that after some time passes, there's a notable increase in arterial pressure beyond what was initially observed upon elevating total peripheral resistance.",
        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the given explanation, once the total peripheral resistance is raised acutely, although arterial pressure rises instantly, it generally drops back down to typical values over the course of approximately a single day. This adjustment occurs mainly because the functioning kidneys induce substantial quantities of urine production through processes referred to as 'pressure diuresis' and 'pressure natriuresis', ultimately leading to normalization of both the extracellular liquid amount along with circulation pressures. Therefore, under usual circumstances involving well-functioning kidneys, any sudden spike in systemic vascular opposition doesn't bring about sustained heightened circulatory tension; instead, renal action gradually readjusts it downwards towards standard ranges.",

        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the given information, creatinine is actually not reabsorbed at all, implying any adjustment in its excretion rate upon changes in GFR does not involve altering reabsorption rates since none exist. Instead, what happens is that the decreased GFR temporarily lowers the creatinine excretion rate, leading to an initial buildup of creatinine until its excretion adjusts to match its production rate again, albeit at higher plasma concentrations.

        "incorrect_explanation": "According to the given chapter, specifically discussing how different skin temperatures influence the set point for sweating, it's explained that as the skin temperature decreases, the set point for sweating increases. For instance, if the skin temperature drops to around 29\u00b0C, the hypothalamic set point goes up to approximately 37.4\u00b0C. This indicates that the actual behavior opposite to what's claimed occurs: lowering skin temperature leads to an increase in the set point, thus inhibiting sweating until a higher core temperature is reached.",

In reality, facilitated diffusion involves carrier proteins or channel proteins moving molecules down their electrochemical gradients. For potassium ions, this typically means movement out of the cell, driven by both chemical and electrical potential differences, often involving voltage-gated potassium channels rather than moving against these gradients.\n- **Correct Answer Should Be:** Potassium ions mainly move through the cell membrane via voltage-gated potassium channels, allowing them to follow their electrochemical gradient, usually leaving the cell to help establish and maintain the resting membrane potential.",
