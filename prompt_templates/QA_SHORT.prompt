Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate a **concise, factual question** using only the information provided in the paragraph below. The answer must be **specific, precise, and no longer than 100 words**. Avoid assumptions or external knowledge—your response must be strictly based on the paragraph’s content.

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be entirely based on the provided paragraph.** All information used to generate the question and answer must come directly from the paragraph, without introducing external knowledge or assumptions.  
- **The question must NOT reference the paragraph itself.** Do not use phrases like *"Given the paragraph..."*, *"According to the text..."*, *"Based on the figure..."*, *"As stated above..."*, or anything that assumes the user has access to the original paragraph. The user will only see the QA pair, not the source paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be fully self-contained.** This means the question must include all necessary context to be understandable on its own, without requiring the user to have seen the original paragraph.  
- **Avoid references to figures, tables, or diagrams that are not part of the QA pair.** If a figure is mentioned in the paragraph, either incorporate the relevant details into the question or exclude it altogether—do not refer to "Figure 3.45" or similar external references.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the reasoning is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**
- Craft a **direct, factual question** that asks for a specific detail, fact, or concept explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. The question must be **precise and unambiguous**.  
- The answer **must be concise, containing no more than 100 words**, while still providing complete and verifiable information from the paragraph.  
- Ensure the **question targets a single, well-defined fact**, avoiding broad, open-ended, or general inquiries.  
- Use **clear, unambiguous wording** in both the question and answer to prevent misinterpretation.  
- Avoid questions that require inferencing or additional context outside of the paragraph—**all necessary information must be directly verifiable within the text**.  
- The question should be structured in a **concise and natural format**, such as:  
  - **“What is [specific detail]?”**  
  - **“Who [performed an action]?”**  
  - **“What is the purpose of [concept]?”**  
  - **“Where is [location or entity] found?”**  
  - **“Why does [phenomenon] happen?”** 
  - **“How does [mechanism] work?”**
