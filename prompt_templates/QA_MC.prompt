Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate a **fact-based multiple-choice question** using only the information provided in the paragraph below. The question **must strictly reflect the paragraph’s content** and avoid any external assumptions.

### **General Instructions**
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.
- Ensure that the entire QA pair is fully self-contained, with all necessary context included so that no external references are needed.
- Avoid incorporating any external assumptions, inferences, or context that is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the answer is directly verifiable from the paragraph.
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Construct a **clear and precise** question that directly tests comprehension of a factual concept, relationship, or detail found in the paragraph. The question must not require additional interpretation beyond what is explicitly stated.  
- Ensure that the question **has only one correct answer**, which can be explicitly verified within the paragraph.  
- Generate exactly **four answer choices (A, B, C, D)**, ensuring that one is correct and the other three are plausible but incorrect based on the paragraph. Avoid choices that are too obviously incorrect.  
- Distractors (incorrect options) must be **misleading but not fabricated**—they should be plausible within the context of the paragraph but demonstrably false when checked against the provided information.  
- Avoid ambiguity in the answer choices. Each choice must be **clearly distinct**, without overlap, and must not require subjective interpretation.  
- Ensure that the **correct answer is explicitly stated in the paragraph** and does not require inference beyond what is provided.  
- Structure the multiple-choice options in a **consistent and parallel format** to maintain clarity and avoid giving away the correct answer through grammatical inconsistencies.
