Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate **a factual list-based question and its corresponding answer** using only the information provided in the paragraph below. The answer **must strictly contain items explicitly mentioned in the paragraph**, with no assumptions or additions.

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be entirely based on the provided paragraph.** All information used to generate the question and answer must come directly from the paragraph, without introducing external knowledge or assumptions.  
- **The question must NOT reference the paragraph itself.** Do not use phrases like *"Given the paragraph..."*, *"According to the text..."*, *"Based on the figure..."*, *"As stated above..."*, or anything that assumes the user has access to the original paragraph. The user will only see the QA pair, not the source paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be fully self-contained.** This means the question must include all necessary context to be understandable on its own, without requiring the user to have seen the original paragraph.  
- **Avoid references to figures, tables, or diagrams that are not part of the QA pair.** If a figure is mentioned in the paragraph, either incorporate the relevant details into the question or exclude it altogether—do not refer to "Figure 3.45" or similar external references.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the reasoning is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**
- Formulate a **clear and direct** question that explicitly asks for a **list of items, concepts, steps, or components** found in the paragraph. The question should not imply the need for interpretation or synthesis beyond what is explicitly stated.  
- The question must explicitly ask for a definitive list of items from the paragraph, avoiding partial lists or open-ended phrasing. Do not use words like 'mentioned' or 'stated'; the question must assume the paragraph provides the full set.
- Extract all **distinct, explicitly mentioned list items** from the paragraph. Do not generate additional list items based on inferred information.  
- Format the **Options** section as a bullet-point list, including **all relevant items from the paragraph**, even if some are incorrect or extraneous.  
- Construct the **Answer** section as a bullet-point list, containing **only the correct subset of items** that accurately answer the question. The answer list must **exactly match the items stated in the paragraph** without omissions or modifications.
