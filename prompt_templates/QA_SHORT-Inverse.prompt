Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate a **concise, factual question** using only the information provided in the paragraph below. The answer must be **specific, precise, and no longer than 100 words**. However, the answer must be **false** while still appearing plausible based on the paragraph’s content. The incorrect answer should be subtly misleading but **must contain a specific factual error that contradicts the paragraph**. The goal is to produce a short-answer QA pair where the **question is valid, but the answer is incorrect due to a deliberate but reasonable-seeming mistake**.  

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- Ensure that the entire QA pair is fully self-contained, with all necessary context included so that no external references are needed.  
- Avoid incorporating any external assumptions, inferences, or context that is not explicitly stated in the provided text.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the answer is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Formulate a **concise, direct factual question** that asks about a **specific detail, fact, or concept explicitly mentioned in the paragraph**. The question should be clear, unambiguous, and structured naturally.  
- The **answer must be false**, meaning that it **contradicts a verifiable fact in the paragraph** while still appearing reasonable.  
- **The false answer should introduce a plausible but incorrect piece of information**, such as:  
  - Altering a numerical value (e.g., changing a date, percentage, or measurement).  
  - Swapping related terms, categories, or entities (e.g., misidentifying a person, place, or process).  
  - Stating an incorrect cause-effect relationship.  
  - Providing a mistaken location, classification, or function.  
- **Avoid overly obvious errors or nonsensical answers**—the false answer should be misleading but **subtle enough to seem credible**.  
- **Explicitly identify why the answer is incorrect** by including an `Incorrect Answer Explanation` section that states:  
  - **What the false answer is**  
  - **Why it is incorrect**  
  - **What the correct answer should be**  

### **Response Format**  
<startofQAtext>  
**Question:** [Generate a direct factual question based on the paragraph]  
**Answer:** [Provide a concise but incorrect answer (maximum 100 words)]  

**Incorrect Answer Explanation:**  
- **False Answer Given:** [Restate the incorrect answer]  
- **Why It Is Incorrect:** [Explain the factual error and provide the correct answer based on the paragraph]  
<endofQAtext>
