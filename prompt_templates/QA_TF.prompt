Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate a **factual True/False question** based only on the information in the paragraph below. The question must be **clear, precise, and directly verifiable** from the text, avoiding any assumptions or external knowledge.

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be entirely based on the provided paragraph.** All information used to generate the question and answer must come directly from the paragraph, without introducing external knowledge or assumptions.  
- **The question must NOT reference the paragraph itself.** Do not use phrases like *"Given the paragraph..."*, *"According to the text..."*, *"Based on the figure..."*, *"As stated above..."*, or anything that assumes the user has access to the original paragraph. The user will only see the QA pair, not the source paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be fully self-contained.** This means the question must include all necessary context to be understandable on its own, without requiring the user to have seen the original paragraph.  
- **Avoid references to figures, tables, or diagrams that are not part of the QA pair.** If a figure is mentioned in the paragraph, either incorporate the relevant details into the question or exclude it altogether—do not refer to "Figure 3.45" or similar external references.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the reasoning is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Formulate a **clear, factual statement** that can be **objectively determined as either true or false** based **solely** on the information within the paragraph.  
- The statement **must not contain any ambiguity, inference, or interpretation**—its truth value must be explicitly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- **Ensure that both true and false statements are reasonable** within the context of the paragraph—avoid statements that are trivially false or implausible.  
- **Avoid subjective, opinion-based, or speculative statements**—the statement should be purely factual.  
- **The statement should be structured as a direct factual claim**, such as:  
  - “[Entity] is responsible for [specific action].”  
  - “[Concept] is defined as [specific definition].”  
  - “[Process] occurs in [specific location].”  
  - “[Event] took place in [year or place].”  
  - “[Action] leads to [specific outcome].”  
  - “[Statement] is true/false.”  
  - “[Measurement] is equal to [specific value].”  
  - “[Law/Theory] explains [scientific phenomenon].”  
  - “[Organism/Group] exhibits [specific characteristic or behavior].”  
  - “[Chemical reaction] produces [specific substance].”  
  - “[Anatomical structure] performs [specific function].”  
  - “[Technology] is used for [specific application].”  
  - “[Historical figure] contributed to [specific achievement].”  
  - “[Material] is composed of [specific elements or compounds].”  
  - “[Medical condition] is characterized by [specific symptoms].”  
  - “[Instrument] is used to measure [specific property].”  
- The **answer must be either 'True' or 'False'**, and the determination must be directly supported by the paragraph.
