Forget everything previously known. You are required to generate a **factual True/False question** based only on the information in the paragraph below. The question must be **clear, precise, and directly verifiable** from the text, avoiding any assumptions or external knowledge.

### **General Instructions**
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.
- Ensure that the entire QA pair is fully self-contained, with all necessary context included so that no external references are needed.
- Avoid incorporating any external assumptions, inferences, or context that is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the answer is directly verifiable from the paragraph.
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Formulate a **clear, factual statement** that can be **objectively determined as either true or false** based **solely** on the information within the paragraph.  
- The statement **must not contain any ambiguity, inference, or interpretation**—its truth value must be explicitly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- **Ensure that both true and false statements are reasonable** within the context of the paragraph—avoid statements that are trivially false or implausible.  
- **Avoid subjective, opinion-based, or speculative statements**—the statement should be purely factual.  
- **The statement should be structured as a direct factual claim**, such as:  
  - “[Entity] is responsible for [specific action].”  
  - “[Concept] is defined as [specific definition].”  
  - “[Process] occurs in [specific location].”  
  - “[Event] took place in [year or place].”

  - “[Historical figure] contributed to [specific achievement].”  
  - “[Material] is composed of [specific elements or compounds].”  
  - “[Medical condition] is characterized by [specific symptoms].”  
  - “[Instrument] is used to measure [specific property].”  
- The **answer must be either 'True' or 'False'**, and the determination must be directly supported by the paragraph.
