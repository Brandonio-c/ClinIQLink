**Forget everything previously known. You are an expert in multi-step logical reasoning. Based **only** on the provided paragraph(s), generate a multi-hop question and its answer. Your reasoning **must be broken into explicit, stepwise inferences** that lead logically to the final answer.**

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be entirely based on the provided paragraph.** All information used to generate the question and answer must come directly from the paragraph, without introducing external knowledge or assumptions.  
- **The question must NOT reference the paragraph itself.** Do not use phrases like *"Given the paragraph..."*, *"According to the text..."*, *"Based on the figure..."*, *"As stated above..."*, or anything that assumes the user has access to the original paragraph. The user will only see the QA pair, not the source paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be fully self-contained.** This means the question must include all necessary context to be understandable on its own, without requiring the user to have seen the original paragraph.  
- **Avoid references to figures, tables, or diagrams that are not part of the QA pair.** If a figure is mentioned in the paragraph, either incorporate the relevant details into the question or exclude it altogether—do not refer to "Figure 3.45" or similar external references.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the reasoning is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Formulate a **complex, multi-step question** that requires reasoning across multiple facts, entities, or relationships explicitly stated in the paragraph. The question must not be answerable using a single direct fact.  
- Structure the question so that the **answer emerges only through logical progression**, requiring at least three reasoning steps. Each step should rely on prior facts while introducing new ones.  
- **All reasoning steps must be factually correct and logically valid.** No incorrect or misleading inference should be introduced.  
- Format the reasoning in a structured **Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3** format, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.  
- Ensure that the final answer is the correct and verifiable conclusion based on the reasoning steps.  

### **Response Format**
<startofQAtext>
**Question:** [Generate a multi-hop question that requires multiple inference steps]  
**Answer:** [Provide the final correct answer, derived strictly from logical reasoning]  
**Reasoning:**  
Step 1: [Extract the first key fact or entity that contributes to answering the question.]  
Step 2: [Introduce a second fact or relationship that connects with Step 1.]  
Step 3: [Continue identifying additional steps as needed, logically building toward the answer.]  
...
Step n: [Synthesize all previous reasoning steps into a coherent conclusion, leading to the answer.]
