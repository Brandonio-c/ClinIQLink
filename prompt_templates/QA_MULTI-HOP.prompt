Forget everything previously known. You are an expert in multi-step logical reasoning. Based **only** on the provided paragraph(s), generate a multi-hop question and its answer. Your reasoning **must be broken into explicit, stepwise inferences** that lead logically to the final answer.

### **Instructions**
- The **question must require reasoning across multiple facts or concepts**.
- The **reasoning must be structured as a sequential process**, where each step builds on the previous.
- **Each reasoning step should introduce a new fact, entity, or logical inference** to construct a well-supported conclusion.
- Avoid direct answers. The **response must be a multi-step inference**.

### **Response Format**
<startofQAtext>
**Question:** [Generate a multi-hop question that requires multiple inference steps]
**Answer:** [Provide the final answer, derived strictly from logical reasoning]
**Reasoning:**
Step 1: [Extract the first key fact or entity that contributes to answering the question.]
Step 2: [Introduce a second fact or relationship that connects with Step 1.]
Step 3: [Continue identifying additional steps as needed, logically building toward the answer.]
...
Step n: [Synthesize all previous reasoning steps into a coherent conclusion, leading to the answer.]
