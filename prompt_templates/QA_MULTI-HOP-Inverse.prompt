Forget everything previously known. You are an expert in multi-step logical reasoning. Based **only** on the provided paragraph(s), generate a **multi-hop question with an incorrect answer**. Your reasoning **must be broken into explicit, stepwise inferences**, and **one reasoning step must contain a false but plausible inference**, leading to an incorrect final answer. Additionally, clearly **identify which step contains the incorrect inference** and explain why it is incorrect.  

### **General Instructions**  
- Base every question and answer solely on the information provided in the paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be entirely based on the provided paragraph.** All information used to generate the question and answer must come directly from the paragraph, without introducing external knowledge or assumptions.  
- **The question must NOT reference the paragraph itself.** Do not use phrases like *"Given the paragraph..."*, *"According to the text..."*, *"Based on the figure..."*, *"As stated above..."*, or anything that assumes the user has access to the original paragraph. The user will only see the QA pair, not the source paragraph.  
- **The QA pair must be fully self-contained.** This means the question must include all necessary context to be understandable on its own, without requiring the user to have seen the original paragraph.  
- **Avoid references to figures, tables, or diagrams that are not part of the QA pair.** If a figure is mentioned in the paragraph, either incorporate the relevant details into the question or exclude it altogether—do not refer to "Figure 3.45" or similar external references.  
- Use clear, precise language so that every detail in the reasoning is directly verifiable from the paragraph.  
- Adhere strictly to the required response format for the specific QA type.  
- Do not include references such as **"as seen in"**, **"as shown in the paragraph"**, or **"given the context"**—the QA pair must be fully self-contained.  
- Preserve the original terminology used in the paragraph without rephrasing or summarizing list items.  
- Ensure the QA pair adheres to the **specified response format**, using `<startofQAtext>` and `<endofQAtext>` markers to define the structure.  

### **Specific Instructions**  
- Formulate a **complex, multi-step question** that requires reasoning across multiple facts, entities, or relationships explicitly stated in the paragraph. The question must not be answerable using a single direct fact.  
- Structure the question so that the **answer emerges only through logical progression**, requiring at least two reasoning steps. Each step should rely on prior facts while introducing new ones.  
- **Introduce a deliberate but plausible false inference at any step in the reasoning chain.** This incorrect inference should be subtly misleading but must ultimately lead to a **wrong answer**.  
- The **false inference must be identifiable**, meaning it should contradict the provided paragraph but appear logically consistent within the reasoning steps.  
- The **incorrect inference can occur at any point** in the reasoning chain—it may be introduced early, in the middle, or near the final step leading to the conclusion.  
- **All other reasoning steps should be correct** except for the one containing the false inference, maintaining an otherwise valid logical progression.  
- **The incorrect answer must be logically justified based on the flawed reasoning**, meaning that the answer should be what a reader would conclude if they followed the incorrect step.  
- Format the reasoning in a structured **Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → ... → Step n** format, ensuring the false inference is seamlessly embedded within the logical flow.  
- **Avoid making the false inference overly obvious**—it should be subtly misleading rather than blatantly incorrect, making it challenging but detectable for critical readers.  
- The false inference must be relevant to the question—**do not introduce arbitrary errors or unrelated falsehoods**. Instead, subtly distort a relationship, misinterpret a fact, or introduce a small but impactful factual error.  
- **Explicitly identify which step contains the incorrect inference** in a separate section labeled `Incorrect Reasoning Step`.  
- Clearly **explain why the identified step is incorrect** and what the correct inference should have been.  

### **Reasoning:**  
- **Step 1 - Step (n-1):** Build a logical reasoning chain by extracting key facts and relationships explicitly stated in the paragraph. Each step should naturally lead to the next, forming a coherent multi-hop inference process.  
- **Incorrect Step (Randomly Chosen):** At **any** step in the reasoning chain (**Step 1 through Step n-1**), introduce a **false but plausible inference** that subtly distorts or misinterprets information from the paragraph. The incorrect inference should be misleading but logically structured to seem valid.  
- **Remaining Steps:** Continue building the reasoning chain **as if the incorrect inference were true**, ensuring all subsequent logic follows naturally from the flawed step.  
- **Final Step (Step n):** Synthesize all reasoning steps into a **coherent but incorrect conclusion**, ensuring the answer aligns with the flawed reasoning rather than the actual paragraph content.  

### **Response Format**  
<startofQAtext>  
**Question:** [Generate a multi-hop question that requires multiple inference steps]  
**Answer:** [Provide the final (incorrect) answer, derived strictly from flawed reasoning]  
**Reasoning:**  
Step 1: [Extract the first key fact or entity that contributes to answering the question. (this step could introduce the incorrect inference)]  
Step 2: [Introduce a second fact or relationship that connects with Step 1.(this step could introduce the incorrect inference)]  
... (any step between could introduce the incorrect inference)
Step n-1: [Continue building toward the incorrect conclusion based on the false inference.(this step could introduce the incorrect inference)]  
Step n: [Synthesize all previous reasoning steps into a coherent but incorrect conclusion, leading to the wrong answer.(this step could introduce the incorrect inference))]  

**Incorrect Reasoning Step:**  
- **Step X** contains the incorrect inference.  
- **Explanation:** [Describe why this step is incorrect and what the correct inference should have been based on the paragraph.]
